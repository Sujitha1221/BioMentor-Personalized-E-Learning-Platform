issues pertaining to biology understanding biological diversity at present our planet is rich in diversity life on earth formed around 35 billion years ago the first formed organisms are believed to be heterotrophic anaerobic prokaryotes since then the evolutionary process resulted in the extensive biodiversity which exists in the biosphere now scientists assume based on their studies that there are about 10 million to over 100 million species in the world there is a dynamic relationship between the living world and the inanimate world and each and every organism has a specific role in the environment for existence of the biosphere the variety of life on earth the number of species of plants animals and microorganisms the diversity of genes in these species the different ecosystems on the earth such as deserts rainforests and coral reefs are all part of a biologically diverse earth understanding the human body and its functions when studying biology especially by studying histology and anatomy of the human body one can gain knowledge about the structure of organs this results in understanding and appreciation of the organization of the human body and understanding the functions of different organ systems and the relationship between structure and functions sustainable use and management of natural resources and environment natural resources are sources of materials and energy found naturally which are used in everyday life and for economic development these natural resources are limited on earth due to the increase of growth rate of human population overuse of natural resources is taking place it causes threat of depletion of natural resources due to over exploitation of natural resources various environmental problems arise such as environmental pollution loss of biodiversity desertification hence to overcome the above problems management of natural resources and environment should be practiced knowledge of biology is useful to bring about remedies for the above problems sustainable food production sustainable food production is the production of sufficient amounts of food for the human population using environmentally safe methods the current human population is about 7 billion and expected to be double in less than 40 years therefore for the survival of human beings sustainable food production is necessary to maintain sustainable food production following methods can be applied which are based on knowledge in biology production of high yielding varieties of plants and animals production of disease resistant varieties of plants and animals improve the postharvest technological methods understanding plant life plants are the primary producers in the world all the animals depend directly or indirectly on plants therefore understanding plant life is important as time passes the human population increases hence productivity must be increased therefore understanding plant biology is essential for producing high yielding plants disease resistant plants etc understanding diseases and causes to maintain a healthy human body one should have the knowledge of the causes of the diseases and their effects some dangerous diseases which exist in the current world are noncommunicable diseases such as cancers heart diseases diabetes chronic renal diseases and communicable diseases such as dengue aids etc cancers causes for this is not fully understood yet cancers are one of the leading causes of death aids is a viral disease which is a serious and growing health problem worldwide heart diseases this is also a serious and growing health problem worldwide causes are not fully understood yet chronic renal diseases in sri lanka recently ckdu has become a serious health problem currently scientists are working on prevention remedial measures and cures for such diseases solving some legal and ethical issues knowledge and application of biological concepts is important in solving some legal issues such as parentage testing in criminal investigations and to solve immigration disputes dna fingerprinting is used in above circumstances,biological diversity refers to the variety of life on earth encompassing species genes and ecosystems such as deserts rainforests and coral reefs life began around 35 billion years ago with biodiversity growing through evolution currently scientists estimate there are between 10 to 100 million species on earth understanding human anatomy and physiology helps reveal the structure and function of organs and systems sustainable resource management is critical due to overexploitation leading to environmental issues like pollution and biodiversity loss sustainable food production relies on biologybased methods including developing highyield and diseaseresistant crops plants as primary producers are essential for food chains making the study of plant biology crucial for improving crop yields knowledge of diseases both noncommunicable eg cancers heart diseases and communicable eg aids dengue is vital for public health biological techniques like dna fingerprinting are used in legal cases such as parentage testing and criminal investigations
in accordance with different criteria we can see a diversity among living organisms organisms are diverse based on size shape form and habitats living organisms show a wide range of variation in size shape form and habitat size bacteria1um5 um to giant sequoia giant red wood 100m shape organisms are diverse in shape eg cylindrical earth worm streamline shape birds fish form unicellular amoeba multicellular any plant or animal habitat terrestrial rat aquatic fish arboreal loris aerial birds characteristics of organisms in order to survive each organism whether simple or complex must be able to perform certain functions following features are the characteristics of organisms i order and organization from molecular level to biosphere there is an order and organization in organisms to perform their biological activities efficiently lowerlevel components are organized in a methodical pattern in upper level to make it most efficient plant leaf and human eyes ii metabolism the sum of all chemical activities taking place in an organism is its metabolism it includes catabolic reactions and anabolic reactions iii growth and development all organisms begin their life as a single cell during growth an irreversible increase in dry mass occurs which is characterized only by the living irreversible changes that occur during the life span of an organism is development growth and development are two consequent processes that happen in the life span of organisms iv irritability and coordination irritability is the ability to respond to stimuli from both internal and external environment movement of organisms occurs as a result of irritability and coordination in animals this happens as a result of coordinated efforts of nervous hormonal muscular and skeletal system v adaptation adaptation is a peculiarity of structure physiology or behavior that promotes the likelihood of an organisms survival and reproduction in a particular environment eg sunken stomata in xerophytes viviparity in some mangroves splayed out foot in camels vi reproduction ability to produce offspring for continuous existence of species vii heredity evolution organisms have genes that pass from one generation to the next and control specific physiological morphological and behavioral characters of organisms ability of organisms to change over time as a result of genetic modification is evolution many non living entities may have one or more of these characteristics but not all of them eg crystals grow waves move but only living organisms display all these characteristics simultaneously or at some point during their life cycle by considering this it can be said that these are occurring in single celled organisms as well as highly complex organisms such as humans and anthophytes flowering plants,living organisms show vast diversity in size shape form and habitat they can be as small as bacteria 15 m or as large as the giant sequoia over 100 meters shapes vary from cylindrical like earthworms to streamlined like birds organisms can be unicellular such as amoeba or multicellular like plants and animals habitats range from terrestrial rats to aquatic fish and aerial birds organisms share essential characteristics for survival order and organization biological structures from molecular to ecosystem levels are organized for efficient function metabolism the sum of all chemical reactions including catabolic and anabolic processes growth and development organisms grow by increasing in mass and develop through life changes irritability and coordination ability to respond to stimuli through coordinated systems adaptation features promoting survival like sunken stomata in xerophytes reproduction the ability to produce offspring heredity and evolution genes are passed through generations allowing evolutionary change only living organisms exhibit all these traits simultaneously
physical and chemical properties of water important for life water is a vital inorganic molecule life could not exist on this planet without water it is important due to following reasons 1 vital chemical constituent of living cell 2 provides a biological medium for all organisms physical and chemical properties of water molecule provide the ability to render the vitality water molecule is small polar and angular molecule polarity is an uneven charge distribution within a molecule in water molecule oxygen atom is slightly negative and hydrogen atom is slightly positive weak attractions between the slightly polar hydrogen atom of one water molecule and the slightly polar oxy gen atom of adjacent water molecule are known as hydrogen bonds these hydrogen bonds play a major role in maintaining all the properties of water the properties of water arise due to the hydrogen bonds between different water molecules when the water is in liquid form its h bonds are very fragile h bonds form break and reform with great frequency physical properties of water four major properties of water to maintain life on earth cohesive behavior ability to moderate temperature expansion upon freezing versatility as a solvent 1 cohesive behavior attraction between water molecules due to hydrogen bonding is known as cohesion attraction between water molecules and other substances are known as adhesion both of the above properties of water allow it to act as a transport medium due to cohesion between water molecules water and dissolved substances such as minerals are transported as a continuous column through xylem against gravity adhesion between water molecules and cell walls also helps in conduction of water and dissolved substances water has a high surface tension this ability is given to water molecules due to cohesion between the water molecules therefore in an aquatic system upper surface water molecules are attracted by lower surface molecules and it forms a water film small insects eg water skaters can walk on the surface of a pond 2 ability to moderate temperature water can absorb or release a relatively high amount of heat energy by a slight change in its own temperature due to the high specific heat water will function as thermal buffer in living system and aquatic bodies during the temperature fluctuations on earth due to the high heat of vaporization with the minimum loss of water an organism can release much heat energy this helps the organisms to cool their body surface eg prevent from overheating evaporation of sweat from human skin helps to maintain the body temperature at constant level transpiration in plants helps to cool the plant body surface and prevent from becoming too warm in the sunlight 3 expansion upon freezing generally in an increase in temperature of any substances reduces their density and on the other hand in a decrease in temperature increases their density when the temperature of water falls below 4 c it begins to freeze and forms a crystalline lattice alled ice cubes water has the maximum density at 4c hence ice floats on the surface of water bodies it is an important property of water in polar regions where organisms in aquatic bodies can survive during the winter 4 versatility as a solvent this ability is given to water due to their polarity polar molecules eg glucose ionic compounds eg nacl molecules with both polar and ionic regions eg lysozymes can dissolve in water water molecules surround each of the solute molecules and form hydrogen bonds with them therefore solubility of the solutes depends on polarity and not in their ionic nature,water is an essential molecule for life due to its unique physical and chemical properties it is a polar angular molecule with hydrogen bonds forming between water molecules these hydrogen bonds give water several vital properties cohesive behavior cohesion attraction between water molecules and adhesion attraction to other substances enable water to transport nutrients in plants and form a surface film that supports small organisms temperature moderation waters high specific heat and heat of vaporization allow it to absorb and release heat with minimal temperature changes helping organisms regulate body temperature expansion upon freezing water expands when frozen making ice less dense than liquid water which allows aquatic life to survive under ice in cold environments versatility as a solvent water dissolves polar and ionic substances due to its polarity aiding in various biological reactions these properties make water crucial for sustaining life on earth

proteins are made up of amino acids twenty different amino acids are involved in the formation of proteins elemental composition is c hon and s at the center of the amino acid there is an asymmetric carbon atom except in glycine in addition to this each amino acid is composed of an amino group a carboxyl group a hydrogen atom and a variable group symbolized by r in the case of glycine r is replaced by h atom the r group also called the side chain differs with each amino acid whereas the other groups are in the back bone including the h atom amino acids may have one or more carboxyl groups and amino groups amino group has alkaline nature and carboxyl group has acidic nature when both characteristics are found in one molecule they are known as amphoteric molecules therefore amino acids are amphoteric two amino acids undergo condensation reaction by removing a water molecule and result a bond known as peptide bond oh from one amino acid and h from the other amino acid forms the water molecule protein is composed of one or more polypeptide chains which are composed of amino acids levels of protein structures there are four levels of structure which play important roles in their functions a primary structure the unique sequence of linearly arranged amino acids linked by peptide bonds is the primary structure of proteins b secondary structure the primary structure of a single polypeptide chain coils and folds as a result of intra molecular hydrogen bonds between the oxygen atoms of the carboxy groups and the hydrogen atoms of the amino groups of the same polypeptide chain backbone to form the secondary structure there are two types of secondary structures alpha helix egkeratin beta pleated sheet egspiders silk fiber b tertiary structure usually the secondary polypeptide chain bends and folds extensively forming a precise compact unique functional and threedimensional shape resulting from following interactions between the side chain rgroup of amino acids h bonds disulphide bonds tonic bonds hydrophobic interactions and van der waals interactions egmost of the enzymes myoglobin albumin c quaternary structure aggregation of two or more polypeptide chains involve in the formation of one functional protein separate chains are called protein subunits which were held together by inter and intramolecular interactions eg hemoglobin collagen denaturation of protein is the loss of specific threedimensional shape due to the alteration of weak chemical bonds and interactions agents affecting denaturation 1 high temperature and high energy radiation 2 strong acids alkaline and high concentrations of salts 3 heavy metals 4 organic solvents and detergents,proteins are composed of amino acids with 20 different types involved in their structure each amino acid contains an amino group carboxyl group hydrogen atom and a variable r group amino acids are amphoteric meaning they can behave as both acids and bases proteins form through peptide bonds created by condensation reactions between amino acids resulting in polypeptide chains proteins have four structural levels 1primary structure a linear sequence of amino acids linked by peptide bonds 2secondary structure coiling or folding of the polypeptide chain into alpha helices or beta pleated sheets due to hydrogen bonds 3tertiary structure the 3d shape formed by interactions between side chains including hydrogen bonds disulfide bonds and hydrophobic interactions 4quaternary structure aggregation of multiple polypeptide chains to form a functional protein denaturation occurs when proteins lose their shape due to agents like high temperatures strong acids or heavy metals disrupting their function
nucleic acids are polymers exist as polynucleotides made up of monomers called nucleotides they contain c h o n and p nucleic acids are macromolecules biopolymers there are two types of nucleic acids dna deoxyribo nucleic acids and rna ribonucleic acids structure of nucleotides nucleotides have 3 components namely pentose sugar nitrogenous base and a phosphate group a nucleotide without a phosphate group is called a nucleosideeg adenosine guanosine pentose sugar pentose sugars are two types namely deoxy ribose and ribose in deoxyribose one oxygen atom is less than in ribose nitrogenous bases there are two major groups of nitrogenous bases 1 purines larger in size with two rings 2 pyrimidines smaller in size with a single ring in purines there are two types namely adenine guanine in pyrimidens there are threetypes thyamine uracil and cytocine bases are commonly represented by letters a g t u and c respectively phosphate group it gives the nucleic acids the acidic nature formation of nucleic acids millions of nucleotides join by phosphodiester bond to form polynucleotide chains by condensation between the oh group of the phosphate of one nucleotide and the oh attached to 3 carbon of pentose sugar of the other these bonds result in a backbone with a repeating pattern of sugar phosphate units nucleic acids are linear polymers of nucleotides there are two kinds of nucleic acids depending on the type of the sugar molecules involved if the sugar molecule in the nucleotide is deoxyribose the nucleic acid is dna if the pentose sugar is ribose then the nucleic acid is rna dna contains adenine thymine guanine and cytosine and rna contains adenine guanine cytosine and uracil structure of dna molecule watson and crick model dna molecules have two antiparallel polynucleotide chains that spiral around an imaginary axis forming a double helix the two sugarphosphate backbones run in opposite directions from each other and the arrangement is referred to as antiparallel the sugar phosphate backbones are on the outside of the helix and the nitrogenous bases are paired in the interior of the helix the two strands are held together by hydrogen bonds between the paired nitrogen bases base pair rule always a purine base pairs with a specific pyrimidine base at 2 hydrogen bonds gc 3 hydrogen bonds functions of dna store and transmit genetic information from one generation to the next generation store the genetic information for protein synthesis structure of rna this is normally a single stranded nucleic acid composed of ribonucleotides containing bases uracil u cytosine c guanine g adenine a complementary base pairing between two rna molecules or within the same molecule may occur in some complementary base pairing facilitates three dimensional shapes essential for their functioning adenine binds with uracil with two hydrogen bonds and guanine binds with cytosine with three hydrogen bonds there are three types of rna present in cells 1 messenger rna mrna 2 transfer rna trna 3 ribosomal rna rrna 1messenger rna messenger rna is a linear molecule and is the least abundant type of rna in a cells comparatively there are two functions copies the genetic information stored in dna molecule as a sequence of nitrogenous bases transports genetic information from nucleoplasm to the site of protein synthesis ribosome through nucleopores 2 transfer rna trna smallest rna molecule linear but forms three looped structure 3 ribosomal rna it is the most abundant type of rna rrna has a complex irregular structure it provides the site where polypeptide chains are assembled differences between dna and rna 1 dna is double stranded molecule while rna is a single stranded molecule 2 dna consists of a t g and c and absence of u while rna consists of au g and c and absence of t 3 the sugar molecule in rna is ribose while in dna it is deoxyribose nucleotides other than those found in nucleic acids atp nad nadp fad functions of atp universal energy carrier functions of nad act as acoenzyme act as an electron carrier function as an oxidizing agent during respiration functions of nadp act as coenzymes act as an electron carrier nadp act as an oxidizing agent in photosynthesis functions of fad act as a coenzyme act as an electron carrier act as an oxidizing agent,nucleic acids are large biopolymers that exist as polynucleotides made up of monomers called nucleotides each nucleotide consists of three components a pentose sugar a nitrogenous base and a phosphate group there are two main types of nucleic acids dna deoxyribonucleic acid and rna ribonucleic acid dna contains the sugar deoxyribose and stores genetic information in a doublehelix structure where nitrogenous bases pair as adenine with thymine and guanine with cytosine rna contains ribose sugar and is singlestranded playing a key role in protein synthesis with three types messenger rna mrna transfer rna trna and ribosomal rna rrna nucleic acids are essential for storing and transmitting genetic information and directing the synthesis of proteins additionally nucleotides like atp nad nadp and fad function as coenzymes and electron carriers facilitating energy transfer and oxidationreduction reactions in cellular processes like respiration and photosynthesis
advancement of cytology is mostly based on the microscopy the discovery and early study of cells progressed with the invention of microscope light microscope visible light is passed through the specimen and then through glass lenses the lenses refract the light in such a way that the image of the specimen is magnified as it is projected into the eye the simplest microscope is a single lens the compound light microscope compound light microscopes are commonly used in school laboratories and it is used in medical laboratories as a diagnostic tool resolution power and magnification are important parameters which can be seen in a microscope magnification is the ratio of an objects image size to its actual size usually the maximum magnification of light microscope is 1000 times the actual size of the specimen resolution power is minimum distance between two points that can be distinguished as separate points resolution power of light microscope is 02um it is a measure of the clarity of the image magnification is limited due to the resolution light from an object specimen on the slide passes first through objective lens then produce a magnified image the total magnification is hence the product of the magnification of each lens total magnification magnification of objective lens x magnification of eye piece the electron microscope the limitation imposed upon the resolution power of the light microscope by the wavelength of light the resolution power is inversely proportional to the wavelength due to this scientists considered the use of other forms of radiations with comparatively shorter wavelengths as a result electron microscopes were developed in electron microscopy a beam of electrons is focused through the specimen or on to its surface in practice electron microscope magnifies about 5105 times with a resolution about 2 nm electron microscopes have revealed many organelles and other sub cellular structures those were impossible resolve with the light microscopes there are two types of electron microscopes 1 transmission electron microscopes tem 2 scanning electron microscopes sem transmission electron microscopes it is used to study the internal structures of cells in this microscope a beam of electrons is passed through a thin especially prepared slice of material a very thin specimen is used specimens stained with heavy metals which attach more to certain cellular structures than other areas image reflects the pattern of electrons passed through the specimen displays on a screen while electrons pass through the specimen more electrons may get displayed in regions where structures were densely stained scanning electron microscopes in this instrument a fine beam of electrons is reflected from the surface of specimen specimen is mostly coated with gold prior to observation here the specimen scatters many electrons whereas others are absorbed this instrument is ideal to observe the surface view in three dimensional appearances,the advancement of cytology has been largely driven by the development of microscopes the light microscope uses visible light to pass through specimens magnified through glass lenses a compound light microscope commonly used in schools and medical labs can magnify specimens up to 1000 times their actual size the resolution power of a light microscope is the ability to distinguish between two separate points with a limit of 02 m magnification is the product of the objective lens and eyepiece magnifications the electron microscope surpasses the limitations of light microscopes by using a beam of electrons providing much higher magnification up to 500000x and superior resolution around 2 nm there are two main types transmission electron microscope tem focuses on internal structures by passing electrons through a thin stained specimen showing detailed internal cell organization scanning electron microscope sem focuses on surface structures producing 3d images by reflecting electrons off the specimens goldcoated surface electron microscopes have revolutionized cell biology by revealing structures unseen by light microscopes
cell theory all organisms are composed of cells recall the hierarchy of life the levels of organization mentioned earlier the basic unit which can be called living is the cell which may form a single celled organism egchlamydomonas yeast or a multicellular plant or animal the cell is the basic structural and functional unit of life the level of organization of matter represented by a cell shows all the characteristics of life any stage below level of a cell cannot be considered living whether it is a single celled organism or multicellular plant or an animal robert hooke 1665 examined a cork using simple microscope and gave the term cell to describe the basic units anton van leeuwenhook 1650 a contemporary of robert hooke was the fi rst to describe and record living single celled organisms euglena bacteria matthias schleiden 1831 a botanist studying plant tissues concluded that all plants are made up of cells theodore schwann a zoologist 1839 concluded that animal tissues are also made up of cells rudolf virchow 1855 showed that all cells arise from preexisting cells by cell division schleiden schwann and virchow presented the cell theory which included the following 1all organisms are composed of one or more cells 2the basic structural and functional unit of organisms is the cell 3all cells arise from preexisting cells organization of cells there are two kinds of cellular organization prokaryotic and eukaryotic all cells share certain basic features they are all cells are bounded by a plasma membrane which is a selective barrier within the cell have a semifl uid jelly like substance which is called cytosol subcellular components are suspended within the cytosol they carry dna as genetic materials ribosomes are found in all cells the differences between prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells differ in several key aspects prokaryotic organisms include bacteria and archaebacteria while eukaryotic organisms encompass protists fungi plants and animals prokaryotic cells are generally smaller with a diameter of 15m whereas eukaryotic cells range from 10m to 100m in diameter prokaryotes are mainly unicellular while eukaryotes are primarily multicellular although some protists and fungi can be unicellular evolutionarily prokaryotes appeared around 35 billion years ago whereas eukaryotes evolved 18 billion years ago from prokaryotes cell division in prokaryotes occurs via binary fission without mitosis or meiosis while eukaryotes divide through mitosis meiosis or both prokaryotic genetic material consists of circular dna that is free in the cytoplasm in a region called the nucleoid and is not associated with proteins in contrast eukaryotic dna is linear contained within a nucleus and associated with proteins prokaryotes have 70s ribosomes which are smaller while eukaryotes possess both 70s ribosomes in mitochondria and chloroplasts and 80s ribosomes with the latter sometimes attached to the endoplasmic reticulum prokaryotic cells have few organelles none of which are membranebound and internal membranes are sparse often associated with processes like respiration photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation eukaryotic cells on the other hand are rich in membranebound organelles including the nucleus mitochondria and chloroplasts each with double membranes as well as lysosomes and vacuoles with single membranes the cell walls of prokaryotes differ depending on the organism with bacteria having peptidoglycan while archaebacteria have polysaccharides and proteins in eukaryotes plant cells have cellulose in their cell walls while fungi have chitin and animal cells lack cell walls flagella in prokaryotes are simple lacking microtubules and exist extracellularly with a diameter of about 20nm in eukaryotes flagella are more complex with a 92 arrangement of microtubules and are intracellular with a larger diameter of 200nm prokaryotes typically rely on mesosomes for respiration while eukaryotes use mitochondria for aerobic respiration photosynthesis in prokaryotes occurs on membranes that are not stacked whereas eukaryotic cells contain chloroplasts with stacked membranes organized into lamellae or grana finally while some prokaryotes can fix nitrogen eukaryotes lack this ability,cell theory states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells the cell is the basic structural and functional unit of life and all cells arise from preexisting cells through division the theory was developed by schleiden schwann and virchow robert hooke first coined the term cell in 1665 while anton van leeuwenhoek was the first to observe living cells cells are either prokaryotic or eukaryotic prokaryotic cells eg bacteria are smaller lack a nucleus and reproduce by binary fission eukaryotic cells eg plants animals have a nucleus membranebound organelles and divide via mitosis or meiosis shared features of all cells plasma membrane cytosol jellylike fluid dna as genetic material ribosomes for protein synthesis prokaryotic cells have simpler structures and smaller ribosomes 70s while eukaryotes possess both 70s in mitochondriachloroplasts and 80s ribosomes key differences also include cell wall composition flagella structure and organelle presence
plasmamembrane is the outer limit of cytoplasm all cellular membranes resemble the ultra structure of plasma membrane in 1972 singer and nicolson put forward the fluid mosaic model of cell membrane it is mainly composed of phospholipids most abundant type of lipid in plasma membrane protein the plasma membrane has the following features it is about 7nm thick it is mainly made up of a phospholipid bilayer phospholipids are amphipathic molecules the hydrophilic heads of the phospholipids face outwards into the aqueous environment of both inside and outside of the cell the hydrophobic hydrocarbon tails face inwards and create a hydrophobic interior plasmamembrane is compared to the fluid mosaic model since phospholipid molecules are moveable they provide the fluid nature to the membrane protein molecules embedded randomly contribute to its mosaic nature some of the protein molecules penetrate all the way through the membrane called transmembrane proteins and some others penetrate only part of the way into the membrane these are called integral proteins some proteins and lipids have short branching carbohydrate chains like antennae forming glycoprotein and glycolipids respectively animals cell membrane may contain few cholesterol molecules randomly integrated into the lipid bilayer these cholesterol molecules provide flexibility and stability to the membrane by reducing membrane fluidity at moderate temperatures and prevent membrane solidification at low temperatures the two sides of the membrane may differ in composition and function functions the plasma membrane surrounds the cytoplasm of living cell physically separating the intracellular components from the extracellular environment plasma membrane is selectively permeable and able to regulate the exchange of material needed for survival proteins embedded in the plasma membrane identify the cell enabling nearby cells to communicate with each other involved in cell recognition some protein molecules act as receptor molecules for interacting with specific biochemical such as hormones neurotransmitters and immune proteins some proteins in the cell membrane attach to some cytoskeletal fibers and help to maintain the shape of the cell some proteins in the membrane act as enzymes egmicrovillus on epithelial cell lining of some parts of the gut contains digestive enzymes in their cell surface membrane,the plasma membrane the outer boundary of the cytoplasm follows the fluid mosaic model proposed by singer and nicolson in 1972 it is composed of phospholipids proteins and sometimes cholesterol the membranes phospholipid bilayer is amphipathic with hydrophilic heads facing outward and hydrophobic tails inward creating a fluid flexible structure key features include phospholipids provide fluidity to the membrane proteins randomly embedded some span the entire membrane transmembrane while others are partially embedded integral they contribute to the mosaic nature cholesterol present in animal cells stabilizes the membrane by adjusting fluidity based on temperature functions selective permeability regulates the exchange of materials cell recognition protein molecules identify the cell and enable communication receptor function proteins interact with hormones and neurotransmitters structural support proteins attach to cytoskeletal fibers enzymatic activity membranebound proteins function as enzymes eg digestive enzymes in the gut
there are many subcellular components in the cell some of them are organelles which are bound by membranes and suspended in the cytosol of eukaryotic cell to perform specialized functions nucleus most prominent organelle consist most of the genes having an average diameter of and enclosed by a double membrane cover called nuclear envelope nuclear envelope composed of two membranes inner and outer membranes separated by a space of 2040 nm nuclear envelope is perforated by nuclear pores which has pore complex to regulate the entry and exit of substances it has nuclear lamina made up of protein fi laments which line the interior side of the nuclear envelope nuclear matrix is made up of protein fi laments and extended throughout the interior of the nucleus chromatin and nucleolus are embedded in the nuclear matrix nucleolus appears as darkly stained granules with fi bers adjoining part of the chromatin chromatin appears as a diffused mass in electron micrographs of non dividing cells it is a complex of dna and proteins during nuclear divisions chromatin condenses tightly coils and form threads called chromosomes each species has a constant number of chromosomes eg typical human cell has 46 chromosomes functions control all cellular activities synthesize dna to produce new nuclei for cell divisions synthesize rrnas and ribosomal subunits required for protein synthesis through nucleolus synthesize mrna and trna according to the information present on the dna store and transport genetic information ribosomes these are subcellular components which carryout protein synthesis they consist of two subunits larger subunit and smaller subunit they are composed of rrna and protein ribosomes are found in two types 70s and 80s 70s ribosomes are found freely on the cytoplasam of prokaryotes matrix of mitochondria and stroma of chloroplasts 80s ribosomes are found only in eukaryotes based on the nature of presence 80s ribosomes are categorized as two types free ribosomes and bound ribosomes free ribosomes freely available as group in cytoplasam bound ribosomes are attached to the membrane surface of rough endoplasmic reticulum functions protein synthesis endoplasmic reticulum it is a network of internal membranes forming flattened or tubular sacs separating cytosol from er lumen it is continuous with the outer membrane of nuclear envelope there are two types of er rough er and smooth er rough er rough er consists of flattened sacs and ribosomes bound to surface proteins synthesized by ribosomes move into lumen of er functions transport protein synthesized by ribosomes synthesizing glycoproteins produce transport vesicles facilitate the growth of own membrane by adding phospholipids proteins and carbohydrates therefore called as membrane factory smooth er smooth er is a network of tubular sacs without ribosomes membrane bound enzymes are present functions it synthesizes lipids including oils steroids and phospholipids metabolism of carbohydrates produce transport vesicles to transport within cell involves in detoxification stores ca2 ions golgi apparatus golgi apparatus is a stacks of fl attened sacs or cisternae inner and outer surfaces can be identifi ed as cis face and transface respectively cis face is located near the er to receive vessicles from er trans face give rise to secretory vessicles which budded off and travel other side golgi complex is abundant in secretory cells functions collecting packaging and distribution of materials manufacturing cellulose and non cellulose cell wall components such as pectin produce lysosomes lysosomes they are single membrane bounded vesicles contributing to digestive activity they contain hydrolytic enzymes which catalyze breakdown of carbohydrates proteins lipids and nucleic acids functions digest food particles received by phagocytosis transport residue material out of cell by exocytosis digest worn out organelles autolysis causing cell death peroxisome they are single membrane bounded vesicles with oxidizing enzymesthey are present in both plants and animals enzymes in peroxysome catalyze the breakdown of h2o2 functions detoxification of peroxides photorespiration in plants specialized peroxysomes called glyoxysomes are found in fat storing tissues in plants glyoxysomes converts fatty acids into sugar mitochondria it is one of the most common organelles in eukaryotic cells it is an elongated organelle with two enclosing membranes outer membrane is smooth but the inner membrane is convoluted to form cristae cristae increase the surface area and they contain stalk particles the gapspace in between inner and outer membranes of the mitochondrion is called intermembrane space the inner most part of the organelle is known as mitochondrial matrix which consists of 70 s ribosomes circular dna chloroplast it is a biconvex lens shaped organelle with two membranes which is found in plants and some protists the outer and inner membranes are smooth and are separated by a very narrow intermembrane space inside the chloroplast there is another membrane system this membrane produces flattened and interconnected sacks called thylakoids thylakoids contain complexes called photosystems which are made up of photosynthetic pigments thylakoids stacked to form a granum the grana are interconnected by inter granal lamellae the fluid outside the thylakoid is stroma which contain circular dna chloroplast dna 70s ribosomes many enzymes starch granules and lipid droplets functions photosynthesis cytoskeleton cytoskeleton is the supporting structure of the cell and maintains its shape it is more important for animal cells which lack cell walls cytoskeleton is made out of microtubules and protein fi laments additionally it is dynamic hence has the ability to break and reform as needed there are three types of components in the cytoskeleton as follows microtubules actin fi laments or microfilaments intermediate fi laments differences between microtubules microfilaments laments and intermediate filaments microtubules are hollow tubes with their walls consisting of 13 columns of tubulin molecules the protein subunits are tubulin and their main functions include maintaining cell shape enabling cell motility such as in cilia or flagella chromosome movements during cell division and organelle movements microfilaments or actin filaments consist of two intertwined strands of actin each of which is a polymer of actin subunits their functions include maintaining cell shape by bearing tension facilitating changes in cell shape enabling muscle contraction aiding cytoplasmic streaming in plant cells contributing to cell motility such as in pseudopodia and assisting in cell division in animal cells through the formation of the cleavage furrow intermediate filaments are composed of fibrous proteins that are supercoiled into thicker cables the protein subunits vary depending on the cell type with keratin being one example intermediate filaments primarily maintain cell shape by bearing tension anchor the nucleus and certain other organelles and form the nuclear lamina functions provide strength to the cytoplasm anchorage organelles and cytosolic enzymes of the cell movement of cytoplasm cytoplasmic streaming positioned organelles and move chromosomes when necessary maintain the shape of the cell mainly in animal cells cilia and flagella cilia and flagella share a common structure flagella are long elongated structures and cilia are short cellular projections that are often organized in rows cilia are more numerous than flagella on the cell surface they are made of microtubules with a 92 structure nine doublets of microtubules are arranged in a ring with two single microtubules in its center they are covered by plasma membrane and bound to a basal body which anchors the cilium or flagellum to the cell the basal body has 9 0 arrangement no microtubules in its center functions act as locomotor appendages can move fluid over the surface of the tissue cilia lining in oviducts help move an egg toward the uterus centrioles centriole is made up of cylindrically arranged microtubules which are non membrane bounded subcellular component present only in animal cells each centriole composed of nine sets of triplet microtubules arranged in a ring 90 a pair of centrioles which arranged perpendicular to each other are located in a region called centrosome near the nucleus functions produce aster and spindle in cell division central vacuole central vacuole is a large structure bound by tonoplast filled with liquid called cell sap found in plant cells the composition of sap differs from cytosol and it contains water ions such as potassium and chloride and sometimes water soluble colored pigments such as anthocyanin functions stores water and other materials such as sugars ions and pigments maintains water balance of the cell gives turgidity and support to cell produce colours in some plants with sap pigments stores soluble substances needed for cellular activities,cells contain numerous subcellular components some of which are membranebound organelles that perform specialized functions nucleus the control center of the cell enclosed by a nuclear envelope with pores contains chromatin dnaprotein complex and nucleolus responsible for synthesizing rrna and ribosomal subunits ribosomes sites of protein synthesis found as free or bound with 70s in prokaryotes and 80s in eukaryotes endoplasmic reticulum er rough er synthesizes proteins while smooth er synthesizes lipids and detoxifies substances golgi apparatus modifies packages and distributes materials also produces lysosomes lysosomes contain enzymes for digesting macromolecules and recycling cell parts mitochondria powerhouse of the cell produces atp through cellular respiration chloroplasts in plants conduct photosynthesis cytoskeleton maintains cell shape and enables movement through microtubules actin filaments and intermediate filaments cilia and flagella provide cell motility vacuoles store water and other materials maintaining cell structure in plants these components work together to ensure cellular function and survival
1 cell wall cell wall is an extracellular structure of plant cells animal cells do not have cell walls however prokaryotes fungi and some protists also have a thin and flexible cell wall the chemical composition of the wall greatly varies from species to species and even from one cell type to another even in the same plant nevertheless in plants cell wall is generally made up of cellulose pectin hemicellulose lignin and suberin in some plant cells only plants generate two types of cell walls primary and secondary walls young cells first secrete primary cell wall it is the wall laid down during plant cell division just outside the primary wall there is a thin layer middle lamella which is rich in sticky polysaccharides called pectins magnesium and calcium pectate middle lamella glues adjacent cells together due to the deposition of hardening substances on the primary wall a secondary cell wall is generated secondarily primary cell wall is permeable relatively thin flexible composed mainly of cellulose fibers which are laid unevenly running through the extracellular matrix middle lamella water can move freely through the free spaces of cell wall secondary cell wall lies between plasma membrane and primary cell wall it contains several layers of hard materials forming a rigid structure in addition to cellulose impermeable substances such as lignin and suberine are also incorporated in to the secondary wall lignin cement anchors cellulose fibers together providing hard and rigid matrix giving the cell wall an extra support cell wall has pits through which cytoplasm of adjoining cells join through plasmodesmata functions protection and support allows development of turgidity when water enters the cell prevents bursting during turgidity limits and control cell growth component of appoplast pathway maintaining cell shape hold the plant up against the force of gravity 2 cell junctions cell junctions are structures at which neighbouring plasma membranes are joined they are also interact and communicate via sites of direct physical contacts functions connects the internal chemical environment of adjacent cells cell junctions are structures at which cytoplasm of adjoining cells are joined there are three types of cell junctions in animal cells tight junctions connect the plasma membranes of adjacent cells tightly bound by specific proteins forming continuous seals around the cells prevent leakages of extracellular fluids through intercellular space eg skin epithelium desmosomesanchor junctions mechanically attach the cytoskeletons of adjoining cells by intermediate fi laments for strong binding eg muscle tissue gap junctions communicating junctions provide cytoplasmic channels from one cell to an adjescent cell gap junctions consists of special membrane proteins that surround the pore through which ions sugars amino acids may pass they allow signal and material exchange between adjacent cells through direct connections eg heart muscles animal embryo cell wall has pits through which cytoplasm of adjoining cells join through plasmodesmata functions protection and support allows development of turgidity

provide cytoplasmic channels from one cell to an adjacent cell gap junctions consists of special membrane proteins that surround the pore through which ions sugars amino acids may pass they allow signal and material exchange between adjacent cells through direct connections eg heart muscles animal embryo plasmodesmata microscopic channels which runs through plant cell walls they are cytoplasmic living connections between cytoplasm of adjoining cells these are membrane lined channels filled with cytoplasm extracellular matrix of animal cells although animal cells lack cell walls they do have elaborate extracellular matrix ecm main components of the ecm are glycoproteins and other carbohydrates containing molecules secreted by the cells most abundant glycoprotein in the ecm of most animal cell is collagen which forms strong fibres outside the cell the collagen fibres are embedded in a network woven out of proteoglycan secreted by cells functions forms a protective layer over the cell surface linking extra cellular matrix and cytoskeleton influences the cell behavior by involving in the mechanical and chemical signaling,1 cell wall the cell wall is a rigid extracellular structure in plant cells made of cellulose pectin hemicellulose lignin and suberin it provides protection support and maintains cell shape it consists of a primary wall flexible and permeable and a secondary wall rigid and impermeable functions protection structural support maintaining turgidity limiting cell growth and facilitating celltocell communication through plasmodesmata

the sequence of events that takes place in the cell from the end of one cell division to the end of the next cell division is referred to as cell cycle at the end of the cell division two genetically identical daughter cells resembling the parent cell are produced in mitosis eukaryotic cell cycle mitosis eukaryotic cell cycle may divide into two major phases interphase mitotic phase mphase interphase is the longer phase of cell division it covers about 90 of the cell cycle interphase could be divided into three phases g 1 phase first gap phase s phase synthetic phase g 2 phase second gap phase g1 phase in this phase synthesis of proteins and production of cellular organelles leading to cell growth occur proteins essential for s phase are produced during this phase s phase dna replication occurs and synthesis of histone proteins takes place dna wind around histone beads and form chromatin g 2 phase cells continue to grow through protein synthesis as well as cellular organelles proteins essential for mitotic phase will be synthesized duplication of centrosomes takes place there are cell cyclecontrolling checkpoints available at g1 g2 and m phases to ensure that the cell is ready for moving into upcoming phases of cell division some cells receive a gohead signal at the g1 check point it will usually complete the g1 s g2 and m phases and divide if it does not receive a go head signal at that point it may exit the cycle entering into a non dividing stage called the go phase the most cells of the human body are actually in the go phase eg nerve cells and muscle cells mitotic phase m phase m phase covers only about 10 of cell cycle this includes mitosis and cytokinesis mitosis mitosis is referred to the nuclear division which gives rise to two genetically identical daughter nuclei from a mother nucleus this may get divided into five stages prophase prometaphase metaphase anaphase and telophase in order to ease the learning of activities of cell cycle 1 prophase chromatin fibers get condensed by shortening and thickening and transformed into chromosomes as a result chromosomes will be visible through light microscope nucleoli get disappeared and chromosomes appear with two sister chromatids attached at the centromere chromosomal arms of sister chromatids attached by special proteins called cohesion the formation of mitotic spindles begins spindle includes the centrosomes the spindle microtubules and the aster centrosomes move toward opposite poles of the cell due to the lengthening of microtubules between them 2 prometaphase the nuclear envelope fragments chromosomes get even more condensed a special protein called kinetochore attaches the sister chromatids of each chromosome at their centromere some of the microtubules that attach to the kinetochore of the chromosomes move the chromosomes back and forth microtubules which are not attached to the kinetochore interact with those from the opposite poles 3 metaphase centrosomes reach the opposite poles the chromosomes have arrived to a place called metaphase plate which is located in equal distance from each pole the centromeres of all chromosomes are located in the metaphase plate at the end of this phase each chromosome of the cell get attached to the kinetochore microtubule at their centromere and aligned at the metaphase plate 4 anaphase sister chromatids are separated at the centromere microtubules attached to kinetochore get shorten and pull sister chromatids towards the opposite poles cell elongates as the non kinetochore microtubules are lengthen by the end of anaphase equal and complete set of chromosomes found at each pole of the cell 5 telophase nuclear envelope reforms around each set of chromosomes at opposite poles nucleoli reappears spindle microtubules get deplolymerized chromosomes unwind and become less condense to form chromatin two genetically identical daughter nuclei are formed cytokinesis the division of the cytoplasam starts at the end of the telophase therefore at the end of the mitosis two genetically identical daughter cells are produced in animal cells a cleavage furrow forms this produces two genetically identical daughter cells in plant cells cell plate forms as a result of vesicle produced by golgi apparatus this divides the cytoplasm in to two and generates two genetically identical daughter cells to the parent cell significances of mitosis 1 maintains the genetic stability 2 growth and development 3 cell repair replacement and regeneration 4 asexual reproduction,the cell cycle is the sequence of events from one cell division to the next producing two genetically identical daughter cells through mitosis the eukaryotic cell cycle consists of two main phases interphase 90 of the cycle and the mitotic phase m phase interphase is divided into three stages g1 phase cell growth and protein synthesis occur s phase dna replication takes place forming chromatin g2 phase further growth and preparation for mitosis including centrosome duplication mitosis involves five stages prophase chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes mitotic spindles begin to form prometaphase the nuclear envelope breaks down and kinetochores attach to chromosomes metaphase chromosomes align at the metaphase plate anaphase sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles telophase nuclear envelopes reform and chromosomes unwind cytokinesis divides the cytoplasm forming two daughter cellscleavage furrow in animals and cell plate in plants mitosis is crucial for genetic stability growth repair and asexual reproduction
sexually reproducing organisms undergo different type of cell division called meiosis meiosis meiosis is a type of nuclear division which gives rise to four haploid genetically non identical daughter nuclei from a diploid mother nucleus meiosis involves two consecutive nuclear divisions meiosis i and meiosis ii meiosis i is a reduction division and meiosis ii is similar to mitosis each stage consists of four subphases prophase metaphase anaphase and telophase before meiosis one cell is in interphase during s phase of the interphase dna replication occur meiosis i 1 prophase i cell enters to the prophase from interphase chromosomes begin to condense nucleolus begins to disappear next the formation of zipper like structure called the synaptonemal complex by a specific proteins holds two homolg tightly together the pairing and physical connection of homologous chromosomes is called synapsis during synapsis part of the dna molecule of nonsister chromatids paired homologous chromosomes break exchange and rejoin at corresponding point this process is called crossing over these points of crossing over become visible as chiasmata after the synaptonemal complex dissembles and the homologous chromosomes slightly apart from each other nuclear envelop breaks centrosomes move towards opposite poles forming spindle in animal cells the kinetochore of each homologue attach to microtubule from one pole or the other the homologous pair then moves toward the metaphase plate 2 metaphase i the pair of homologous chromosomes get arranged on the metaphase plate with one chromosome of each pair faces each pole both chromatids of a homologue are attached to kinetochore microtubules from one pole and those of the other homolog are attached to kinetochore microtubules from the opposite pole homologous chromosome arrange randomly at metaphase plate 3 anaphase i kinetochore microtubules of the spindle get shorten homologous pair separates and one chromosome of each pair moves towards the opposite pole sister chromatids of each chromosome remain attached at the centromere and move as a single unit towards the same pole 4 telophase i one complete haploid set of chromosomes accumulate at each pole nuclear envelope reforms around each set of chromosomes nucleoli reappear spindle disintegrates chromosomes decondensed into chromatin genetically non identical haploid two daughter nuclei are formed within one cell cytokinesis usually occurs simultaneously with telophase i genetically non identical haploid two daughter cells are formed in animal cells cleavage furrow is formed in plant cells a cell plate is formed no dna replication occurs between meiosis i and meiosis ii meiosis ii 1 prophase ii centrosomes start producing spindle apparatus spindle fibers aster centrosome chromatin fibers condense and produce chromosomes with two sister chromatids nuclear envelope breaks down into fragments nucleolus disappears during the late prophase ii centromere of the chromosomes are moved to the metaphase ii plate 2 metaphase ii all chromosomes get attached to the microtubules at their centromere and aligned on the metaphase plate kinetochores of sister chromatids are attached to microtubules extending from both poles due to the crossing over in meiosis i the two sister chromatids of each chromosome are not genetically identical meiosis ii usually takes place in the perpendicular direction of meiosis i therefore metaphase plate of meiosis ii is perpendicular to the metaphase plate of meiosis i 3 anaphase ii due to the breakdown of proteins attaching sister chromatids they are separated at centromere as a result of shortening of microtubules sister chromatids of each chromosome move towards opposite poles 4 telophase ii nuclear envelope and nucleolus reform chromosomes decondense into chromatin spindle disassembles genetically non identical haploid four daughter nuclei are formed from one parent cell cytokinesis cytokinesis occurs as in mitosis genetically non identical haploid four daughter cells are formed these four daughter cells are not even identical to their parent cell centrosomes or centrioles are not available in plant cells however spindle is formed during cell division from accumulated microtubule complex significance of meiosis maintains the constant number of chromosomes through generations in sexually reproducing species producse new genetic variations leading to evolution genetic variation occurs due to crossing over recombination and independent assortment tumor cancer and galls cell division is driven by external and internal factors they may be chemical or physical factors cancer cells do not respond to normally to the bodys control mechanism they divide excessively and invade other tissues if unchecked they can kill the organism significance of meiosis maintains the constant number of chromosomes through generations in sexually reproducing species producse new genetic variations leading to evolution genetic variation occurs due to crossing over recombination and independent assortment tumor cancer and galls cell division is driven by external and internal factors they may be chemical or physical factors cancer cells do not respond to normally to the bodys control mechanism they divide excessively and invade other tissues if unchecked they can kill the organism galls in plants this occurs due to uncontrolled mitotic division of plant cell the plant cell division is controlled by maintaining a proper balance between plant growth regulators such as auxins and cytokinins when this balance is lost plant cells produce undifferentiated mass of cells galls are the bumbs and growths that develop on different parts of plants after being invaded by some very unique organisms galls have range of causes including viruses fungi bacteria insects and mites usually the gall causers in some way attack or penetrate the plants growing tissues and causes the host to reorganize its cells and to develop an abnormal growth,meiosis is a type of nuclear division in sexually reproducing organisms resulting in four haploid genetically nonidentical daughter nuclei from a diploid mother nucleus it consists of two stages meiosis i reduction division and meiosis ii similar to mitosis key stages of meiosis i include prophase i chromosomes condense homologous chromosomes pair synapsis and crossing over occurs creating chiasmata metaphase i homologous pairs align at the metaphase plate anaphase i homologous chromosomes separate to opposite poles while sister chromatids remain attached telophase i and cytokinesis two haploid daughter nuclei form meiosis ii follows without dna replication featuring similar stages to mitosis the significance of meiosis includes maintaining chromosome number and promoting genetic variation through processes like crossing over and independent assortment additionally abnormal cell division can lead to tumors cancer or galls in plants caused by uncontrolled mitotic division
sum of all biochemical reactions of living being is known as the metabolism and it consists of all catabolic and anabolic reactions catabolism is breaking down of complex molecules into simple molecules by releasing free energy therefore it is an exergonic reaction anabolism is making complex molecules from the simple molecules by absorbing free energy hence it is an endergonic reaction biochemical reactions involved in usage of energy released by catabolic reactions in living system are called as anabolic reactions atp acts as the energy carrier in all living organism including the simplest bacteria therefore the atp is known as the universal currency of energy transactions energy can be defined as the capacity to do work all living organisms require energy for their living process in many ways such processes are synthesis of substances active transport across plasma membrane transmission of nerve impulses muscle contraction beating of cilia and flagella bioluminescence electrical discharges overall idea of the energy relations of living system on biosphere is composed of following steps energy flows into biological systems from the environment through solar radiation primary energy source is the sun light energy is captured in the cells having photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll by the process of photosynthesis and stored as chemical energy in the organic compounds such as carbohydrates captured energy in organic food is transformed into chemical energy in atp by a process called cellular respiration the energy stored in atp is utilized in various energy requiring processes atp adenosine tri phosphate atp is a nucleotide consisting of ribose sugar adenine nitreogenous base a chain of three phosphate groups during the hydrolysis of atp adp and pi are produced as a result a very high energy is released this is because the reactants atp and water contain more energy in comparison to products adp and pi therefore it yields energy and is an exergonic reaction when atp is hydrolyzed the free energy yield of each of the two end phosphate groups is 305kjmol most biological reactions use the energy released during breaking of the terminal phosphate bond atp is mobile therefore it can carry energy to anywhere in the cell for any energy consuming reaction atp can be produced within living cells within a short period of time using adp inorganic phosphate pi and energy production of atp within cells is called phosphorylation according to the energy source phosphorylation is divided as there are three primary types of atp synthesis mechanisms each differing in how energy is utilized to produce atp photophosphorylation refers to the synthesis of atp using solar energy during the process of photosynthesis this occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells where light energy is captured and converted into chemical energy ii substratelevel phosphorylation involves the synthesis of atp by utilizing the energy released from the breakdown of complex molecules into simpler ones this process occurs directly during metabolic reactions such as in glycolysis and the citric acid cycle iii oxidative phosphorylation is the synthesis of atp using the energy released as a result of the oxidation of molecules this process takes place in the mitochondria during cellular respiration and involves the electron transport chain and chemiosmosis in living cells energy in atp is transformed into various energy forms which are used for different functions the role of enzymes in regulating metabolic reactions an enzyme is a macromolecule which acts as a biological catalyst enzymes are produced in living cells general characteristics of an enzyme 1 most of the enzymes are globular proteins 2 enzymes are biological catalysts they lower the activation energy of the reaction they catalyze increases the rate of reaction 3 most enzymes are heat liable sensitive 4 their presence does not alter the nature or properties of the end products of any reaction 5 enzymes are highly specific to the substrate substrate specific 6 most enzyme catalyzed reactions are reversible 7 the rate of enzyme activity is affected by ph temperature and substrate concentrations 8 they are not being used up during the reaction 9 enzymes possess active sites where the reaction takes place 10 some enzymes need nonproteinous components to catalyse the reaction which are known as cofactors the mechanisms of enzyme action the reactant and enzyme acts on is referred to as the substrate the enzyme binds to its substrate forming enzymesubstrate complex while enzyme and substrate form their complex catalytic action of the enzyme converts the substrate to the product enzyme substrate enzymesubstrate complex enzyme product the reaction catalyzed by each enzyme is very specific the specificity of an enzyme results from its shape the substrate binds to a specific region of the enzyme this region is called the active site the active site is formed by only a few amino acids other amino acids are needed to maintain the shape of the enzyme molecule the shape of the active site is complementary to the shape of the specific substrate of the enzyme and hence important in the substrate specificity of the enzyme the shape of the active site of an enzyme is not always fully complementary to its substrate as enzymes are not rigid structures the interactions between substrate and active site may slightly change the shape of the active site so that the substrate and the active site become complementary to each other this is called induced fi t mechanism the tight fi t not only brings the substrate molecules and the active site close to each other but also ensures the correct orientation of the molecules to help the reaction to proceed and catalyzes the conversion of substrate to product thereafter the product departs from the active site of the enzyme the enzyme is then free to take another substrate molecule into its active site cofactors nonproteinuos components which are essential for the catalytic activities of certain enzymes are called cofactors these cofactors bind to the enzymes in two ways some tightly bind and remain permanently and others loosely bind temporarily loosely bound cofactors are reversible under certain circumstances organic cofactors are called coenzymes eg derivatives of vitamins eg nad fad and biotin inorganic cofactors eg zn2 fe2 cu2 factors affecting the rate of enzymatic reactions 1 temperature 2 ph 3 substrate concentration 4 enzyme concentration 5 inhibitors temperature increase in temperature increases molecular motion therefore the speed of the moving molecules of both enzymes as well as the substrate will be accelerated this will enhance the colliding probability for both enzyme active sites and substrate molecules more collision between the enzyme active sites and substrate molecules generate greater chances for the reaction to occur this can continue up to a certain point after which there is a rapid decline in enzyme activity this point is referred to as optimum temperature this may vary from organism to organism eg most of the human enzymes have optimum temperature around the body temperature 35c40c optimum temperature of bacteria in hot springs is about 70c when the temperature increases beyond the optimum temperature the hydrogen bonds ionic and other weak chemical bonds of enzyme active sites may be disrupted this will result a change in the shape of the active site of enzyme which will alter the complementary nature of the active site of enzyme molecules therefore the complementary binding of enzyme active sites and substrate molecules will be prevented the above event is called as denaturation of enzyme molecules therefore the rate of enzyme catalyzed reaction will start to decline when the temperature increases beyond the optimum temperature and stops completely at certain temperature although rate of collision will keep on increasing ph enzymes function most efficiently within a certain ph range despite maintaining temperature of the environment constant the narrow range of ph in which a particular enzyme catalyzed reaction takes place is named as the ph range the ph at which the highest rate of reaction occurs is the optimum ph of the enzyme the alteration in ph above or below the optimum ph may lead to decline in enzyme activity this is due to the alteration of chemical bonds involving in formation of enzyme substrate complex in most enzymes optimum ph range is 68 but there are exceptions pepsin works best at ph 2 and optimum ph for trypsin is 8 substrate concentration increasing substrate concentration increases the probability of collision between the enzyme and substrate molecules with correct orientation however the enzyme molecules will be saturated after a particular concentration and therefore there will not be any further increase in the rate of reaction enzyme inhibitors certain molecules or ions selectively bind permanently or temporarily to the enzyme molecules and prevent them from forming enzymesubstrate complex these substances are called inhibitors they are either binding reversibly with weak interactions or binding irreversibly through covalent bonds eg irreversible inhibitors toxins poisons reversible inhibitors drugs used against microbes competitive inhibitors most of these are reversible inhibitors these chemicals resemble the shape and nature of the substrate therefore they compete with the substrate selectively for the active site of certain enzymes as a result of the above the number of active sites available for the enzymes may decline and therefore reduces the rate of enzyme catalyzed reactions the above situation may be reversed by increasing the substrate concentration eg protease inhibitor of drugs against hivchange noncompetitive inhibitors these chemicals do not compete with substrate molecules they interrupt enzymatic reaction by binding to a part of the enzyme other than the active site this causes the enzyme molecule to change its shape in such a way that the active site becomes less effective for the formation of enzyme substrate complex regulation mechanism of enzymatic activity in cells allosteric regulation of enzymes in many cases the molecules that naturally regulate enzyme activity in a cell behave like reversible noncompetitive inhibitors regulatory molecules either activators or inhibitors bind to specific regulatory sites elsewhere other than the active site of the molecule via noncovalent interactions and affect the shape and function of the enzyme it may result in either inhibition or stimulation of an enzyme activity a allosteric activation and inhibition most enzymes regulated by allosteric regulation are made from two or more subunits each sub unit composed of a polypeptide chain with its own active site the entire complex oscillates between two different shapes one catalyzing active and other inactive in this two forms regulatory molecules bind to a regulatory site called allosteric site often located where subunits join when an activator binds with this regulatory site stabilizes the shape with functional active sites whereas the inhibitor binds with the regulatory site it stabilizes the inactive form of enzyme subunits of enzyme arranged in a way through which they transmit the signals quickly other subunits through the interaction of subunits even a single activator or inhibitor molecule that bind to one regulatory site will affect the active site of all sub units eg adp function as allosteric activator bind to the enzyme and stimulates the production of atp by catabolism if the supply of atp exceed demand catabolism shows down as atp bind to the same enzyme as inhibitor b cooperativity this is another type of allosteric activation binding of one substrate molecule can stimulate binding or activity at other active site thereby increase the catalytic activity eg hemoglobin not an enzyme is made up of four subunits each with an o2 binding site the binding of a one molecule of o2 to one binding site increases the affinity for o2 of the remaining binding site c feedback inhibition in feedback inhibition a metabolic pathway is stopped by the inhibitory binding of its end product of a process to an enzyme thereby limit the production of more end products than required and thus wasting chemical resources feedback inhibition feedback inhibition is an essential process regulates the end products produced in metabolism eg adp function as allosteric activator and stimulates the production of atp during the catabolism in case atp supply exceeds demand catabolism slows down as atp molecules function as allosteric inhibitor energy needed for all living processes is obtained directly from atp atp is mainly produced by a process call ed cellular respiration in living cells,metabolism is the sum of all biochemical reactions in living organisms comprising catabolic and anabolic processes catabolism breaks down complex molecules into simpler ones releasing energy exergonic anabolism synthesizes complex molecules from simple ones requiring energy endergonic atp adenosine triphosphate is the universal energy currency produced via three mechanisms photophosphorylation atp synthesis using solar energy in photosynthesis substratelevel phosphorylation direct atp production from metabolic reactions oxidative phosphorylation atp formation during cellular respiration in mitochondria enzymes biological catalysts that lower activation energy regulate metabolic reactions they exhibit specificity for substrates and are influenced by factors like temperature ph and concentration enzyme inhibitors can decrease activity with two main types competitive inhibitors compete with substrates for active sites noncompetitive inhibitors bind elsewhere altering enzyme shape regulation occurs through allosteric mechanisms feedback inhibition and cooperativity ensuring metabolic efficiency
photosynthesis photosynthesis is a metabolic process by which light energy is trapped and converted to chemical energy chemical energy is stored in chemical bonds of carbohydrates fats oils and proteins all life on earth depends on photosynthesis either directly or indirectly photosynthesis also occurs in algae and certain prokaryotes global importance of photosynthesis all life on earth depends on photosynthesis directly or indirectly fulfill both carbon and energy requirements of organisms provide o 2 for respiration of aerobic organisms maintain o 2 and co2 balance in the atmosphere production of fossil fuel maintenance of global temperature during photosynthesis co2is reduced by the h of h2o and simple sugars are made using light energy in eukaryotic photosynthetic cells chloroplasts are the sites of photosynthesis process of photosynthesis consists of two main stages and they are integrated lightdependent reaction calvin cycle there are two types of photosynthetic mechanisms path ways based on the number of c atoms of the first stable product of the co2 fixation c 3 mechanism no of c atom of the first stable compound is three c 4 mechanism no of c atom of the first stable compound is four lightdependent reactions of photosynthesis take place in the membrane system of thylakoids they are flattened fluidfilled sacs which form stacks called grana at intervals chlorophylls carotenoids and electron acceptors are located on this membrane system of thylakoids stroma is a gel like structure containing soluble enzymes and other chemicals which is the site of the calvin cycle photosynthetic pigments are substances which absorb visible light in a leaf we see green colour because chlorophylls absorb violet blue and red light and therefore they transmit and reflect green colour different pigments absorb different wavelengths of light in chloroplast there are two types of chloroplast pigments such as chlorophylls and carotenoids chlorophyll a is the key light capturing pigment and they participate directly in the light reaction of photosynthesis according to the action spectrum chlorophyll a is more effective for blue and red light chlorophyll b and caraotenoids carotenes and xanthophylls are effective in absorption of specific range wavelengths of corresponding to different colours other important function of some carotenoids is photoprotection photoprotection is absorption and dissipation of excessive light energy if not that excessive light may cause damage to the chlorophylls or interact with oxygen and form reactive oxidative molecules which are dangerous to the cell absorption spectrum an absorption spectrum is a graph of the relative amounts of light absorbed at different wavelengths by a pigment action spectrum an action spectrum is a graph showing the effectiveness of different wave lengths of light in stimulating the photosynthesis excitation of chlorophyll by light when a molecule of chlorophyll or other photosynthetic pigment absorbs light it becomes excited the energy from the light is used to boost electrons to a higher level and become positively charged the excited state is unstable and returns to their original lower energy state the excited electrons may pass through several electron carriers until they reach the final electron acceptor chlorophyll chlorophyll e electron therefore chlorophyll is oxidized and electron acceptor is reduced photosystems chlorophyll molecules other organic molecules and proteins are organized into complexes in the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts they are called photosystems a photosystem contains a reaction centre complex and light harvesting complexes the reaction centre complex also contains a primary electron acceptor there are two types of photosystems found in the thylakoid membrane they are photosystem i ps i and photosystem ii ps iiin the ps i the chlorophyll a molecule is known as p700 since they absorb light at 700nm wave length effectively in the ps ii the reaction centre contains a chlorophyll a molecule which is known as p680 which absorbs light having a wavelength of 680 nm lightdependent reaction light reaction photosynthesis linear electron flow light is absorbed by the photosynthetic pigments and synthesize atp and nadph due to the excitation of photosystem i and photosystem ii which are embedded in the thylakoid membrane of chloroplast the key to this energy transformation is a flow of the electron in one direction through the photosystems and other molecular components built in the thylakoid this process is called linear electron flow the striking of photons of light on the pigments results in the excitation of electrons from the photosystem ii to the higher energy state these electrons will be accepted by the primary electron acceptor of photosystem ii splitting of water takes place as a result of an enzyme catalyzed reaction and yields o2 g h ions and electrons electrons released as a result of hydrolysis may neutralize excited photosystem ii p680 striking of photons of light on the pigments results in the excitation of electrons from photosystem i p700 to the higher energy state excited electrons will be accepted by a primary electron acceptor of psi excited electrons of ps ii at primary electron acceptor of ps ii will pass through an electron transport chain to ps i and neutralize the excited ps i the energy released due to the passage of electrons from higher energy state to lower energy result in the synthesis of atp this is known as photophosphorylation excited electrons of ps i at primary electron acceptor of psi will pass through an electron transport chain and reduce nadp and yield nadph the reduction of nadp is catalyzed by an enzyme called nadp reductase cyclic electron flow this occurs in photosystem i but not in photosystem ii here some photoexcited electrons uses alternative cyclic pathway this produces atp but not nadph and oxygen are released the calvin cycle the calvin cycle takes place in the stroma of the chloroplast energy from atp and nadph produced by the light reaction are used to reduce co2 the reactions are catalyzed by enzymes and their sequence was discovered by scientist calvin this is an anabolic reaction the first stable product of the calvin cycle is glyceraldehyde 3phosphate g3p for the net synthesis of one molecule of g3p the cycle must take place three times the calvin cycle of photosynthesis can be described in three steps carboxylation carbon fixation reduction regeneration of carbon dioxide acceptor carbon fi xation the co2 acceptor is a 5 c sugar ribulose bisphosphate rubp the addition of co 2 to a rubp is called carboxylation the enzyme involves in this reaction is rubp carboxylase oxygenase or rubisco the first product of rubp carboxylation is a 6c molecule which is unstable and breaks down immediately in to two molecules of 3phosphoglycerate 3pga this is the fi rst stable product of photosynthesis the enzyme rubp carboxylase oxygenase rubisco is present in large amounts in the chloroplast stroma reduction phase 13bisphosphoglycerate will be reduced to glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate g3p through step by step enzyme catalyzed reactions utilizing nadph and atp from light reaction g3p will act as a precursor for carbohydrate synthesis glucose regeneration of rubp rubp is regenerated by undergoing a series of complex reactions this process uses energy from atp generated in light reaction,photosynthesis is a vital metabolic process where light energy is converted into chemical energy stored in carbohydrates fats oils and proteins it occurs in chloroplasts of eukaryotic cells and involves two main stages lightdependent reactions and the calvin cycle key components include lightdependent reactions these occur in thylakoid membranes producing atp and nadph through linear and cyclic electron flow calvin cycle takes place in the stroma where carbon dioxide co2 is fixed into a stable 3carbon compound glyceraldehyde 3phosphate g3p using energy from atp and nadph photosystems complexes of chlorophyll and proteins in thylakoids specifically photosystem i p700 and photosystem ii p680 play crucial roles in capturing light energy key terms carboxylation the addition of co2 to ribulose bisphosphate rubp catalyzed by rubisco photophosphorylation the synthesis of atp during light reactions photosynthesis is essential for providing oxygen maintaining atmospheric balance and supporting life on earth
as its name suggests rubisco is capable of catalyzing two distinct reactions acting as both a carboxylase and as an oxygenase in the oxygenase reaction of rubisco uses the same substrate rubp but reacts it with o 2 the reaction is catalyzed on the same active site as the carboxylation reaction thus co 2 and o2 are competitive substrates therefore co2 inhibits the oxygenase and o 2 inhibits the carboxylase reaction the oxygenase reaction forms just one molecule of 3pga plus a twocarbon product 2phosphoglycolate which is of no immediate use in the calvin cycle and in higher concentrations it is toxic for the plant it therefore has to be processed in a metabolic pathway called photorespiration the photorespiratory pathway involves enzymes in the chloroplasts peroxisome and mitochondria detail of this pathway is not expected photorespiration is not only energy demanding but furthermore leads to a net loss of co 2 each time rubisco reacts with o2 instead of co2 the plants makes 50 less 3pga than it would have done if co 2 had been used this potentially eliminates the net gain in photosynthetic carbon and loose the productivity these two factors result in an increase in photorespiration relative to photosynthesis so that an increasing proportion of carbon is lost as the temperature rises the co 2 required for photosynthesis enters a leaf via stomata however stomata are also the main avenues of transpiration on a hot dry day most plants close their stomata in order to conserves water at the same time o 2 released from the light reactions begins to increase and this leads to further reduction of co2 to o2 ratio in the cytosol these conditions within the leaf favor a wasteful process photorespiration under high temperature dryness and high light intensities therefore plants developed different way to cope with this situation during the evolution that resulted a most successful solution to concentrate co 2 around rubisco provided by c4 photosynthetic pathway the establishment of c4 photosynthetic pathway includes several biochemical and anatomical modifications that allow plants with this pathway to concentrate co2 at the site of rubisco thereby its oxygenase reaction and the following photorespiration are largely repressed in c4 plants in most c4 plants the co2 concentration mechanism is achieved by a division of labor between two distinct specialized leaf cell types the mesophyll and the bundle sheath cells compared to c3 plants the bundle sheath cells of c4 plants have expanded physiological functions this is reflected by the enlargement and higher organelle content of these cells in c4 species for the efficient function of the c4 pathway a close contact between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells are tightly interconnected to each other by high numbers of plasmodesmata the bundle sheath cells enclose the vascular bundles and are themselves surrounded by the mesophyll cells and this type of leaf anatomy was termed kranz anatomy since rubisco can operate under high co2 concentrations in the bundle sheath cells it works more efficiently than in c3 plants because of the co2 concentration mechanism they can acquire enough co2 even when keeping their stomata more closed and minimize the water loss by transpiration c4 pathway of photosynthesis in the mesophyll cells of c4 plants co2 is converted to bicarbonate by carbonic anhydrase and initially fixed by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase using pep as co2 acceptor the resulting oxaloacetate oaa is composed of four carbon atoms which is the basis for the name of this metabolic pathway oxaloacetate is rapidly converted to the more stable c4 acids malate or aspartate that diffuse to the bundle sheath cells here co2 is released by decarboxylating enzymes and the released co2 is refixed by rubisco which exclusively operates in the bundle sheath cells in c4 plants chloroplasts found in mesophyll cells are different in anatomy in comparison to chloroplasts of bundle sheath cells since chloroplasts of mesophyll cells carryout only light reaction they are rich in grana the grana of mesophyll chloroplasts are large and highly differentiated for light reaction bundle sheath chloroplasts possess a very few less differentiated grana or grana are absent moreover that psii in the bundle sheath cells are depleted in order to lower oxygen production in these cells this pep carboxylase enzyme is much more efficient than the enzyme of rubp carboxylase for two reasons 1 it reacts with bicarbonate hco3 rather than with co2 the advantage of this is that there is a 50fold higher concentration of hco3 than co2 in solution in the cytosol 2 it has no affinity for o2 significance of the c4 pathway helps plants to improve the efficiency of co2 fixation at lower co2concentrations by preventing the gateways for photorespiration by spatially separating rubisco in hotdry climate it is essential for the stomata to close to prevent water loss through transpiration this reduces co2 intake of particular plants therefore plants in tropical zones or hot climate may suffer from co2 deficiency at lower co2 concentrations c4 mechanism increases the efficiency of photosynthesis by concentrating co2 in the bundle sheath cells c4 plants exhibit better wateruse efficiency than c3 plants because of the co2 concentration mechanism they can acquire enough co2 even when keeping their stomata more closed thus water loss by transpiration is reduced since rubisco can operate under high co2 concentrations in the bundle sheath cells it woks more efficiently than in c3 plants consequently c4 plants need less of this enzyme this leads to a better nitrogenuse efficiency of c4 compared to c3 plants comparisons of c3 and c4 plants c3 plants such as wheat rice and barley have an optimum temperature for photosynthesis between 1525c in these plants co fixation occurs only once with the co acceptor being a 5carbon compound called rubp the enzyme responsible for fixing co is rubisco which produces a 3carbon compound 3phosphoglycerate 3pga as the first product the leaf anatomy in c3 plants involves mesophyll cells where photosynthesis occurs with nongreen bundle sheath cells c3 plants typically have lower productivity c4 plants including maize sugarcane and grasses thrive in higher temperatures with photosynthesis being 50 more efficient at 35c co fixation occurs twice first in the mesophyll cells and then in the bundle sheath cells the initial co acceptor is a 3carbon compound pep in the mesophyll cells and rubp in the bundle sheath cells pep carboxylase an efficient enzyme fixes co in the mesophyll while rubisco operates efficiently under high co concentrations in the bundle sheath cells the first product of co fixation in c4 plants is a 4carbon acid oxaloacetate oaa c4 plants have kranz anatomy where photosynthesis occurs in both mesophyll and bundle sheath cells they are generally more productive yielding higher outputs than c3 plants factors affecting photosynthesis the rate of photosynthesis is an important factor in crop production rate is affected by various factors eg light intensity co2 concentration temperature water pollutants and inhibitors the photosynthesis involves a series of reactions therefore various factors are involved in it blackman who is the scientist first proposed the idea of principal of limiting factors when a chemical process is affected by more than one factor its rate is limited by the factor which is nearest its minimum value eg light intensity light intensity the rate of photosynthesis increases linearly with increasing light intensity gradually the rate of increase falls off as the other factors become limiting very high light intensities chlorophyll may bleach and slow down photosynthesis however plants exposed to such conditions are usually protected by devices such as thick cuticles hairy leaves under normal conditions co2 is the major limiting factor in photosynthesis increase in photosynthetic rate is achieved by increasing co2 concentration for example some greenhouse crops such as tomatoes are grown in co2 enriched atmosphere,rubisco an enzyme in photosynthesis catalyzes two reactions carboxylation using co and oxygenation using o the oxygenase reaction produces 3pga and 2phosphoglycolate the latter being toxic and processed via photorespiration leading to a net loss of co and decreased photosynthetic efficiency especially under high temperatures to counteract this c4 plants evolved a mechanism to concentrate co around rubisco reducing photorespiration this process involves two cell types mesophyll and bundle sheath cells which feature kranz anatomy in mesophyll cells co is fixed as oxaloacetate oaa before being transported to bundle sheath cells for refixation by rubisco c4 plants like maize and sugarcane are more efficient in hot dry conditions demonstrating better wateruse and nitrogenuse efficiency compared to c3 plants which include wheat and rice the rate of photosynthesis is influenced by factors such as light intensity and co concentration with light intensity initially increasing photosynthetic rates until other factors limit growth
cellular respiration is the process by which chemical energy in organic molecules such as carbohydrates is released by stepwise oxidative process catalyzed by enzymes and made available in living cells in the form of atp cellular respiration is divided as a aerobic respiration b anaerobic respiration aerobic respiration the process of synthesize atp from the respiratory substrates such as glucose in the presence of molecular oxygen o2 known as aerobic respiration glucose is found to be the major respiratory substrate in living cells the aerobic respiration of glucose molecules can be represented by the following balanced chemical equation c 6h12o6 6o2g 6co2g 6h2o energy atp heat this process consist three main steps they are a glycolysis b pyruvate oxidation and citric acid cycle krebs cycle c oxidative phosphorylation electron transport chain glycolysis it takes place in the cytosol of the cell because all enzymes that catalyze reactions of the glycolysis are found in the cytosol of the cell this process does not depend on o2 during the above process a six carbon 6c glucose molecule is broken down step by step into two threecarbon 3c pyruvate molecules two atp molecules are used up to initiate the process four hydrogen molecules and electrons released from glucose breakdown reduce two nad and produce two nadh at the end of glycolysis there will be four atp molecules produced since two atp molecules were used up for the initiative step the net yield will be two atp molecules only when o2 is present the pyruvate molecules will enter the mitochondria and further steps will take place oxidation of pyruvate link reaction these two pyruvate molecules enter mitochondrion by active transport through the membrane in the matrix of mitochondria pyruvate is converted to acetyl group by releasing two co2 molecules then this acetyl group combines with coenzyme a to produce acetyl coa in this reaction two nad is converted to two nadh molecules therefore this step can be represented as follows 2c 3h4o3 2coa 2nad 2 acetyl coa 2co2 2 nadh oxidation of pyruvate is a linking reaction of glycolysis and citric acid cycle acetyl coa will feed its acetyl group for citric acid cycle citric acid cycle this takes place in the matrix of mitochondria using specific enzymes as the fi rst product of this cyclic pathway is citric acid it is known as citric acid cycle the pathway was discovered by a germanbritish scientist hans krebs hence it is named as krebs cycle citric acid contains three carboxylic acid groups this cycle is also known as tricarboxylic acid cycle or tca cycle in the citric acid cycle 4 c compound oxalo acetate combines with 2 c compound acetyl co a to form 6 c compound citric acid then citric acid undergoes a series of reactions to regenerate oxaloacetate by releasing two co 2 molecules by decarboxylation reaction one atp molecule is produced by substrate level phosphorylation one fadh2 and three nadh will be generated as a result of oxidation reactions these are the products of a single acetyl group led into citric acid cycle and hence these numbers should double when the yield for a glucose molecule is considered electron transport chain this step is taken place across the inner membrane cristae of mitochondria the folding of cristae increases surface area for oxidative phosphorylation nadh and fadh 2 products in the early stages of aerobic respiration are oxidized by transferring electrons through the electron transport chain and finally to molecular oxygen o2 the electron transport chain is located in the inner membrane of mitochondrion and composed of series of protein and nonprotein molecules involving in the movement of electrons and protons across cristae therefore the molecular oxygeno2is the final electron acceptor in aerobic respiration in the electron transport chain atp is synthesized by oxidative phosphorylation in this electron transport chain energy is released progressively from nadh and fadh 2 and that energy is used to synthesize atp when one molecule of nadh is oxidized in the electron transport chain 25 molecules of atp in average are generated due to oxidative phosphorylation when one molecule of fadh2 is oxidized 15 molecules of atp in average are produced due to oxidative phosphorylation total number of atp that is produced in this step is 28 this is true in the active cells such as liver cells and cardiac muscle cells but not in other cells where two atp produced in glycolysis is used to transport 2nadh from cytosol to mitochondrial matrix in those cells total number of atp produced by one molecule of glucose is 322 30 atp total number of atp molecules produced from one molecule of glucose during aerobic respiration anaerobic respiration anaerobic respiration is breaking down of glucose in the absence of molecular oxygen which is regulated by enzymes of the cells occurring in cytosol in the absence of molecular oxygen pyruvate molecules cannot be broken down further atp generated is utilized to fulfill energy requirements however nadh produced during glycolysis cannot be utilized therefore since nad is limited it is essential for the cell to recycle nadh to enhance the availability of nad other than anaerobic respiration fermentation is a method of production of atp in the absence of o2 there are many types of fermentation differing from end products formed by pyruvate the two common types are 1 ethyl alcohol fermentation 2 lactic acid fermentation ethyl alcohol fermentation like in aerobic respiration the first step of this is also glycolysis therefore one molecule of glucose is converted to 2 molecules of pyruvate giving 2 molecules of atp and two molecules of nadh then this pyruvate involve in two steps in the 1st step pyruvate is converted in to acetyldehyde releasing a molecule of co2 in the second step acetyldehyde is reduced to ethanol using nadh that is produced in glycolysis therefore final hydrogen acceptor in ethyl alcohol fermentation is acetylaldehyde organic compound many bacteria carry out ethyl alcohol fermentation the most common organism which carries out ethyl alcohol fermentation is yeast lactic acid fermentation as in ethyl alcohol fermentation glycolysis takes place as the first step of lactic acid fermentation therefore one molecule of glucose produces two molecules of pyruvate two molecules of atp and two molecules of nadh then pyruvate is reduced directly by nadh for lactic acid as an end product with no release of co 2 therefore final h acceptor is also organic compounds certain fungi and bacteria carryout lactic acid fermentation but the most common organisms are lactic acid bacteria involved in formation of yoghurt and curd respiratory quotient it is the ratio of co 2 evolved and the volume of o2 consumed in a given time for the respiratory substrate rq v co2 vo2 rq of respiration of carbohydrates fats and proteins are 10 07 and 08 respectively,cellular respiration is the biochemical process by which cells convert organic molecules primarily glucose into atp adenosine triphosphate energy it occurs in two main types aerobic respiration occurs in the presence of oxygen involves three main stages glycolysis converts glucose into two pyruvate molecules yielding 2 atp and 2 nadh link reaction pyruvate is converted into acetyl coa producing 2 nadh citric acid cycle krebs cycle acetyl coa enters producing atp nadh and fadh2 electron transport chain uses nadh and fadh2 to generate up to 30 atp via oxidative phosphorylation anaerobic respiration occurs without oxygen leading to fermentation types include ethanol fermentation produces ethanol and co2 lactic acid fermentation produces lactic acid without co2 the respiratory quotient rq is defined as the ratio of co2 produced to o2 consumed indicating the type of substrate being metabolized
origin of life on earth condition of earth before life earth and the other planets of the solar system were formed about 46 billion years ago at the beginning of the solar system planet earth was being bombarded by chunks of rocks and ice the first atmosphere was probably thick with water vapour along with various compounds released by volcanic eruptions including nitrogen and its oxides carbon dioxide methane ammonia hydrogen and hydrogen sulphide the neutral atmosphere then turned to be a reducing one the first atmosphere had little oxygen later earth was cooled down and the water vapour condensed into the ocean some of the hydrogen quickly escaped into the space volcanic eruptions lightening extreme uv radiation hydro thermal vents and alkaline vents along with the earths reducing atmosphere favored the synthesis of organic molecules essential for the origin of life these simple organic molecules then polymerized to form macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids further the formation of selfreplicating organic molecules made life possible on earth evolution of biological diversity 1 biochemical evolution direct evidence for life on early earth comes from fossils of microorganisms that are about 35 billion years old observations and experiments in chemistry geology and physics have provided evidence for the appearance of the first living cells the theory of the biochemical evolution arouse from the hypothesis based on chemical and physical processes on early earth the emerging force of natural selection could have produced the first cells through a sequence of four main stages 1 atmospheric conditions of early earth facilitated the abiotic synthesis of small organic molecules such as amino acids and nitrogenous bases from inorganic molecules 2 polymerization of the above small organic molecules leads to the formation of organic macromolecules a amino acids proteins b nbase sugar phosphate nucleic acids 3 organic macromolecules were packed into membranes to produce protocells 4 nucleic acids gained self replicating capability which made inheritance possible for the cells 2 origin of protocell haldane suggested that the early oceans were a solution of organic molecules primitive soup in which life arose recent studies related to the volcanicatmosphere and alkaline vents show the abiotic synthesis of organic molecules another source of organic molecules may have been meteorites rna accumulated into lipid bound vesicles and formed protocells which exhibited enzyme catalyzed activities and were able to grow replicate and evolve the early genes and enzymes would have been rna which enabled replication of rna other molecules that were in the primitive soup were also collected in the protocell growth occurred by addition of lipids to the membrane by collision of micelles when the protocell becomes too large it divided to form two protocells with rna included 3 origin of photosynthetic organisms fossils of the first photosynthetic organism todays cyanobacteria originated before 27 billion years ago as a result of photosynthesis iron fe 2 ion were oxidized once all of the dissolved iron has precipitated additional o2 dissolved in the water until the water bodies became saturated with o 2 the increase of photosynthetic bacteria contributed to the increment of the amount of atmospheric oxygen which had accelerated the origin of chloroplast 4 the origin of first eukaryote the fossils of the first eukaryotic organisms were estimated as from about 18 billion years ago these eukaryotic single cellular organisms later evolved in to multicellular organisms the appearance of structurally complex eukaryotic cells sparked the evolution of greater morphological diversity than was possible for the simple prokaryotic cells after the first eukaryotes appeared a great range of unicellular forms evolved it gave rise to diversity of some singlecelled eukaryotes which evolved in to multicellular forms such as the varieties of algae plants fungi and animals fossils of the oldest known protists similar to small red algae were dated as 12 billion years ago 5 diversifi cation of eukaryotes many present day animal phyla appeared in the early cambrian period several animal groups which include porifera sponges cnidarians sea anemones and their relatives and molluscs appeared in the late proterozoic

when animals started to depend on algae or plants as consumers and with the arrival of many groups of animals functioning food webs began to appear colonization of land by fungi plants and animals

evolution can be defined as a change in the genetic composition of a population from generation to generation descent with modification over a long period of time this may take millions of years theories of evolution are theory of lamarck darwin wallace theory theory of natural selection neo darwinism theory of lamarck lamarck published his hypothesis in 1809 he explained his hypothesis using two principles 1 use and disuse 2 inheritance of acquired characteristics 1 use and disuse the parts of the body that are used extensively become larger and stronger if not used they deteriorate eg giraffe stretching its neck to reach leaves on higher branches 2 inheritance of acquired characteristics organism acquired adaptation during their life time according to the needs of enviro off spring is better adapted to live in that environment eg long muscular neck of the giraffe had evolved over many generations as giraffes stretch their necks even higher darwin wallace theory theory of natural selection darwin observed two phenomena from the environment his observations were the populations of a species vary in characteristics among their inheritance traits each species produces more offspring than their environment could accommodate the above observations were interpreted by charles darwin as certain traits of a population which are capable of exhibiting qualities for better surviveal and their reproduction can produce more offspring variation in abilities for survival and production among a population may enhance the abundance of favorable characteristics in that population some favorable characteristics for survival and reproduction are escaping from predators defense tolerating physical conditions stress conditions obtaining food resistance against disease fertilizing probability number of offspring produced process of natural selection over production variation competition and survival of the fi ttest natural selection of favourable traits neodarwinism neodarwinism generally denotes the integration of charles darwins theory of natural selection mendelian genetics as the basis for biological inheritance and knowledge of population genetics,evolution is defined as a change in the genetic composition of a population over generations often taking millions of years key theories of evolution include lamarcks theory proposed in 1809 it consists of two principles use and disuse body parts used extensively become stronger while unused parts deteriorate eg giraffes stretching their necks inheritance of acquired characteristics adaptations developed during an organisms lifetime are passed to offspring darwinwallace theory natural selection observations noted that populations have variation in traits species produce more offspring than can survive favorable traits enhance survival and reproduction the process of natural selection involves overproduction variation competition and survival of the fittest natural selection of favorable traits neodarwinism integrates darwins natural selection with mendelian genetics explaining inheritance through population genetics
methods of artificial and natural classification arrangement of organisms into groups on the basis of the common characteristics is called classification taxonomy is the scientific study on classification identification nomenclature and description this includes placing groups of organisms in a hierarchical sequence two methods of classification 1 artificial classification grouping is based on a few pre selected unifying characters the characters are selected first according to convenience and organisms are grouped based on the selected criteria evolutionary relationships are ignored only system used before 18th century easy to use easy to expand by adding more groups eg plants can be classified as cereals ornamental plants medicinal plants poisonous plants etc animals can be classified as two legged four legged six legged eight legged etc 2 natural classification grouping based on true relationships represents evolutionary relationships based on phylogeny evolutionary history of a species or groups of species systems developed after then study of evolution based on many characteristics characteristics used can be morphological anatomical cytological or molecular biological such as dna and rna base sequences eg plants can be classified into phyla bryophyta lycophyta pterophyta cycadophyta coniferophyta and anthophyta etc animals can be classifi ed into cnidaria platyhelminthes etc history of classification the early classification systems were all artificial systems and were mostly based on human uses aristotle was the first to classify organisms scientifically he divided organisms into plants and animals animals were further classified according to criteria such as mode of locomotion reproduction and presence or absence of red blood cells aristotles pupil theophrastus classified plants according to habit eg trees shrubs and herbs and according to lifespan eg annuals biennials and perennials up to the time of linnaeus scientists have used many different methods for naming of organisms carolus linnaeus1753 swedish botanist introduced binomial nomenclature and also classified about 6000 plants into a hierarchical order of taxa classification level such as species genus order and class his classification of flowering plants was based on the number of stamens and styles of flower he identified two kingdoms of organisms plants and animals with the discovery of the microorganisms the scientists understood that there were organisms which could not be assigned into either plants or animals to get over this difficulty ernest haeckel 1866 introduced a third kingdom protista he also introduced the taxon phylum and classified many organisms with the discovery of the electron microscope biologists identified prokaryotic and eukaryotic cellular organization robert h whittaker 1969 introduced the five kingdom system of biological classification monera protista fungi plantae and animalia his classification was based on the nature of cellular organization unicellular or multicellular and mode of nutrition with the acceptance of darwins theory of the evolution and unitary origin of life taxonomists began to use natural systems with interpreting evolutionary relationships with the recent advancement of molecular biology and the use of molecular methods in studying evolutionary relationships it became apparent that in the very early evolution some prokaryotes differ as much from each other as do from eukaryotes such difficulties have lead biologists to adopt three domain system of classification the three domains are bacteria archea and eukarya which are taxonomic ranks higher than the kingdom carl woese 1977 introduced this three domain system in this tree of life the first major split in the history of life occurred when bacteria diverged from others eukarya and archea are mostly related to each other than bacteria present system of classification and its basis the present system of classification is mainly based on the rapid advance of molecular biology and the new information on the evolutionary relationships of organisms the sequence of bases of dna of important genes the sequences of bases of dna of mitochondria and chloroplasts the base sequence of ribosomal rna the sequence of amino acids in common proteins the molecular structure of cellular components are used as important taxonomic criteria in modern systematics however the kingdom protista is not a natural group it is an artificial group including organisms which have different evolutionary origins viruses do not have cellular organization and therefore do not belong to any of the kingdoms they are also an artificial group considered separately hierarchy of taxa from domains to species the taxonomic unit at any level rank of the hierarchy is called a taxon pluraltaxa each taxon has a rank and a name eg panthera is a taxon at the genus level rank mammalia is a taxon at the class level rank under the hierarchical system there are levels ranks of taxa each domain is divided into kingdoms a kingdom is divided into phyla singular phylum phylum into classes etc many of these categories may also be subdivided eg super class subfamily subspecies etc from domain to species the number of shared characteristics among the members in the taxa increases from species to domain the number of individuals in the taxon increases,classification arranges organisms into groups based on common characteristics and taxonomy is the scientific study of this process there are two main classification methods artificial classification groups organisms based on a few selected traits ignoring evolutionary relationships examples include categorizing plants as cereals or ornamental plants natural classification groups organisms based on true evolutionary relationships phylogeny incorporates multiple characteristics such as morphological and molecular traits historical context aristotle pioneered scientific classification dividing organisms into plants and animals linnaeus introduced binomial nomenclature and a hierarchical system haeckel added a third kingdom protista while whittaker proposed a fivekingdom system based on cellular organization and nutrition modern classification now based on molecular biology and evolutionary relationships leading to the threedomain system proposed by woese bacteria archaea and eukarya the present system relies on dna and rna sequences as key taxonomic criteria
species is a group of organisms who shares similar characteristics and has the ability to interbreed and produce viable and fertile offspring other definitions of species morphological species concept use of morphological criteria to distinguish species such as body shape and other structural features ecological species conceptdefines species in terms of its ecological niche and the sum of how members of the species interact with the non living and the living components of their environment phylogenetic species concept defines the species as the smallest group of individuals that share a common ancestor binomial nomenclature in classification use of common names for organisms causes confusion more over some common names do not actually reflect the kind of organism they signify eg jelly fish a cnidarian cray fish a crustacian silver fish an insect star fish an echinoderm further a given organism has different names in different languages carolous linnaeus 17071778 proposed a binomial system of nomenclature of species which was accepted worldwide to avoid ambiguity according to the binomial nomenclature the name of an organism has two parts first is the generic name to which the species belongs and the second is a specific epithet the unique for each species within the genus generic name is usually a noun and the specific epithet an adjective describing a particular feature eg homo sapiens homo means man sapiens means intelligent related species have the same generic name with different specific epithets eg dipterocarpus zeylanicus and dipterocarpus grandiflorus dipterocarpus zeylanicus means fruit with two wings and endemic to sri lanka dipterocarpus grandiflorus means fruit with two wings and having large flowers international codes of binominal nomenclature biologists have adopted sets of rules or codes of nomenclature these codes are slightly different for plants animals bacteria and viruses some of the important rules for naming plants fungi bacteria and animals are as follows two species of organisms cannot have the same name each species has a generic name and a specific epithet both together forming the species name or scientific name the name should be made up of latinized words written in the roman script it should be underlined when hand written and italicized when printed the first letter of the generic name must be capitalized the and specific epithet must be in simple letters in scientific writing the name of the author who gave the name is indicated by a capital letter an abbreviation or full word at the end of the name which is not latinized eg cocos nucifera l l for linnaeus a third word can be used to represent a subspecies or a variety example panthera parduskotiya sri lankan leopard use of keys used to group organisms and identify them keys do not show the evolutionary relationships the commonly used key is the dichotomous key some examples are given below domains there are three domains they are a domain bacteria consists of one kingdom kingdom bacteria b domain archaeaconsists of one kingdom kingdom archaebacteria c domain eukaryaconsists of four kingdoms kingdom protista kingdom fungi kingdom plantae kingdom animalia the diversity of organisms within the domain bacteria key characteristics of domain bacteria they are prokaryotic they are unicellular colonial filamentous most of them are found in size between 05 to 5m well adapted to most of the normal habitats both land and water most of them contain peptidoglycan in their cell walls according to the amount of peptidoglycan present in the cell wall they are classified as gram positive and gram negative bacteria most of their cell walls are surrounded by a sticky layer of polysaccharides or proteins called capsule most of them have flagella for motility bacterial flagellum differs from eukaryotic flagellum as they are not covered by a plasma membrane and absence of 92 structure of microtubules possess diverse nutritional modesautotrophs heterotrophs posses diverse metabolic modes obligate aerobes obligate anaerobes facultative anaerobes etc some are capable of performing nitrogen fixation eg rhizobium sp some cyanobacteria rapid reproduction by binary fission some perform conjugation as a sexual method certain bacteria use bacterial chlorophyll as a photosynthetic pigment key characteristics of cyanobacteria prokaryotic organisms photosynthetic most are unicellular and oxygen generating and solitary but some are linked to form fi laments or colonies sheathed in mucous some have the ability of fixing atmospheric nitrogen key characteristics of domain archaea they are prokaryotic and unicellular they lack peptidoglycan in their cell walls which are made up of proteins and polysaccharides the size of most of them is between 055 m they include extreme halophiles and extreme thermophiles some archaeabacteria live in more moderate environmentsmethanogens other species inhabits the anaerobic guts of cattle termites and other herbivores key characteristics of domain eukarya they are eukaryotic vary in size most of them are multicellular habitats are diverse diverse in nutrition mostly aerobes most of them exhibit sexual reproduction some protists are only known to reproduce asexually a comparison of the three domains of life bacteria are prokaryotic organisms with cell walls composed of peptidoglycan their membrane lipids contain unbranched hydrocarbons bacteria do not have histones associated with dna and their chromosomes are circular introns are rare in bacterial genes bacterial rna polymerase exists in one form and protein synthesis begins with the amino acid formylmethionine their growth is inhibited by antibiotics like streptomycin and chloramphenicol and they do not thrive at temperatures above 100c bacteria inhabit diverse environments and examples include escherichia coli salmonella typhi and cyanobacteria like nostoc and anabaena archaea are also prokaryotic but lack peptidoglycan in their cell walls which are instead made of proteins and polysaccharides some of their membrane lipids contain branched hydrocarbons archaea have histones associated with dna in some species and their chromosomes are circular introns are present in some archaeal genes they possess several kinds of rna polymerase and methionine is the initiator amino acid for protein synthesis unlike bacteria archaea do not have their growth inhibited by antibiotics like streptomycin and chloramphenicol and some species can grow at temperatures above 100c archaea often live in extreme environments like volcanic pits and hot springs examples include methanococcus and thermococcus eukarya are eukaryotic organisms meaning their cells have a true nucleus and organelles their cell walls if present are composed of cellulose hemicellulose pectin and chitin like bacteria their membrane lipids contain unbranched hydrocarbons histones are associated with dna and their chromosomes are linear rather than circular introns are present in many eukaryotic genes eukaryotes have several kinds of rna polymerase and protein synthesis begins with methionine growth in eukaryotes is not inhibited by antibiotics like streptomycin and chloramphenicol and they do not grow at temperatures above 100c eukaryotes inhabit diverse environments with examples including protists fungi plants and animals,the concept of species refers to a group of organisms that share similar characteristics and can interbreed to produce viable offspring different definitions of species include morphological species concept distinguishes species based on physical traits ecological species concept defines species by their ecological niche and interactions within their environment phylogenetic species concept groups individuals that share a common ancestor binomial nomenclature proposed by carolus linnaeus assigns each species a twopart latin name consisting of a generic name and a specific epithet to avoid confusion for example homo sapiens identifies humans there are three domains of life bacteria prokaryotic unicellular organisms with peptidoglycan cell walls examples include escherichia coli and cyanobacteria archaea prokaryotic unicellular organisms that lack peptidoglycan and can thrive in extreme environments examples include methanococcus eukarya eukaryotic organisms with complex cells they can be multicellular or unicellular and include protists fungi plants and animals
key characteristics of kingdom protista most of them are unicellular although there are some colonial and multi cellular species it is a polyphyletic group originated from more than one ancestor and an artificial group in classification found in freshwater marine and damp soil some are symbionts unicellular colonial or multicellular some are photoautotrophs some are heterotrophs and some are mixotrophs combination of photoautotrophic and heterotrophic nutrition euglena unicellular lack cell wall and pellicle present chloroplasts are present they have one or two flagella they have eye spot contractile vacuole is present they have a pocket at one end of the cell from which one or two flagella emerged paramecium habitat is freshwater lack cell wall but pellicle is present unicellular cilia may completely cover the cell surface they have two types of nuclei mega nucleus and micronucleus contractile and food vacuoles are present oral groove is present amoeba aquatic marine and freshwater forms are free living others are parasitic lack cell walls unicellular organisms they form pseudopodia which are used to locomote and feed they do not have definite shape food vacuoles are present ulva macroscopic marine forms cell wall present multicellular thallus differentiated into leaf like blades and root like holdfast green in colour green algae gelidium marine cell walls present multicellular thallus with hold fast it is greenish red in colour red algae sargassum marine comparatively larger and complex thallus is plant like it consists of a root like holdfast stem like stipe and leaf like blade multi cellular thallus is supported by gas filled bulb shape floats appear in olive green or brown colour brown algae diatoms it is aquatic fresh water and marine unicellular having glass like wall consists of two parts that overlap presence of silica highly diverse group regarding the shape and markings in the surface golden brown in colour golden brown algae,kingdom protista is a diverse and polyphyletic group of mostly unicellular organisms although some are colonial or multicellular they thrive in various environments including freshwater marine and damp soil and can be symbiotic nutritionally protists can be categorized as photoautotrophs organisms that produce their own food through photosynthesis heterotrophs organisms that obtain food from other sources mixotrophs organisms that combine both nutritional modes key representatives include euglena unicellular with chloroplasts flagella and an eye spot they lack a cell wall paramecium unicellular covered with cilia possessing two types of nuclei and oral grooves amoeba unicellular and shapeless moving via pseudopodia and feeding through food vacuoles ulva multicellular green algae with differentiated structures gelidium multicellular red algae with a holdfast sargassum complex multicellular brown algae resembling plants diatoms unicellular aquatic algae with silicabased cell walls known for their diverse shapes
kingdom plantae evolutionary relationships among major groups of plants it is believed that members of the kingdom plantae were evolved from a group of chlorophytes green algae most of them are terrestrial organisms chlorophyte algae lack key traits of land plants walled spores produced in sporangia multicellular gametangia dependent embryo and apical meristem they evolved in the terrestrial environment plant groups can be distinguished based on the presence or absence of an extensive system of vascular tissue based on that there are two major groups of plants the can be seen they are vascular plants and nonvascular plants diversification of kingdom plantae nonvascular plants phylum bryophyta mosses pogonatum phylum hepatophyta marchantia phylum anthocerophyta anthoceros vascular seedless plants phylum lycophyta selaginella phylum pterophyta nephrolepis vascular seed plants gymnosperms phylum cycadophyta cycas sp phylum coniferophyta pinus phylum gnetophyta gnetum angiosperms phylum anthophyta all flowering plants nvascular plants one way to distinguish a group of plants is to see whether or not they have an extensive system of vascular tissue that transport water and nutrients throughout the lant body most present day plants do have a complex vascular tissue system and therefore are called vascular plants plants that do not have an extensive transport system are described as non vascular plants non vascular plants are informally named s bryophytes eg marchantia pogonatum antheroceros bryophytes share some derived traits with vascular plants but lack in many innovations f vascular plants such as presence of true stems roots and leaves diversity of bryophytes hylum hepatophyta eg marchantia liverworts hylum anthocerophyta eg anthoceros hornworts hylum bryophyta eg pogonatum mosses racteristic features of phylum bryophyta g pogonatum especially common in moist terrestrial places haploid gametophyte is dominant stage of the life cycle photosynthetic and independent gametophytes are differentiated into leaves stems and rhizoids they have no vascular tissues archegonia and antheridia are typically carries on separate female and male gametophyte therefore gametophyte is dioecious male plant produces flagellated sperm which can swim through a film of water for fertilization sporophytes are usually green and photosynthetic when young however they are not independent they attach to their parental gametophytes and absorb nutrients and water from the female gametophyte sporophytes have specialized pores called stomata which are also found in all vascular plants they are homosporous vascular plants cover about 93 of the existing plant species they can be further divided into two groups 1 seedless vascular plants 2 seed plants seedless vascular plants seedless vascular plants lack seeds and disperse by means of spores they are categorized into two groups 1 lycophytes 2 pterophytes even though both pterophytes and lycophytes are seedless plants pterophytes share a more recent common ancestor with seed plants fossils and living seedless vascular plants provide evidence for plant evolution during devonian and carboniferous periods the ancestors of vascular plants already have had some derived traits of modern vascular plants however they lack roots and some other adaptations fossils suggest that the ancestors of vascular plants had gametophyte and sporophytes that were about equal in size however among the living vascular plants sporophyte generation is large and more complex for example in ferns leafy plants are the sporophytes significant features of seedless vascular plants 1 transportation through xylem and phloem vascular plants have two types of vascular tissues xylem and phloem xylem consists of tracheids fibers and parenchyma cells conducts water and minerals cell walls of tracheids and fibers are strengthened by the polymer lignin these tissues permit plants to grow tall this may facilitate them to obtain a high amount of light for photosynthesis and ease the spore dispersal phloem this tissue has cells arranged in tubes they distribute sugars amino acids and other organic products among different parts of the plant 2 evolution of roots roots are organs that absorb water and nutrients from the soil they anchor the plants and allow the shoot system to grow taller they are to replace the rhizoids seen in bryophytes root tissues of living plants resemble stem tissues of the early vascular plants preserved in fossils 3 evolution of leaves there are two types of leaves they are microphylls and megaphylls microphylls are single veined and smaller in size while megaphylls are large flattened with branched veins leaves with branched vascular tissues increase the surface area for efficient photosynthesis megaphylls sporophylls and spore variations modified leaves that bear sporangia are known as sporophylls most seedless vascular plant species produce one type of sporangium and one type of spores therefore they are known as homosporous some plant species produce two types of sporangia and produce two kinds of spores called mega spores and microspores this condition is known as heterosporous mega spores develop into female gametophyte while microspores develop into male gametophyte phylum lycophyta lycophytes are terrestrial and some are epiphytes the dominant plant is sporophyte they produce upright stems and ground hugging stems in upright stems small leaves can be found ground hugging stems produce dichotomously branching roots they have strobili in many club mosses and spike mosses sporophylls are clustered into club shaped cones strobili they are homosporous or heterosporous spike mosses are usually relatively smaller and often grow horizontally all club mosses are homosporous eg lycopodium sp all spike mosses are heterosporous eg selaginella in some species the tiny gametophyte live above the ground and are photosynthetic others live below the ground and are nourished by symbiotic fungi phylum pterophyta most sporophytes have rhizome an underground stem at the tip of the rhizome they produce leaves called fronds many fronds are highly dissected and feathery all species are homosporous which develop into a bisexual gametophyte sporophytes are dominant eg nephrolepis seed plants vascular plants consist of seeds and are a called seed plants they represent the vast majority of living plant species seed plants can be divided into two groups based on the absence or presence of enclosed chambers in which seeds mature 1 gymnosperms 2 angiosperms gymnosperms are naked seed plants as their seeds are not enclosed in chambers angiosperms are seed plant group accommodating all flowering plants angiosperm seeds develop inside chambers called ovaries which originate within flowers and mature into fruits significant features of seed plants 1 production of seed a seed consists of an embryo and endosperm endosperms supply food to the embryo this endosperm is surrounded by a protective coat which is known as seed coat when seeds are mature they can be dispersed through various dispersal methods seeds are key adaptations that help seed plants to become the dominant producers on land and to exhibit the vast plant diversity of today 2 reduced gametophyte the evolutionary trend of gametophyte reduction continued further in the vascular plants and led to seed plants the gametophyte of seed vascular plants is not visible to the naked eye they are mostly microscopic tiny gametophytes develop from spores and are retained within the sporangia of sporophyte this arrangement protects the gametophyte from environmental stresses the moist reproductive tissues of the sporophyte shield the gametophyte from uv radiation and protect them from drying out this relationship also enables the dependent gametophyte to obtain nutrients from the sporophyte 3 heterospory seed plants are heterosporous produce both megaspores and microspores each megasporangium has a single functional megaspore and each microsporangium contains a large number of microspores 4 production of ovules and eggs seed plants are unique in retaining the megasporangium within a layer of sporophyte tissue called integument envelops megasporangium the entire structure containing megasporangium megaspore called an ovule inside each ovule female gametophyte develop and produces one or more eggs 5 production of pollen and sperms a microspore develops into pollen grain that consists of a male within the pollen wall the wall of the pollen is tough as it is m sporopollenin which protects the pollen grain during pollina pollen grain towards the ovule is called pollination when a poll rise to a pollen tube that discharges sperm male gametes into the located within the ovule inside a pollen grain a sperm producing male gametophyte is p seed plants do not require motility as they are carried directly in tubes some gymnosperms retain the ancient flagellated condition have been lost in the sperm of most gymnosperms and all angio hylum gnetophyta eg gnetum only gymnosperms have vessels in xylem leaves of gymnosperms look like those of the flowering plants their seeds look like fruits of angiosperms phylum cycadophyta they have palm like leaves and large cones they have flagellated sperms similar to those of seedless vascular plants eg cycas phylum coniferophyta eg pinus large trees are included such as cyperes and red woods in conifers two types of spores are produced by separate cones phylum anthophyta angiosperms presence of flowers stamens produce microspores and these microspores develop into pollen grains these pollen grains contain male gametophyte gametes carpels produce megaspores and these megaspores produce female gametophytes embryo sac seeds are enclosed within the carpels production of fruits seeds are protected by fruits which help in their dispersal this is one of the unique features of phylum anthophyta a fruit typically consists of a fertilized ovary and sometimes include other persistent floral parts after fertilization the ovary wall thickens and develops into fruit ovules develop as seed of the fruit thru fruit protects dormant seeds and aid in their dispersal diversity of angiosperms the flowering plants angiosperms are divided into two groups based mainly on the number of cotyledons in their embryo these two groups are 1 monocotyledons species with one cotyledons 2 dicotyledons species with two cotyledons monocotyledoneae or monocots are characterized by having embryos with a single cotyledon they typically possess a fibrous root system and have leaves with parallel veins the flower parts of monocots are usually trimerous meaning they come in multiples of three in monocot flowers the perianth is present without a distinct calyx and corolla additionally the pollen grains of monocots have a single opening aperture and their vascular bundles in the stem are scattered and lack cambia examples of monocots include grasses coconuts and rice dicotyledoneae or dicots feature embryos with two cotyledons they generally have a tap root system and exhibit reticulate netlike veins in their leaves the flower parts in dicots are often pentamerous or tetramerous occurring in multiples of five or four unlike monocots dicot flowers have a distinct calyx and corolla pollen grains in dicots possess three openings apertures and their vascular bundles in the stem are arranged in a ring and include cambia common examples of dicots are rose shoe flower and cucurbits,the kingdom plantae evolved from chlorophytes green algae and consists of two major groups vascular and nonvascular plants nonvascular plants or bryophytes eg mosses liverworts hornworts lack vascular tissues and are characterized by a dominant haploid gametophyte stage vascular plants which include seedless plants lycophytes and pterophytes and seed plants gymnosperms and angiosperms have complex vascular tissues xylem and phloem that transport water and nutrients seed plants with adaptations like seeds and reduced gametophytes can be divided into gymnosperms naked seeds and angiosperms enclosed seeds angiosperms are further categorized into monocots and dicots based on cotyledon number

the main focus of this unit is on structure growth and development of vascular plants plants consist of a root system and a shoot system and roots and shoots grow at their tips which are with meristematic properties and called as apices buds or meristems types of plant tissues structure function relationship a tissue is a group of one or more cell types which carries out specialized functions meristems locations and role in plant growth plants have undifferentiated tissues called meristems consisting of cells which constantly divide under suitable conditions and produce new cells some of these cells then elongate and differentiate to produce new tissues of the plant body and others remain as meristems meristems may have dormant periods due to the action of meristem new cells are added subsequently these cells get differentiated and therefore plant growth occurs by making new plant tissues characteristics of meristematic cells all cells in the meristems have common characteristics they are living cells are isodiametric roughly spherical are structurally and functionally undifferentiated have a central nucleus have a dense cytoplasm have ability to multiply in meristem there are three overlapping zones of cells consisting of cells at successive stages of cell division cell elongation and differentiation there are three types of meristems they are 1 apical meristems 2 lateral meristems 3 intercalary meristems apical meristems these meristems are located at root tips and shoot tips they add new cells that enable increase in length this process is known as primary growth lateral meristems vascular cambium and cork cambium are lateral meristems they are found in woody plants and involve in the secondary growth in increasing circumference of roots and stems the vascular cambium produces secondary xylem and secondary phloem the cork cambium produces thick and tough periderm replacing epidermis intercalary meristems some monocots such as grasses show meristematic activity at the bases of stems and leaves nodes these are known as intercalary meristems they allow rapid regrowth in damaged leaves primary growth of roots elongation of root due to the activity of primary meristems located on root apex is called primary growth of the root during the growth three processes take place i cell division due to mitotic division ii cell elongation iii cell maturation due to differentiation these stages are found in three overlapping regions starting from meristems the zone of cell division includes the root apical meristem and its derivatives in this region new cells are produced to both sides cells produced outward to the apical meristem are differentiated to form root cap which prevents damaging the root apical meristem from friction when grows through soil cells produced inward to the meristem undergo elongation in the zone of cell elongation root cells elongate sometimes to more than ten times their original length hence the root is pushed forward through soil in the zone of maturation the cells begin specializing in structure and function where cells complete their differentiation and become functionally mature primary structure of the root is formed as a result of primary growth primary growth of the shoot elongation of shoot is due to the activity of primary meristem located in shoot apex and is called primary growth of the shoot a shoot apical meristem is a domeshaped mass of dividing cells located at the shoot tip leaves develop from leaf primordia fingerlike projections along the sides of the apical meristems normally these primordia cover the shoot apical meristem shoot apical meristem produces new cells only towards the stem due to mitosis after cell elongation cell differentiation takes place then the primary tissues of the stem are formed due to cell differentiation therefore the height of the stem is increased due to primary growth differences between shoot apex and root apex the shoot apex is located at the tips of the shoots and is responsible for producing new cells that contribute to the growth of the shoot it is protected by leaf primordia which are the early stages of developing leaves the shoot apex produces new cells primarily inwards facilitating the elongation and development of the stem and leaves on the other hand the root apex is found at the tip of the root and is covered by a root cap which protects it as the root pushes through the soil the root apex produces new cells in both directions outward and inward contributing to the growth of both the root cap and the root itself this allows the root to expand and absorb nutrients efficiently plant tissue systems the new cells originating from the meristems are differentiated to perform specialized functions and form a plant tissue system during differentiation process they undergo changes in cytoplasm organelles and cell wall therefore several types of plant cells can be recognized according to their structure and function a tissue consists of group of one or more cell types which carries out specialized functions vascular plants have three main tissue systems they are 1 dermal tissue systems 2 ground tissue systems 3 vascular tissue systems dermal tissue system this is the outer protective covering of plants eg epidermis protective layer in the stems and roots of the primary plant body and leaves tightly packed single cell layer normally covered by a cuticle which is a waxy epidermal coating in aerial parts specialized cells such as guard cells trichomes and root hairs are also found in epidermis functions of epidermis defense against physical damage and pathogens cuticle helps to prevent water loss root hairs involve in absorption of water and mineral ions guard cells help gaseous exchange trichomes epidermal outgrowths such as hairs and glands o hair like trichomes reduce water loss shiny hairs reflect excess light o some trichomes secrete chemicals involved in defense against insects pathogens herbivores epidermis in older regions of stems and roots is replaced by a protective layer called periderm after the secondary growth ground tissue system ground tissue fills the gap between dermal tissue and vascular tissue mainly consists of cortex outer to vascular tissue and pith inner to vascular tissue the ground tissue includes cells specialized for functions such as storage photosynthesis support and short distance transport three main types of cells are present in ground tissue they are 1 parenchyma cells 2 collenchyma cells 3 sclerenchyma cells parenchyma cells living even at functional maturity mature cells have primary cell walls which are relatively thin flexible and most of the cells lack secondary walls they have a large central vacuole functions perform most of the metabolic functions of the plants eg synthesis of various organic products storage eg some cells in root and stems contain plastids leucoplasts which store starch most of the parenchyma cells retain the ability to divide and differentiate under suitable conditions this ability is important in wound repair these abilities also make it possible to multiply and differentiate cells even from a single parenchyma cell in tissue culture practices collenchyma cells they are generally elongated they have thicker primary walls than parenchyma cells their walls are unevenly thickened young stems and petioles often have strands of collenchyma cells just below the epidermis even at functional maturity they are living flexible and elongating with stems and leaves they support functions give mechanical support to leaves and stems without restraining growth sclerenchyma cells secondary cell walls are produced after cell elongation they have secondary cell walls thickened by large amount of lignin they are dead cells at maturity there are two types of sclerenchyma cells 1 sclereids 2 fibers sclereids are shorter and wider than fibers and irregular in shape they have very thick lignifi ed secondary cell walls they are found in places where growth has stopped eg nut shells seed coats and flesh of coarse fruit fibers are usually grouped in strands they are long slender and tapered used commercially to obtain fibers eg coconut husk fiber hemp fibers functions sclereids and fibers are specialized to provide support and strength vascular tissues xylem and phloem xylem tissue it consists of vessel elements tracheids fibers and parenchyma cells in angiosperms and some of the gymnosperms vessel elements and tracheids mainly conduct water they are dead at functional maturity fibers give mechanical strength parenchyma functions in storage and in radial transportation vessel elements in all angiosperms and some gymnosperms contain vessel elements they are cylindrical and long they are wider shorter and have thinner walls than tracheids secondary walls are thickened by lignin they provide support to prevent collapse under tension of water transport perforation plates are present at end walls of vessel elements other walls are interrupted by pits they form xylem vessel by aligning end to end with perforation plates water flows freely through perforation plates tracheids found in all vascular plants long thin cells with tapering ends secondary walls are thickened with lignin and often interrupted by pits water moves from end to end through pits thickening by lignin provides support to prevent collapse under water transport phloem tissue it consist of sieve tube elements companion cells parenchyma cells and fibers in angiosperms except fibers other phloem cells are living cells in seedless vascular plants and gymnosperms sieve tube elements and companion cells are absent instead of sieve tube elements long narrow cells called sieve cells are present in these plants sieve tube elements sieve tube elements lack nucleus ribosomes a distinct vacuole and cytoskeletal elements cytoplasm reduced into a thin peripheral layer absence of these allow passing of nutrients more freely chains of sieve tube elements are aligned to form sieve tubes the end walls between sieve tube elements contain porous plate called sieve plate sieve plate allows movement of fluid from one sieve element to the next companion cells they are nonconducting cells found alongside in each sieve tube element and connects with sieve tube element by numerous plasmodesmata nucleus and ribosomes of these cells also serve to adjacent sieve tube element some companion cells in leaves help in phloem loading and in other organs unloading,the unit focuses on the structure growth and development of vascular plants which consist of root and shoot systems plant growth occurs at tips called meristems which are undifferentiated tissues that divide and differentiate into various tissues key meristem types include apical meristems located at root and shoot tips responsible for primary growth increasing length lateral meristems in woody plants responsible for secondary growth increasing circumference such as vascular cambium produces xylem and phloem and cork cambium produces periderm intercalary meristems found in grasses allowing rapid regrowth plant tissues include dermal tissue protective outer covering eg epidermis ground tissue fills gaps and includes parenchyma storage collenchyma support and sclerenchyma strength vascular tissue comprises xylem conducts water and phloem conducts nutrients
plant growth growth involves irreversible increase of dry mass associated with the development of an organism often it is associated with increase of cell number as a result of producing more cells from the meristem accompanied by cell elongation plants continue growth throughout the life known as indeterminate growth primary structure root apart of the distribution pattern of xylem and phloem tissue structures of both monocot and dicot roots are more or less similar outermost cell layer is epidermis cells have unicellular outgrowths called root hairs epidermis protects inner parts while root hairs involve in the absorption of water and minerals between epidermis and vascular cylinder there is a ground tissue known as cortex which is made up of mostly parenchyma cells with intercellular spaces cortex mainly stores carbohydrates and also ransports water and minerals towards the endodermis innermost single cell layer of the cortex is the endodermis endodermis contains a suberin belt called casparian strip and no intercellular spaces therefore it blocks cortical apoplast from the vascular apoplast interior to endodermis there is a pericycle containing two or three parenchyma cell layers these cells in dicot roots have meristematic function and involve in the formation of lateral roots and secondary growth of the root inner to pericycle there is vascular tissues as a solid core xylem can be found in the middle and it is star shaped in a cross section of a dicot root phloem is located in the groove between the arms of xylem in monocot roots vascular tissue consists of a central core of parenchyma cells surrounded by a ring of alternating xylem and phloem pericycle in monocot roots is not meristematic primary structure of dicotyledonous plant stem the outermost epidermal cell layer protects inner parts from desiccation and infections the epidermis is interrupted by pores called stomata interior to epidermis is cortex mostly containing parenchyma cells collenchyma cells may also be present just beneath the epidermis to provide strength sclerenchyma such as fibers are also present in the cortex to provide additional support vascular bundles arranged as a ring vascular bundle contains primary phloem towards cortex primary xylem towards pith and inbetween a cambium tissue outside vascular bundle there is a cluster of sclerenchyma cell inner to vascular bundles large pith which is also made up of parenchyma cells can be found lateral shoots develop from axillary buds primary structure of the monocotyledonous stem ground tissue of monocot shoot is not differentiated into cortex and pith the vascular bundles are scattered throughout the ground tissue in most monocot stems each vascular bundle is surrounded by sclerenchyma it consists of a xylem tissue and a phloem tissue but no cambium inbetween xylem and phloem secondary growth increase in the diameter of stems and roots in plants due to the new cells produced by lateral meristems is called secondary growth this occurs in stems and roots of woody perennial plants including all gymnosperms species and many dicot species lateral meristems namely vascular cambium and cork cambium produce cells and tissues in the secondary growth the vascular cambium adds secondary xylem wood towards primary xylem and secondary phloem towards primary phloem increasing vascular flow and support for the shoots the cork cambium produces tough thick covering consisting mainly of wax impregnated cells that protect the stem from water loss and from invasion of insects bacteria and fungi in woody plants primary growth and secondary growth occur simultaneously as the primary growth adds new cells and lengthens stems and roots in the younger regions of a plant secondary growth increases the diameter of stems and roots inolder regions where primary growth has ceased secondary vascular tissue is produced by the action of vascular cambium in a typical woody stem the vascular cambium consists of a continuous cylinder of undifferentiated cells of often only a single cell layer in thickness located outside the pith and primary xylem and to the inside of the cortex and primary phloem in a typical woody root the vascular cambium forms laterally exterior to the primary xylem and interior to the primary phloem and pericycle as these meristematic cells divides they increase circumference of the vascular cambium and also add secondary xylem to the inside of the cambium and secondary phloem to the outside viewed in a cross section the vascular cambium appears as a ring of initials some initials are elongated and are oriented with their long axis parallel to the axis of stem or root they produce cells such as tracheids vessel elements parenchyma and fibers of the xylem as well as sievetube elements companion cells phloem fibers and phloem parenehyma the other initials are shorter and oriented perpendicular to the axis of the stem or root they produce vascular raysmostly parenchyma cells that connect secondary xylem and phloem store carbohydrates and aid in wound repairing as the secondary growth continues over many years layers of secondary xylem wood accumulate the walls of the secondary xylem cells are heavily lignified and account for the hardness and strength of wood during early stages of secondary growth the epidermis pushed outwards causing it to split dry and falls off the stem or root it is replaced by two tissues produced by cork cambium a cylinder of dividing cells that arises in the outer layer of cortex in stems and in the outer layer of pericycle in the roots cork cambium produces cork cells to exterior cork cambium and tissues it produces are collectively called periderm as the cork cells mature they deposit a waxy hydrophobic material called suberin in their walls and they become dead cells the cork tissues function as a barrier that helps protect the stem or root from water loss physical damages and pathogens each cork cambium and the tissues it produces comprise a layer of periderm which is impermeable to water and gasses for gaseous exchange small pores are present in the periderm known as lenticels which are formed by loosely arranged cork cells they appear as horizontal slits further growth of stem or root breaks the layer of cork cambium and it lacks its meristematic activity and its cells become cork cells a new cork cambium is initiated inside which with produce a new layer of periderm as new cells are added the outer regions of cork will crack and peel off in many tree trunks due to the tissue layers produced by vascular cambium and cork cambium girth of the stem or root increases in secondary growth bark is all tissues out of the vascular cambium cork is commonly and incorrectly referred to as bark its main components are secondary phloem and periderm heart wood and sap wood as a woody plant ages the older layers of secondary xylem no longer transport water and minerals these layers are called heartwood because they are close to the centre of the stem or root the newest outer layers of secondary xylem still transport xylem sap are known as sapwood the heartwood is generally darker than sapwood because of resins and other compounds that permeate the cell cavities and help protect the core of the tree from fungi and woodboring insects only the young secondary phloem functions in phloem translocation and old secondary phloem is sloughed off hard wood and soft wood hard wood is the secondary xylem of dicot angiosperms while wood of gymnosperms are named soft wood xylem vessels are absent in soft wood growth rings the thickness of secondary xylem and the lumen of vessels are larger in periods of warm and wet seasons compared to other growth season of the year these differences are visible in a cross section as lighter and darker rings these are referred as growth rings in temperate regions wood that develops early in spring is known as spring wood this xylem tissue consists of xylem vessels with large lumens and thin walls this structure maximizes delivery of water to new leaves the wood produced during rest of the growing season is called summer wood these xylem tissues consist of xylem vessels with thick walls and small lumen do not transport much water but provide more support these two woods collectively known as an annual ring a years growth appears as distinct ring in the cross section of most tree trunks and roots therefore age of the tree can be estimated by counting annual rings in trees growing in temperate regions shoot architecture and light capture length of the stem and branching pattern are designed to capture maximum light plants grow tall to avoid shading from neighboring plants stem most tall plants have thick stem with strong mechanical support woody plants undergo secondary growth thereby make their tall stem stronger vines rely on other objects to reach higher levels to capture more light branching pattern there is a variety in branching pattern some plants are unbranched and still others are well branched this variation in branching pattern enables the plant to absorb maximum light in the ecological niche it occupies leaves leaf size size of the leaf vary based on the place where the plant grows largest leaves are found in plants growing in rain forests smallest leaves are found in plant species inhabiting dry or very cold environments phyllotaxy this is the arrangement of leaves on the stem the arrangement may be one leaf two leaves or several leaves per node phyllotaxy helps the plant to capture maximum sunlight leaf orientation leaves may be horizontally oriented they capture light efficiently in low light conditions some plants have vertically arranged leaves eg grasses this is to avoid the possible damage caused by exposure of leaf to the over intense light when leaves are nearly vertical light rays are parallel to the leaf surfaces so no leaves receive too much of light,plant growth refers to the irreversible increase in dry mass and cell number occurring throughout their life indeterminate growth key structures in plant growth include
anatomy of typical dicot and monocot leaves in most vascular plants leaves are the main photosynthetic organs the exchange of gases occurs through stomata in the upper and lower epidermis epidermis is usually a single cell layer in between the upper and lower epidermis there is a ground tissue called the mesophyll this tissue consists of parenchyma cells specialized for photosynthesis in dicot leaves stomata are mainly found in the lower epidermis the mesophyll consists of two distinct layers called palisade and spongy palisade mesophyll consists of elongated cells that are arranged in one or more layers this can be found in the upper part of the leaf just beneath the upper epidermis the spongy mesophyll can be found between the palisade layer and lower epidermis they are loosely arranged with many air spaces spongy mesophyll cells have less chloroplasts than in palisade mesophyll cells the vascular tissue of the leaf is continuous with vascular tissue of the stem veins in the leaf is highly branched net like venation in the mesophyll layer each vein is protected by a bundle sheath layer in monocot leaves stomata are present in both lower and upper epidermis mesophyll is not differentiated into palisade and spongy layers chloroplasts are abundant in all mesophyll cells veins are parallelly arranged parallel venation structure of stomata stomata are pores surrounded by guard cells in the epidermis of the leaves and stems of plants which can open and close guard cells are modified epidermal cells which have a distinct shape and are the only epidermal cells that contain chloroplasts guard cells are typically bean shaped in angiosperms the guard cell walls are unevenly thickened the inner cellulose wall is thicker and less elastic than the outer wall some of the cellulose microfibrils are radially arranged to form inelastic hoops around guard cells guard cells regulate the diameter of the stomata by changing shape widening or narrowing the gap between the pair of guard cells gaseous exchange gaseous exchange is the exchange of gases between the cells of the organism and the environment in plants gaseous exchange is possible via stomata and lenticels in addition to these a small amount of gases can be exchanged via cuticle there is no special system within plants for the transport of o2and co2these gases move entirely by diffusion mechanism of opening and closing of stomata stomatal opening and closing depends on changes in turgor of the guard cells if water flows into the cells by osmosis their turgor increases and they expand but they do not expand uniformly in all directions the relatively inelastic inner walls make them bend and draw away from each other the result is that the pore opens if the guard cells lose water the reverse happens their turgor decreases and their inner walls become straighter thus closing the pore the k influx hypothesis explains the mechanism k influx hypothesis during the day time the guard cells actively accumulate k from neighboring epidermal cells thus lowering their water potential that leads to the inflow of water by osmosis from the surrounding epidermal cells as a result the turgor pressure in guard cells increase opening stomata the accumulation of k in the guard cells requires the energy which is provided by the transfer of electrons during photosynthesis of the chloroplast in guard cells stomatal closing occurs by loss of k from guard cells to neighbouring epidermal cells it leads to exosmosis of water from guard cells as a result the turgor pressure in guard cells decrease closing stomata abscisic acid aba also plays a role in k influx mechanism role of aba in stomatal closure in drought aba is produced in roots and leaves in response to water deficiency production of aba leads to close the stomata by removal of k in guard cells this prevents the wilting of the plant factors affecting stomatal action stomata open during day and mostly closed at night light stimulates accumulation of k in guard cells decrease in co 2 concentration in substomatal cavity lead to open stomata internal clock in the guard cells controlling their daily rhythm of opening and closing of stomata environmental stresses such as drought high temperature and wind can cause stomata to close during the day time,leaves in vascular plants are the primary organs for photosynthesis and gas exchange through stomata which are pores regulated by guard cells epidermis is a single cell layer covering the leaf while mesophyll made up of parenchyma cells is responsible for photosynthesis dicot leaves stomata mainly on the lower epidermis mesophyll consists of palisade elongated cells and spongy loosely arranged cells with air spaces layers vascular tissue has netlike venation monocot leaves stomata present on both epidermises mesophyll is uniform with abundant chloroplasts vascular tissue has parallel venation stomata facilitate gas exchange o and co via diffusion the mechanism of opening and closing relies on changes in turgor pressure in guard cells influenced by potassium ions k abscisic acid aba plays a crucial role in stomatal closure during drought by facilitating k loss factors affecting stomatal action include light co concentration and environmental stresses
need for transport as land plants evolved and increased in number competition for light water and nutrients also increased as a result the size and complexity of plant body increased therefore the simple ways of transportation of water and material became inadequate leading to the evolution of vascular tissues consisting of xylem and phloem to carryout long distance transport in plants eg the xylem transports water and minerals from roots to shoots the phloem transports products of photosynthesis from where they are made or stored to where they are needed methods of water and solutes movement both active and passive transport mechanisms occur in plants active transport passive transport diffusion osmosis imbibitions facilitated diffusion bulk flow long distance passive transport occurs spontaneously and it does not require metabolic energy atp movement of some materials across membranes takes place using atp and that process is called an active transport diffusion molecules have an energy called thermal energy due to their constant motion one result of this motion is diffusion in the absence of other forces the movement of molecules of a substance from a place where it is more concentrated to place where it is less concentrated due to random motion of molecules is called diffusion the motion of a molecule is random but movement of a population of molecules by diffusion is directional therefore diffusion takes place according to a concentration gradient spontaneously and not using metabolic energy atp diffusion takes place across the membrane also if the membrane is permeable to those molecules eg water and soluble materials can diffuse through the cellulose cell wall o 2 and co2 can diffuse through the plasma membrane osmosis osmosis is a special type of diffusion the diffusion of free water molecules across a selectively permeable membrane is called osmosis free water is water molecules that are not bound to solutes or surfaces imbibition the physical adsorption of water molecules by hydrophilic materials is called imbibition eg adsorption of water molecules by the cellulose cell walls facilitated diffusion movement of water and hydrophilic solutes across the membranes passively with the help of transport protein that span the membrane is called facilitated diffusion transport proteins are very specific they transport some substances but not the others this movement also takes place along concentration gradient and it is a passive movement bulk flow bulk flow is the movement of liquid and the materials entire solution in response to pressure gradient always the bulk flow transports materials from higher pressure to lower pressure region it is a longdistance transport method this flow does not occur through the membranes and occurs at much greater speed than diffusion this method of transport is independent of solute concentration gradient concept of water potential the physical property that predicts the direction in which water will flow governed by solute concentration and applied pressure is called water potential water potential is related to potential energy of water molecules any system that contains water has a water potential free water moves from regions of higher water potential to regions of lower water potential if there is no barrier to its flow water potential is denoted by is measured in a unit of megapascal mpa arbitrary the of pure water in a container open to the atmosphere under standard conditions at sea level and room temperature is 0 mpa both solute concentration and physical pressure can affect water potential as expressed in the water potential equation s p water potential s solute potential p pressure potential solute potential solute potential is directly proportional to the molarity of a solution s is also called osmotic potential solutes affect the direction of osmosis the solutes in plants are typically mineral ions and sugars of pure water is 0 mpa when solutes are added they bind water molecules and reduce free water molecules reducing capacity of the water to move and do work in this way an increase in solutes has a negative effect on water potential therefore s of a solution is always expressed as a negative number as the solute concentration increases s will become more negative eg s of the 01m sugar solution is 023mpa pressure potential pressure potential p is the physical pressure on a solution p can be positive or negative relative to atmospheric pressure eg p of a xylem vessel is usually less than 2 mpa as xylem vessels are under tension negative pressure p of a living cell is a positive value because living cell is usually under positive pressure due to osmotic uptake of water the cell contents press the plasma membrane against the cell wall then press against the protoplast producing a pressure called turgor pressure when turgor pressure increases the of cell also increases water potential of a cell cell is a system containing water therefore it has a water potential the protoplast is an aqueous system and it contains solutes therefore it has a solute potential s which is negative because of s of the cell is decreased due to the turgor pressure internal pressure of protoplast increases and increases pressure potential p of the cell because of p of cell increased therefore water potential of a cell is given by the following equation s p entry of water into vacuolated cell across the cell membrane if a cell is placed in a solution direction of water movement depends on the water potential of external solution and protoplast take a fully flaccid cell as a result of water losing the p of that cell is 0 p 0 s s of pure water is 0 and addition of solutes will increase the negative value of s or become more negative suppose this flaccid cell is placed in a solution of higher solute concentration more negative solute potential than the cell itself since the external solution has a lower more negative water potential water diffuse out of the cell the protoplast of the cell shrinks and pulls away from the cell wall this process is known as plasmolysis suppose this flaccid cell is placed in pure water 0 mpa the cell has a lower water potential than the pure water as it contains solutes therefore water enters the cell by osmosis then the protoplast of the cell begins to swell and press the plasma membrane against the cell wall the partially elastic cell exerting a turgor pressure contains the pressurized protoplast therefore p is increased gradually the maximum value of p s of the cell therefore becomes 0 this matches the water potential of extracellular environment 0 mpa then a dynamic equilibrium is formed and there is no further net water movement if the cell has the maximum value for p it equal to the s of the cell the cell is said to be in fully turgid state fully turgid or fully flaccid cells are not found in nature therefore if nonwoody tissue is placed in a solution with higher water potential it is stiffened and is very rigid therefore turgor pressure helps support of non woody plants turgor pressure is also important in cell elongation loss of turgor results in wilting a condition where leaves and stem droop movement of water and minerals from soil solution to plant root the cells near the root tips of the roots are important because most of the absorption of water and minerals occurs there in this region the epidermal cells are permeable to water and many are differentiated to root hairs root hairs account for much of the absorption of water by roots due to increase in surface area the root hairs absorb the soil solution which consists of water molecules and dissolved mineral ions that are not bound tightly to soil particles this absorption takes place across the plasma membrane water can enter root hair by osmosis a passive movement along the concentration gradient but in the root hairs concentration of mineral ions is greater than that of soil solution k concentration in the root hair is hundreds of time greater than in the soil solution therefore mineral ions transport occurs against concentration gradient by an active transport the soil solution is also absorbed into hydrophilic walls of the epidermal cells and passes freely along the cell walls and the extracellular spaces into the root cortex,as land plants evolved they developed vascular tissues xylem and phloem for efficient longdistance transport of water minerals and nutrients key transport mechanisms include active transport requires atp to move substances against their concentration gradient passive transport occurs spontaneously without energy including diffusion movement of molecules from high to low concentration osmosis diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane facilitated diffusion transport of solutes with the help of specific proteins imbibition water adsorption by hydrophilic materials bulk flow movement of liquid in response to a pressure gradient water potential predicts the direction of water flow and is defined by the equation s p where s is solute potential negative value due to solutes and p is pressure potential can be positive or negative water movement into plant cells depends on the water potential gradient leading to processes like turgor pressure which supports nonwoody plants and aids in cell elongation
transport of water and minerals entered from soil to root cortex into the xylem of the root is known as radial transport the endodermis the innermost layer of cells in the cortex functions as the last check point for selective passage of the minerals from the cortex into the vascular cylinder all materials which enters root through cell walls and extracellular spaces should cross the membranes of endodermis therefore unwanted materials can be selectively excluded three routes are used in the radial transport they are 1 apoplastic route 2 symplastic route 3 transmembrane route apoplastic route the apoplastic route consists of everything external to the plasma membrane of living cells and includes cell walls extracellular spaces and the interior of dead cells such as vessel elements and tracheids water and solutes move along continuum of the cell walls and extracellular spaces and it is known as apoplastic route uptake of soil solution by the hydrophilic walls of root hairs provides access to the apoplast water and minerals then can diffuse into cortex along this matrix of walls and extracellular spaces endodermis blocks apoplastic route by a barrier located in the transverse and radial walls of endodermal cells called the casparian strips it is a belt made of suberin which is impervious to water and mineral salts thus water and minerals cannot cross the endodermis and enter the vascular cylinder via apoplast therefore water and minerals cross the selectively permeable plasma membrane before entering the vascular tissue and keep unneeded and toxic materials out the endodermis also prevents solutes that have accumulated in the xylem from leaking back into the soil solution symplastic route the symplast consists of the entire mass of cytosol of all living cells in a plant as well as plasmodesmata the cytoplasmic channels that interconnect them in the symplastic route water and solutes move along the continuum of cytosol this route requires substance to cross a plasma membrane once when they first enter the plant after entering one cell substances can move from cell to cell via plasmodesmata transmembrane route the transmembrane route requires repeated crossing of plasma membranes as water and solutes exit one cell and enter the next as the soil solution moves along the apoplast some water and minerals are transported into the protoplast of the cells of the epidermis and cortex and then move via the symplast some substances can use more than one route the least resistence for the transport is found in apoplastic route therefore more water use apoplastic route finally water and minerals enter into the tracheids and vessel elements of xylem these waters conducting cells lack protoplasts when mature and therefore they are parts of the apoplast endodermal cells and living cells of the vascular tissues discharge minerals from their protoplast to their own cell walls both diffusion and active transport involve in transport of solutes from symplast to apoplast then water and minerals can enter the tracheids and vessel elements to the transport to shoot system by bulk flow only through the apoplast upward movement of water and minerals in a plant water and minerals which enter to vascular cylinder are transported to upper parts of the plant and this transport is known as ascent of xylem sap xylem sap the water and dissolved minerals in the xylem gets transported by bulk flow which is much faster than diffusion to explain the process involved in the ascent of xylem sap cohesiontension hypothesis is put forward according to this hypothesis transpiration provides pull for the ascent of xylem sap and cohesion of water molecules transmits this pull along the entire length of xylem from shoots to roots hence xylem sap is normally under tension negative pressure the negative pressure potential helps water to move up through xylem and water moves according to the water potential gradient adhesion and cohesion facilitate transport water by bulk flow due to high adhesion water molecules are attracted to cellulose molecules in the xylem walls cohesion of water molecules is unusually high due to hydrogen bonds among water molecules therefore a continuous water column is formed within xylem vessels and tracheids transpiration pull can extend down to the root only through an unbroken chain of water as water evaporates from the mesophyll cells water potential of mesophyll reduces and water moves from cells of petioles to the mesophyll cells it reduces the water potential of cells of petioles then water pulls upward due to this transpiration pull the xylem sap is driven by difference in pressure potential therefore the water potential gradient within xylem is essentially a pressure gradient the tensile force on xylem sap is transmitted all the way from the leaves to the root tips and even into the soil therefore water potential gradient between the soil solution and atmosphere through the plant body also help ascent of xylem sap against the gravity the plants do not need energy to lift the xylem sap mechanism of mineral absorption into root mineral ions are absorbed by the plant roots mainly from the soil solution epidermal cells are permeable to water and many epidermal cells are modified to form root hairs root hair cells are unicellular structures which absorb dissolved mineral ions from the soil solution soil solution has a lower concentration of ions than that of the cell sap of root hair cells therefore absorption takes place against a concentration gradient,transport of water and minerals from the soil into the xylem of roots known as radial transport occurs through three routes apoplastic symplastic and transmembrane apoplastic route involves movement through cell walls and extracellular spaces blocked by the casparian strip in the endodermis which prevents unwanted substances from entering the vascular cylinder symplastic route water and solutes move through the cytoplasm of living cells interconnected by plasmodesmata transmembrane route requires repeated crossing of plasma membranes as substances move from one cell to another water and minerals ascend through the plant via xylem sap driven by the cohesiontension hypothesis this process relies on transpiration evaporation of water creates a negative pressure that pulls water upward cohesion and adhesion water molecules stick together and to the xylem walls maintaining a continuous column of water mineral absorption occurs mainly through root hairs which absorb dissolved minerals against a concentration gradient
basic characteristics of phloem transport the transport of the product of photosynthesis is carried out by the phloem tissue known as phloem translocation in angiosperms the sievetube elements of the phloem are specialized cells for translocation phloem sap the aqueous solution that flows through sieve tubes differs from xylem sap mainly because it contains sucrose as 30 by weight and it may also contain amino acids hormones and minerals phloem sap moves from sites of sugar production to site of sugar use or storage therefore it takes place from sugar source to a sugar sink sugar source is an organ that is a net producer of sugar by photosynthesis or by breakdown of starch plant leaves are sources whereas growing roots stems buds and fruits are sinks storage organs such as tubers and bulbs may be a source or a sink depending on its function mechanism of phloem translocation sinks usually receive sugar from the nearest sugar sources for each sieve tube the direction of transport depends on the locations of the sugar source and sugar sink that are connected by that tube therefore neighbouring sieve tubes may carry sap in opposite directions if they originate and end in different locations the first step in translocation of sugar is to transport or load into sieve tube elements in some species it moves from mesophyll cells to sieve tube elements via symplast passing through plasmodesmata in many plants sugar movements into phloem requires active transport because sucrose is more concentrated in sieve tube element and companion cells than mesophyll cells sucrose is unloaded at the sink end of the sieve tube the process varies by species and organ however the concentration of free sugar in sink is always lower than in the sieve tube because the unloaded sugar is consumed during growth and metabolism of cells of sinks or converted to insoluble polymers such as starch as a result of concentration gradient sugar molecules diffuse from phloem into the sink and water follows by osmosis phloem sap moves from source to sink at a rate about 1mhr and it moves by bulk flow driven by positive pressure known as pressure flow phloem translocation of angiosperms is explained by pressure flow hypothesis in this translocation following processes take place 1 loading of sugar into the sieve tube reduces water potential inside the sieve tube elements at the source 2 this causes the sieve tube to take up water from the xylem by osmosis 3 this uptake of water generates a positive pressure that forces the sap to flow along the tube 4 the pressure is reduced by unloading of sugar and consequent loss of water from phloem to the xylem at the sink process of water loss in plants transpiration removal of water from leaves and other aerial parts of the plant body as water vapour by diffusion is known as transpiration this water loss takes place in plants mainly through stomatastomatal transpiration upto some extent through cuticlecuticular transpiration and through lenticels lenticular transpiration about 95 of water in plants is lost through stomatal transpiration in the day time air in the intercellular air spaces is saturated with water vapour because they are in contact with the moist cell walls normally air outside the plant is drier than inside hence water potential of outside air is lower than that of inside therefore water vapour in the air spaces of the plant diffuses down its water potential gradient and exits the plant stomatal transpiration water is brought to the leaf in the xylem of vascular bundle and subsequently spread from a fi ne branching network throughout the leaf these branches end in one or few xylem vessels or tracheids possessing little lignification therefore water can release easily through their cellulose walls to mesophyll cells water moves through the mesophyll cells by apoplast symplast and transmembrane pathways according to water potential gradient then water evaporate from the wet walls of the mesophyll cells into the intercellular air spaces particularly into the large substomatal air spaces from here water vapour diffuses through the stomata to the atmosphere immediately next to the leaf is a thin layer of stationary air through which water vapour diffuses out and swept away by moving air there is a diffusion gradient from the stationary layer back to the mesophyll cells each stomata has a diffusion gradient or diffusion shell around it the diffusion shell of neighbouring stomata overlap in still air to form one overall diffusion shell layer thickness of the diffusion shell depends on the surface features of the leaf and wind speed factors affecting the rate of transpiration 1 light intensity 2 temperature 3 humidity 4 wind speed 5 concentration of co 2 6 available water in soil light intensity stomata usually open in the light and close in darkness with the increase of light intensity the rate of transpiration increases temperature in the presence of light the external factor which has the greatest effect on transpiration is temperature the higher the temperature the greater the rate of evaporation of water from mesophyll cells which result the greater saturation of the leaf atmosphere with water vapour at the same time a rise in temperature lowers the relative humidity of the air outside the leaf both events result in a steeper concentration gradient of water molecules from leaf to external atmosphere the steeper this gradient is the faster the rate of diffusion humidity low humidity outside environment of the leaf increases transpiration because it makes the diffusion gradient of water vapour from the moist leaf atmosphere to drier external atmosphere as the concentration of water vapour in the external atmosphere is high when humidity rises the diffusion gradient becomes less steep result in lower transpiration wind speed in still air a shell of highly saturated air builds up around the leaf thus reducing the steepness of the diffusion gradient between leaf atmosphere and external atmosphere which makes the transpiration rate low in windy condition flow of air will generally sweep away the shell therefore windy condition increases transpiration rate availability of soil water as soil dries out water usually binds more tightly to soil particles reducing the amount of available water the soil solution becomes more concentrated and its water potential decreases therefore tendency for water to enter by osmosis is lower this reduces water uptake by plants and as a result transpiration rate is also reduced there is greater resistance to movement of water through the plant due to less steep water potential gradient from the soil through the plant to the atmosphere signifi cance of transpiration to plants 1 distribute minerals and water throughout the plant 2 ascent of water in the xylem 3 uptake of water and minerals by roots from the soil solution root pressure and guttation at night when the relative humidity is high approaching 100 transpiration rate is very low or zero root cells continuously pump water and mineral ions into xylem tissue the endodermis prevents ions from leaking back into the cortex and soil therefore more mineral ions accumulate in the vascular cylinder and reduce water potential therefore water moves from the cortex it generates a root pressure and upward push of xylem sap due to root pressure more water enters to the leaves than lost by transpiration this results in removal of water droplets from leaf tips or leaf margins of some herbaceous plants that process is known as guttation guttation fluid differs from dew which is condensed moisture of the atmosphere many plants do not generate any root pressure and therefore there is no guttation even in plants that display guttation root pressure cannot match the water loss by transpiration after sun rise and therefore no guttation is seen in the day time because then xylem sap is not pushed but pulled upward by transpiration root pressure is never sufficient to push water up distance over meters guttation takes place through the hydathode which are formed by special groups of cells located near the ends of small veins and does not take place through the stomata eg alocasia colocasia,phloem transport or phloem translocation is the movement of photosynthesis products primarily sucrose through specialized sievetube elements in angiosperms key points include phloem sap contains about 30 sucrose along with amino acids hormones and minerals moving from sugar sources leaves to sinks growing roots stems fruits mechanism sucrose is actively transported into sieve tubes creating a concentration gradient that allows diffusion to the sink water follows by osmosis creating positive pressure that drives the saps flow pressure flow hypothesis transpiration the loss of water vapor from aerial plant parts primarily through stomata helps maintain water and mineral transport factors influencing transpiration include light intensity temperature humidity wind speed co concentration and soil water availability root pressure occurs when root cells pump water into xylem generating upward pressure potentially leading to guttation water droplets in certain plants
nutrition is the process of acquiring raw materials and energy from the environment for the metabolic activities of organisms plants require nutrients for their growth development and reproduction modes of nutrition in plants autotrophic nutrition autotrophism the organisms who exhibit autotrophism are referred to as autotrophs autotrophs synthesize organic materials from co2 and inorganic materials plants are photoautotrophs which utilizes light energy in order to synthesize organic molecules from inorganic material symbiosis symbiosis is an ecological relationship in which two species live in close contact with each other there are three types they are mutualism parasitism and commensalism mutualism a symbiotic relationship in which both participants are benefi ted eg legume root nodules with nitrogen fi xing bacteria rhizobium mycorrhizae symbiotic association of roots of higher plants with fungi corolloid root of cycas with anabaena commensalism it is an interaction between two species in which benefi ts one of the species and neither harm nor benefi ts the other eg epiphytic orchids parasitism it is a close association between two different species which is benefi cial to one the parasite and harmful to the other the host eg semi parasiticloranthus and host plant parasitic cuscuta dodder plant and host plants special mode of nutrition carnivorous plants these plants are photosynthetic but obtain nitrogen and minerals by killing and digesting insects and other small animals they live in habitats where the soil is poor in nitrogen and other minerals eg nepenthes drosera utricularia nutritional requirements for the optimal growth of plants essential elements elements which are required for a plant to complete its life cycle and produce another generation seventeen essential elements are needed by all plants cohnpskca mg cl fe mn b zn cu ni mo essential elements are two types macronutrients macronutrients plants need these elements in large amounts eg cohnpskca mg 9 elements micronutrients plants require these elements in small amounts eg cl fe mn b zn cu ni mo macro elements and their functions and defi ciency symptoms carbon c is taken in as co2 from atmospheric air and forms a major component of organic molecules in plants a deficiency results in poor growth similarly oxygen o also absorbed as co2 from air and soil solution is vital for organic molecules in plants with deficiency leading to stunted growth hydrogen h is absorbed as h2o from soil solution contributing to organic molecules and leading to wilting if deficient nitrogen n is taken up as no3 or nh4 from the soil essential for amino acids proteins and chlorophyll deficiency leads to stunted growth and chlorosis in older leaves potassium k in the form of k is necessary for enzyme activation and stomatal function and its deficiency results in yellow leaf margins weak stems and poor root development calcium ca is absorbed as ca2 playing a role in cell wall structure and membrane maintenance deficiency causes crinkled leaves and death of terminal buds magnesium mg taken in as mg2 is a component of chlorophyll and activates enzymes deficiency leads to chlorosis in older leaves phosphorus p absorbed as h2po4 is part of atp and nucleic acids with deficiency causing slow growth thin stems and poor flowering sulfur s taken as so42 forms amino acids with chlorosis in younger leaves when deficient other elements like chlorine cl important for osmosis and ionic balance iron fe involved in chlorophyll synthesis zinc zn activating enzymes and chlorophyll formation boron b for cell wall function copper cu activating enzymes molybdenum mo and nickel ni involved in nitrogen metabolism and manganese mn activating photosynthesis enzymes are also critical deficiencies in these elements lead to various symptoms such as leaf discoloration chlorosis crinkled leaves stunted growth or death of plant tips,nutrition in plants involves acquiring raw materials and energy for metabolic activities plants exhibit autotrophic nutrition where they synthesize organic materials from inorganic sources primarily using photosynthesis nutritional modes include
trends in life cycles to relate the adaptations of plants for a terrestrial life sexual reproduction of terrestrial plants the life cycles of all land plants exhibit alternation of generations which means the presence of haploid generation and diploid generation alternatively with each producing the other the two multicellular body forms that alternate in the life cycles of land plants are the haploid gametophyte and diploid sporophyte which are morphologically different therefore called heteromorphic alternation of generations their reproductive organs gametangia and sporangia are protected by sterile cell layers to prevent desiccation of mother cells gamete forming cells and spore forming cells gametophytes produce gametes by mitosis all land plants carryout internal fertilization to prevent desiccation of gametes female egg ovum is retained in the archegonium and male gametes antherozoids are released from the antheridium seedless plants depend on external water for fertilization but seed plants do not depend on external water for their fertilization after fertilization diploid zygote is retained within the gametophyte to produce an embryo which is nourished by the gametophyte embryo develops into the diploid sporophyte delay of meiosis after fertilization results in creating a diploid sporophytic generation diploid sporophyte produces haploid spores by meiosis spores grow into haploid gametophytes in the course of evolution of land plants diploid sporophytic generation acquire adaptations needed for successful colonization on land and become dominant plant in the life cycle gametophytic generation gradually reduced and has become dependent on the sporophytic generation in seed plants life cycle of pogonatum gametophyte is the dominant plant larger and longerliving than sporophyte gametophyte is photosynthetic stem leaves and rhizoids are present in the gametophyte gametophytes are dioecious unisexual mature male gametophytes produce antheridia in which several sperms are produced female gametophytes produce archegonia a single egg is produced within the archegonium the egg is not released flagellated motile sperm swims through external water towards egg entering the archegonium in response to chemical attractants sperm fuses with the ovum resulting diploid zygote this occurs in the archegonium after fertilization zygote develops into the embryo the embryo is also retained within the archegonium and develops into the diploid sporophyte by obtaining nutrients from the gametophyte the sporophyte remains attached to the gametophyte the sporophyte consists of a foot seta and a capsule sporangium the foot absorbs nutrients and water from the gametophyte the capsule produces spores by meiosis homosporous if spores are dispersed to a favourable habitat such as moist soil or tree bark they may germinate and grow into a green branched fi lament called protonema protonema produces buds that grow into gametophytes life cycle of nephrolepis sporophyte is dominant gametophyte is reduced and short lived both sporophytes and gametophytes are independent and photosynthetic sporophytes have more complex structure plant body is differentiated into roots stem and leaves cuticle is found on aerial parts of the plant body stomata are developed on aerial parts for gaseous exchange two types of vascular tissues xylem and phloem are developed they have fiddlehead young leaves stem is an underground rhizome leaves are compound pinnate leaves long underground branches called stolons arise from the rhizome which gives rise to new plantlets sporangia are developed as clusters called sori on the underside of mature leafl ets sori are covered by the indusium protecting the young sporangia from desiccation spores are produced in the sporangium by meiosis and are homosporous when the sorus matures indusium dries up and shrivels exposing mature sporangia under dry environmental conditions sporangium wall ruptures releasing spores spores are dispersed by wind when spores are dispersed to a favourable habitat they may germinate and grow into a gametophyte gametophyte is a small heart shaped macroscopic green colored photosynthetic thallus rhizoids develop on the ventral surface gametophytes are monoecious bisexual antheridia and archegonia are developed on the ventral side antheridium produces flagellated sperms and releases them into the external environment archegonium produces one egg and retains it motile sperms swim through external water towards egg entering the archegonium in response to chemical attractants sperm fuses with the egg resulting the diploid zygote after fertilization zygote develops into the embryo and then to the young sporophyte while retained in the gametophyte all the developmental stages are nourished by the gametophyte when the young sporophyte develops its photosynthetic tissues it becomes an independent plant life cycle of selaginella sporophytes are dominant and photosynthetic gametophytes are reduced in structure and shortlived partially depend on the sporophyte sporophyte plant body is differentiated into roots stem and leaves vascular tissues present herbaceous heterophyllous leaves are arranged as pairs stem is dorsiventrally flattened sporangia are borne on the specialized leaves called sporophylls sporophylls are compactly arranged in a terminal strobilus two types of sporophylls called megasporophyll and microsporophyll are arranged in the same strobilus megasporophyll produces a single megasporngium and microsporophyll produces a single microsporangium morphologically two different types of spores are produced this nature is called heterospory megasporangium produces four large megaspores by meiosis microsporangium produces numerous small microspores by meiosis both types of spores have thicktough walls microspores are retained in the microsporangium and develop into young male gametophytes young male gametophytes are enclosed by the wall of microspore which are released by the microsporangium in the external environment they become mature male gametophytes male gametophytes is microscopic enclosed in the microspore wall nonphotosynthetic depend on stored food male gametophytes produce flagellated sperms and release them into the external environment megaspores are released into the external environment in the external environment they develop into female gametophytes female gametophyte is multicellular surrounded by the thick wall of megaspore few rhizoids develop photosynthetic but partially depend on stored food in the megaspore archegonia develop at the superficial regions and are fully embedded in the gametophytic tissue one egg is produced inside the archegonium sperm swims towards the egg n using flagella through external water entering into the archegonium and fertilizes the egg n resulting in a zygote2n zygote develops to form an embryo and then embryo develops to form a young sporophyte by obtaining nutrients from the female gametophyte sporophyte generation is the larger and more complex form in the alternation of generation life cycle of cycas sporophytes are the dominant photosynthetic plants in the life cycle gametophytes are reduced and depend on the sporophyte throughout its life sporophytes are a perennial tree with roots stem and leaves stem is unbranched columnar and woody leaves are arranged in crowns compound leaves show xerophytic adaptations and young leaves are fiddleheads sporophytes are heterosporous and dioecious sporophytes have developed a tap root system secondary growth is present sporophytes which produce megaspores are called female plants and those which produce microspores are called male plants mature female plant produces a crown of megasporophylls megasporangium is enclosed in the protective layer called integument to form the ovule integument has a small pore in the distal end of the ovule called micropyle one of the cells in the megasporangial tissue differentiates into a single megaspore mother cell megaspore mother cell undergoes meiosis to form four haploid megaspores out of which only one remains functional the remaining megasporangial tissue functions as nucellus which provides nourishment megaspores are not released to the external environment megaspore develop into the female gametophyte n while within the ovule mature ovule contains the female gametophyte the female gametophyte produces several archegonia each archegonium produces a single egg cell within it mature male plants produce male cones with microsporophylls which consist of microsporangia on the lower surface large numbers of microspores n are produced from microspore mother cells 2n within the microsporangium by meiosis they develop into pollen grains within the sporangium and then discharge pollen grains are dispersed by wind and deposited on the micropyle of a mature ovule is called pollination pollen grains enter into pollen chamber of the ovule through the micropyle in the pollen chamber pollen grains develop into male gametophytes male gametophyte consists of a branched pollen tube which involves in absorption of nutrients from the nucellus male gametophyte is shortlived produce two large sperms with a spiral band of numerous cilia the basal end of the pollen tube ruptures releasing sperms into the archegonial chamber of the ovule sperms swim through the liquid medium and fertilize the egg resulting the 2n zygote zygote develops into the embryo remaining female gametophyte becomes the endosperm which providesnutrients for the developing embryo during seed germination integument becomes the seed coat the ovule becomes the seed seed is the dispersal unit which contains the embryo and stored food that are enclosed in the seed coat seeds are dispersed and under favorable environmental conditions seeds germinate producing the seedlings young sporophyte,terrestrial plants exhibit alternation of generations consisting of a haploid gametophyte and a diploid sporophyte key points include heteromorphic alternation the two body forms are morphologically different gametophytes produce gametes via mitosis while sporophytes produce spores by meiosis reproductive adaptations gametophytes protect reproductive cells from desiccation fertilization occurs internally with the diploid zygote developing into an embryo within the gametophyte life cycles of various plants pogonatum dominant gametophyte fertilization occurs in archegonia nephrolepis dominant sporophyte features cuticles stomata and sori for spore production selaginella heterosporous with distinct male and female gametophytes sperm swim towards the egg in water cycas dominant sporophyte with megasporangium pollen grains are dispersed for fertilization these adaptations facilitate successful colonization of land by providing mechanisms to prevent desiccation ensure internal fertilization and optimize reproductive success
life cycle of flowering plants sporophyte is the dominant plant gametophytes are shortlived microscopic entirely depend on the sporophyte sporophyte produces the reproductive structures called flowers a flower is a specialized shoot with four whorls of modified leaves named sepals petals stamens and carpels sepals are usually green enclose and protect the flower before it opens petals are brightly coloured in most flowers and aid in attracting pollinators but wind pollinated flowers generally lack brightly coloured parts the sepals and petals are sterile floral organs they do not directly involve in reproduction stamens are the microsporophylls the stamen consists of a stalk called fi lament and two terminal lobes called anther anther is made up of microsporangia pollen sacs containing microspore mother cells which produce microspores by meiosis microspores develop into pollen grains within the anther a pollen grain contains two nuclei the tube nucleus and generative nucleus carpels are the megasporophylls at the tip of the carpel is a sticky stigma that receives pollens the swollen base of the carpel forms the ovary ovary contains one or more ovules a long slender neck called style connects ovary with stigma ovule produces four megaspores by meiosis of which only one becomes functional functional megaspore develops into the female gametophyte called the embryo sac it is a highly reduced microscopic structure the mature embryo sac consists of eight nuclei contained within seven cellsthree antipodal cells two polar nuclei in the central cell two synergids and one egg transfer of pollen grains to a mature stigma is known as pollination in some plant species pollen grains are transferred from an anther of a flower on to the stigma of the same flower this is selfpollination pollen may be transferred to a stigma of a different flower this is cross pollination most angiosperm plants are adapted for cross pollination typical characteristics of flowers like such as colour and odour favour cross pollination in addition some plants show special types of adaptations cross pollination eg heterostyly self infertility unisexuality signifi cance of cross pollination cross pollination results in cross fertilization cross fertilization allows shuffling of genes within a species producing new genetic combinations resulting increased genetic variation within the species these features are very important for survival and also might lead to evolution fertilization the pollen grain germinates after it is placed on the stigma it extends a pollen tube that grows down through the style of the carpel the generative nucleus divides forming two sperm nuclei when the pollen tube reaches the ovary it moves through the micropyle the pore in the integuments of the ovule and discharges two sperm nuclei into the embryo sac one sperm nucleus fuses with the egg cell forming a diploid zygote and the other sperm nucleus fuses with the 2 polar nuclei this type of fertilization is called double fertilization and is unique to angiosperms after double fertilization the ovule matures into a seed the zygote develops into the embryo the triploid nucleus develops into the endosperm that store food the significance of double fertilization is that it synchronizes with the development of the embryo if fertilization does not occur that prevents plants from wasting nutrients on infertile ovules the seed consists of the embryo endosperm with store food and a seed coat seeds are enclosed in the fruit fruit is an enlarged and developed ovary usually after being stimulated by fertilization fertilization triggers hormonal changes that cause the ovary to form a fruit if a flower has not been pollinated fruit does not develop and entire flower falls away during fruit development the ovary wall gets converted to the pericarp in some plants fruits develop from the ovary without fertilization this is called parthenocarpy parthenocarpic fruits do not develop seeds parthenocarpy occurs naturally in some species eg banana it also can be induced with plant growth substances to get seedless fruits eg grapes orange in some plants seeds develop without fertilization this is called parthenogenesis eg certain grasses in parthenogenesis the egg is resulted by mitosis and hence is diploidor haploid ovum fuses with a polar nucleus or the genetic content of the egg is duplicated to become diploid enabling seed development without fertilizing by the sperm signifi cance of development of seed and fruit seed seed is the dispersal unit of seed plants which contains the embryo and stored food surrounded by the seed coat the seed habit has a strategy for life on land the presence of seed coat helps to survive in extreme conditions food reservesprovide nourishment to the embryo during development dormancy period helps to survive during unfavorable conditions adaptations for dispersal give a better chance for growth development and survival fruits protects the enclosed seeds when mature aids in their dispersal by wind water or animals after being dispersed if environmental conditions are favourable a seed may germinate to form a seedling inhibition of embryo within the seed at one stage of maturation naturally prevents germination of seeds within fruit which is called seed dormancy many seeds have mechanisms of inhibiting germination and remain dormant presence of inhibitors presence of thickstrong seed coats presence of seed coats impervious to water are common causes of seed dormancy after breaking seed dormancy when water oxygen and suitable temperature are provided seeds start to germinate absorption of water activation of enzymes mobilization of food resources nutrients followed by rapid growth process of the embryo extending radical through the seed coat is called seed germination radical shows positive geotropism and plumule shows negative geotropism,the life cycle of flowering plants involves two main stages the sporophyte and the gametophyte the sporophyte is the dominant diploid phase that produces flowers which contain four whorls sepals petals stamens and carpels pollination occurs when pollen is transferred to the stigma leading to fertilization where a pollen tube delivers sperm nuclei to the ovule resulting in a diploid zygote and a triploid endosperm through double fertilization unique to angiosperms seeds develop within fruits which are mature ovaries seed dormancy prevents premature germination allowing seeds to survive unfavorable conditions until they receive water oxygen and suitable temperature for germination key adaptations include the seed coat for protection and stored food for the developing embryo
responses of plants to different stimuli photomorphogenesis light triggers many key events in plant growth and development collectively known as photomorphogenesis light reception also allows plants to measure the passage of days and seasons plants detect not only light signals but also the direction intensity and wave length color a graph called an action spectrum depicts the relative effectiveness of different wave lengths of radiation in carrying out a particular process such as photosynthesis action spectrum reveals that red and blue light are the most important colors in regulating plants photomorphogenesis the two major classes of light receptors in plants are the blue light photoreceptors and phytochromes which absorb mostly red light blue light photo receptors initiates a variety of responses in plants including phototropism the light induced opening of stomata and the light induced slowing of hypocotyl elongation that occurs when a seedling breaks ground phytochrome photoreceptors regulate many plant responses to light including seed germination and shade avoidance effect of light on seed germination as the nutrient reserves are limited many types of seeds especially small ones germinate only when the light environment and other conditions are nearly optimal such seeds often remain dormant for years until light conditions change eg plowing a fi eld or a death of a shady tree may create a favorable light environment for germination plant spacing phytochromes provide the plant with information about the quality of light which enables the plant to get adapted to changes in outside light conditions eg shade avoidance response of a forest tree below the canopy that requires v relatively high light intensity as the forest canopy absorbs more red light allowing only far red light to pass through the tree below the canopy will allocate more of its resources to grow taller in contrast exposure to direct sunlight increases the proportion of far red red light and thereby stimulates branching and inhibits vertical growth flowering photoperiod is the interval in a 24hour period in which the plant gets exposed to light photoperiod controls flowering in many types of plants shoot elongation and phototropism the growth of a shoot towards light positive or away from it negative is called phototropism positive phototropism strengthen photosynthesis this response results from a differential growth of cells on opposite sides of the shoot the cells in the darker side elongate faster than the cells on the brighter side response to gravity gravitropism shoot of the plant grows upwards while root grows downwards due to their response to gravity or gravitropism gravitropism can be either positive or negative eg roots display positive gravitropism while shoot display negative gravitropism gravitropism occurs as soon as a seed germinates this ensure that the root grows into the soil and shoot grows towards sunlight plants may detect gravity by the settling of statoliths statoliths of vascular plants are specialized plastids containing dense starch grains they can settle under the gravity to the lower portions of the cell in roots they are located in certain cells of the root cap the statolith hypothesis the aggregation of statoliths at the low points of root cap cells triggers redistribution of ca2 which causse lateral transport of auxin within the root as a result ca and auxin get accumulated at lower side of elongation zone of root at high concentration of auxin cell elongation is inhibited resulting slow growth on lower side and more rapid elongation on upper side consequently the root grows downwards response to mechanical stimuli trees grow in windy environment normally have shorter stockier trunks than same species growing in normal environmental conditions advantage of this is that the tree could stand high winds this exhibits the sensitivity of mechanical stress of plants the changes in plant form due to mechanical disturbances is called thigmomorphogenesis during evolution some plant species have become touch specialists climbing plants have tendrils that coil rapidly around support tendril usually grows straight until it touches a support the contact stimulates differential growth on opposite sides of the tendril the directional growth of tendril towards support is called thigmotropism other touch specialists respond to touch by rapid leaf movements eg mimosa pudica collapses its leaflets when touched touching results in a sudden loss of turgor of cells in a specialized motor organ called pulvini causing the leaflets to collapse this response is called thigmonasty,plants respond to various stimuli through mechanisms like photomorphogenesis which involves light triggering growth and development key aspects include light reception plants use photoreceptors specifically bluelight receptors and phytochromes to detect light direction intensity and wavelength influencing processes like seed germination phototropism and flowering gravitropism roots exhibit positive gravitropism growing downwards while shoots display negative gravitropism growing upwards this response is facilitated by statoliths specialized plastids that help plants sense gravity thigmomorphogenesis mechanical stimuli affect plant growth leading to shorter stockier trunks in windy environments thigmotropism refers to the growth of climbing plants tendrils towards support while thigmonasty describes rapid leaf movements as seen in mimosa pudica when touched these adaptations enable plants to optimize their growth and survival in response to their environment
hormones in general are signaling molecules which are produced in small quantities get transported from the place they are produced to other parts of the organism and trigger responses in target cells orand effect on plant growth and development with this definition its hard to explain some physiological processes in plants in addition some signaling molecules that are considered as plant hormones act locally thus the broader term plant growth regulators seem more appropriate plant growth regulators are natural or synthetic organic compounds which modify or control specific physiological process in plants plant biologists prefer to use the term plant growth regulators rather than plant hormones as there are certain differences in plant hormones and animal hormones therefore plant hormones and plant growth substances are considered as equal but plant hormones are active even at very low concentration major types of plant hormones growth regulators are auxins gibberlin cytokinin abscisic acid ethylene and jasmonate jasmonic acid plant hormones play key roles in regulating growth development and responses to environmental stimuli auxin is crucial for several processes including stimulating stem elongation at low concentrations promoting the formation of lateral and adventitious roots regulating fruit development enhancing apical dominance and contributing to both phototropism and gravitropism it also promotes vascular differentiation and delays leaf abscission gibberellins primarily stimulate stem elongation pollen development and pollen tube growth they are also involved in fruit growth seed development and germination while regulating sex determination and the transition from juvenile to adult phases in plants cytokinins regulate cell division in shoots and roots modify apical dominance by promoting lateral bud growth facilitate nutrient movement into sink tissues stimulate seed germination and delay leaf senescence abscisic acid aba acts as a growth inhibitor and plays a significant role in promoting stomatal closure during drought stress it promotes seed dormancy inhibits early germination promotes leaf senescence and enhances desiccation tolerance ethylene is wellknown for promoting the ripening of fruit as well as promoting leaf abscission and inducing the triple response in seedlings which includes inhibition of stem elongation lateral expansion and horizontal growth ethylene also enhances senescence promotes root and root hair formation and induces flowering in the pineapple family response of plants to some biotic and abiotic stresses stress certain factors in the environment may have a potentially adverse effects on a plants survival growth and reproduction two types of stresses 1 abiotic stress 2 biotic stress response of plants to some biotic and abiotic stresses stress certain factors in the environment may have potentially adverse effects on plants survival growth and reproduction two types of stresses 3 abiotic stressdue to nonliving factors 4 biotic stress due to living factors abiotic stress among several common abiotic stresses following three stresses are discussed 1 drought stress 2 cold stress 3 salt stress 1 drought stress plants may wilt when water loss by transpiration exceeds water absorption prolonged drought may even kill a plant plants have control systems that enable them to cope with the drought water defi cit conditions water deficit stimulates increased synthesis and release of abscisic acid aba which acts on guard cell membrane closing stomata to reduce transpiration in grasses the leaves roll in to a tubelike shape which reduces the surface area to reduce transpiration some plants shed their leaves during seasonal drought 2cold stress when cell membrane cools below a critical temperature it looses its fluidity due to the lipids become locked in to crystalline structure this blocks the transport across the membrane and affects the function of the cell plants respond to cold stress by altering the lipid composition of their membranes they increase the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids which keeps the membranes more fluid at low temperature freezing is another cold stress water in the cell wall and intercellular spaces freezes before freezing the soluterich water in the cytosol the reduction of liquid water in the cell wall lowers the extracellular water potential causing water in the cytosol to leave this results high concentration of solutes in the cytoplasm which is harmful and may lead to cell death before the onset of winter the cell of frosttolerant plants increases cytoplasmic levels of specific solutes such as sugars that help to reduce the loss of water from the cell preventing dehydration 3 salt stress an excess of salts high salinity in soil lowers the water potential of soil resulting reduced water potential gradient from soil to root this leads to reduction of water uptake by roots in general too high salinity in soil is toxic to plants many plants can respond to moderate soil salinity by producing solutes that are well tolerated at high concentrations these are organic compounds that keep the water potential of cell more negative than that of the soil solution a few plants that are salttolerant halophytes have developed salt glands which secrete excess salts out of the plant across leaf surfaces eg many mangrove plants biotic stress how plants defend themselves against pest and pathogens attack in plant defense mechanisms some compounds and structures are already existed whilst some others are formed after infection or pest attack therefore two categories of defense mechanisms called preexisting and induced mechanisms can be identified preexisting structural and chemical defense mechanisms amount and quality of wax and cuticle that cover the epidermal cells the structure of the epidermal cell walls and thickness the size location and shapes of stomata toxic compounds alkaloids eg nicotine phenolics eg flavonoids lignin tannins terpenoids eg azadirachtin and lectin thorns pricks trichromes induced structural and chemical defense mechanisms morphological changes in the cell wall formation of cork and abscission layers phenolic compounds toxic compounds enzymes that can degrade fungal cell walls or damage insect organs,plant hormones also known as plant growth regulators are signaling molecules that control physiological processes in plants the major types of plant hormones include auxins stimulate stem elongation root formation and regulate phototropism and gravitropism gibberellins promote stem elongation pollen development and seed germination cytokinins regulate cell division apical dominance and delay leaf senescence abscisic acid aba inhibits growth promotes stomatal closure during drought and induces seed dormancy ethylene promotes fruit ripening leaf abscission and the triple response in seedlings plants also respond to abiotic stresses eg drought cold and salt and biotic stresses eg pests and pathogens through various defense mechanisms abiotic stress responses drought increases aba to close stomata cold alters lipid composition for membrane fluidity salt produces solutes to maintain water potential biotic stress defenses involve preexisting structural and induced chemical defense mechanisms including toxic compounds and morphological changes
there are four major types of animal tissues epithelial tissue connective tissue muscle tissue and nervous tissue 1 epithelial tissue characteristics it covers external or internal free surfaces and organs the cells of the tissues are closely packed cells of epithelial tissue have both apical and basal surfaces where apical surface remains free and the basal surface attached to the basement membrane no blood vessels in the tissue tissue gets nutrients and oxygen from the underneath connective tissue functions protection eg barrier against mechanical injury pathogens barrier against fluid loss secretion eg enzymes hormones mucus sweat absorption eg nutrients respiratory gases there are two general types according to the number of cell layers on the basement membrane simple epithelia single cell layer eg simple squamous simple cuboidal simple columnar and pseudostratified compound epithelia several cell layers eg stratified squamous transitional simple squamous epithelium it is a single layer with plate like cells this type of epithelium is thin and leaky they are found in places where materials exchange by diffusion eg blood capillaries alveoli simple cuboidal epithelium it is a single cell layer with dice shaped cells specialized for secretion it is found in kidney tubules many glands such as thyroid glands and salivary glands simple columnar epithelium it is a single layer with large and brickshaped cells it is often found in places where secretion or active absorption is important eg intestinal lining pseudostratified columnar epithelium this tissue consists of a single cell layer cells are not of equal height nuclei of cells are located at different level appear as several layers in many vertebrates this epithelium has ciliated cells that form a mucous membrane and the cilia help to sweep the mucous along the surface eg nasal passage trachea compound epithelia stratified squamous epithelium this tissue is composed of a number of layers of cells this epithelium regenerates rapidly cell division produces new cells near the basement membrane the old cells are sloughed off and replaced by the new cells this epithelium is found on surfaces where they are subjected to abrasion such as outer skin lining of mouth anus vagina,animal tissues are classified into four major types epithelial connective muscle and nervous tissue epithelial tissue characteristics covers surfaces closely packed cells has apical and basal surfaces lacks blood vessels and obtains nutrients from underlying connective tissue functions protection acts as a barrier against injury and pathogens secretion produces substances like enzymes hormones and mucus absorption takes in nutrients and gases types simple epithelia single layer eg simple squamous cuboidal columnar and pseudostratified compound epithelia multiple layers eg stratified squamous transitional examples simple squamous found in blood capillaries and alveoli for diffusion simple cuboidal found in kidney tubules and glands for secretion simple columnar found in the intestinal lining for absorption pseudostratified columnar found in the trachea and nasal passage with cilia for mucus movement stratified squamous found in skin and mucosal linings regenerates rapidly to replace wornout cells

muscle tissue is responsible for movement the cells in the muscle tissue are composed of actin and myosin proteins this tissue is able to contract and relax there are three basic types of muscle tissues found in the vertebrate animal body they are smooth muscle skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle tissues smooth muscle tissue the cells of the smooth muscle tissue are spindle shaped and uninucleated cells lack striations this tissue is responsible for involuntary body functions eg churning of stomach constriction of arteries this tissue is found in digestive tract urinary bladder arteries and other internal organs skeletal muscle tissue they are composed of bundles of long cells with multi nuclei cells are striated the contractile units of this muscle cells are called sarcomers this gives the striated appearance to the muscle cells the arrangement of the sarcomere gives the striated appearance the muscles are generally attached to the skeletal system and helps mainly in voluntary body movements cardiac muscle tissue they are composed of uninucleated cells which are interconnected via intercalated discs cells are striated with sarcomeres cardiac muscle tissue is responsible for involuntary heart contractions intercalated disks help relay signals from cell to cell and synchronize heart contraction cardiac muscle tissue is only found in the wall of the heart 4 nervous tissue nervous tissue contains neurons and glial cells neurons receive process and transmit nerve impulses neuroglia glial cells support the neurons neurons a neuron has cell body dendrites and axon the basic structural unit of the nervous system is the neuron dendrites and cell body is used to receive nerve impulses from other neurons axon is used to transmit impulses to other neurons cells or muscles axons are bundled together into nerves neuroglia glial cells neuroglial cells are supportive cells of neurons their functions include nourishment of nerve cells insulation of nerve cells replenishing neurons and sometimes modulate neuron functions,muscle tissue is essential for movement and is composed of cells containing the proteins actin and myosin allowing contraction and relaxation there are three primary types of muscle tissue in vertebrates smooth muscle tissue composed of spindleshaped uninucleated cells that lack striations it is responsible for involuntary functions such as digestion and blood vessel constriction found in organs like the digestive tract and arteries skeletal muscle tissue consists of long striated cells with multiple nuclei forming bundles these muscles are attached to the skeleton and facilitate voluntary movements through contractile units called sarcomeres cardiac muscle tissue composed of striated uninucleated cells interconnected by intercalated discs it is found only in the heart and is responsible for involuntary contractions ensuring synchronized heartbeat nervous tissue includes neurons and glial cells neurons the fundamental units consist of a cell body dendrites for receiving signals and an axon for transmitting impulses glial cells support neurons by nourishing insulating and replenishing them
animal nutrition is the process by which food is taken in for make use in different body functions typically food is broken into smaller molecules and absorbed prior to utilization animals are heterotrophs heterptrophic nutrition is the process by which the organisms obtain organic food molecules by ingesting other organisms or by substances derived from other organisms other than animals fungi and majority of bacteria are heterotrophs there are two type of heterotrophic nutrition namely holozoic nutrition and symbiosis holozoic nutrition most animals are holozoic where they ingest food into their alimentary canal this mode of nutrition consists of five main stages ingestion digestion absorption assimilation and elimination egestion main stages in holozoic nutrition ingestion this is the first stage where the act of eating or feeding happens food sources differ among animal species and they possess different modes of ingestion according to the diet or environment digestion food is broken down into molecules small enough to pass through the membranes and enter the cells of organisms digestion could occur mechanically by teeth or muscle contractions and chemically by enzymes during mechanical digestion food is broken down in to smaller fragments thus increase the surface area for efficient chemical digestion during chemical digestion enzymes break bonds in large molecules into small molecules the last two stages of food processing occur after the food is digested absorption in this stage the animals cells take up small molecules egsimple sugars amino acids assimilation assimilation is the process of utilization of absorbed nutrients for various functions of the body elimination in this process undigested materials are passed out from the alimentary canal feeding mechanisms of animals filter feeders they strain suspended food particles from the surrounding watery medium they use several mechanisms such as capturing trapping etc eg clams and oysters feed on small pieces of food in the water that passes over their gills cilia in the gills sweep the food particles to the animals mouth in a film of mucus fluid feeders they suck nutrient rich fluid from a living host using well adapted mouth parts eg mosquitoessuck human blood aphids suck phloem sap of plants bees and humming birds suck honey from flowers substrate feeders these animals live inside their food source or on the food source eating its way through the food eg the leaf miner caterpillar eating through the soft tissues of a leaf maggots fly larvae burrow into animal carcasses bulk feeders animals which eat comparatively large pieces of food these animals have different types of adaptations to tear the food or to capture the pray eg jaws teeth tentacles claws poisonous fangs eg most animals including human symbiosis this is an ecological relationship between organisms of two different species that live closely together it is divided into three groups such as mutualism parasitism and commensalism mutualism it is a close association between two living organisms of different species which benefits both partners e g cellulose digesting microorganisms in ruminants and termites parasitism it is a close association between two living organisms of different species which is beneficial to one parasite and harmful to the other host parasites live either within or on the host and derive its nourishment eg tape worm and humans lice and humans commensalism it is a close association between two living organisms of different species which is beneficial to one and does not affect the other neither harmful or beneficial eg barnacles attached to whales,animal nutrition is the process through which animals as heterotrophs obtain food to support various body functions heterotrophic nutrition can be classified into two main types holozoic nutrition and symbiosis holozoic nutrition involves five stages
structure and function of the human digestive system human alimentary canal is a long tube tract which connects with external environment and can fulfill steps of holozoic mode of nutrition human digestive system consists of alimentary canal and associated glands the alimentary canal consists of the following parts oral cavity pharynx esophagus stomach small intestine large intestine rectum and anus the associated glands include salivary glands pancreas and liver mouth oral cavity oral cavity consists of the tongue teeth and salivary glands ingestion and initial steps of digestion are carried out in the oral cavity in the mouth both mechanical and chemical digestion is carried out there are four types of teeth in the mouth incisors canines premolars and molars food is cut mashed and ground by different types of teeth with different shapes this makes it easier to swallow food and increase the surface area for digestion salivary glands release saliva into the oral cavity through ducts releasing saliva into the oral cavity occurs when food enters the oral cavity due to a nervous reflex saliva is also released into the mouth before food is ingested due to various other stimuli eg sight odor of food etc saliva contains water amylase mucus a viscous mixture of salts cells and slippery glycoprotein called mucins in addition to that saliva composed of buffers and anti microbial components functions of the saliva salivary amylase chemical digestion of polysaccharides eg starch into smaller polysaccharides and disaccharide maltose water liquefy food and provide watery medium for chemical digestion aids in taste reception mucus lubrication of food which makes it easier for swallowing clean the mouth and protects the lining of the mouth from abrasion antimicrobial substances such as immunoglobulin and lysozymes protect against bacteria that enter the mouth buffers prevent tooth decay by neutralizing acid tongue composed of skeletal muscles helps to mix the food with saliva and make bolus of food that makes easier for swallowing then helps to push the bolus into the posterior part of the oral cavity and into the pharynx pharynx a common passage of the respiratory tract and the digestive tract the pharynx leads to the esophagus esophagus it is a long tube which connects the pharynx and the stomach it is found in the thoracic cavity the wall of the esophagus consists of both skeletal and smooth muscles the skeletal muscles are located towards the uppermost part of the esophagus and these muscles function during swallowing the rest of the esophagus consists of smooth muscles which are involved in the process called peristalsis during this process the food bolus is pushed along the esophagus which is a alternative wave of rhythmic contractions and relaxations of the smooth muscles lining the esophagus stomach the stomach is a j shaped dilated sac in the abdominal cavity the inner surface of the stomach is highly folded and contains large number of pits that leads to gastric glands gastric glands contain three types of cells mucus cells chief cells and parietal cells the stomach wall is very elastic distal part of the stomach connects with the small intestine sphincters are found at the junctions between esophagus and stomach cardiac sphincter and stomach and the small intestinepyloric sphincter they are made up of circular smooth muscles these sphincters help to regulate the passage of materials between these organs chemical digestion in the stomach the gastric glands of the stomach secrete gastric juice the gastric juice mainly consists of mucus pepsinogen and hcl mucus and pepsinogen inactive form of pepsin are secreted by mucous cells and chief cells respectively the parietal cells release hydrogen ions and chloride ions separately into the stomach lumen where hcl is formed pepsinogen is initially converted into pepsin by hcl these activated pepsin help to activate remaining pepsinogen molecules this activated pepsin initiates the chemical digestion of proteins in the stomach the churning action of the stomach facilitates the chemical digestion this is a series of muscle contraction and relaxation this process mixes the swallowed food with gastric juice proteins are hydrolyzed to small polypeptides by pepsin in the stomach food is mixed with gastric juice forming chyme partially digested semisolid acidic food mass the stomach lining is protected from the digestion of hcl and pepsin in several ways enzymes are secreted in to the lumen as an inactive enzyme gastric glands secrete mucus that protect against selfdigestion of the stomach lining every three days cell division adds a new epithelial cell layer which replaces the destroyed damaged cells in the lining of the stomach functions of the stomach act as a temporary reservoir for food due to high convolution and very elastic wall mechanical digestion of food by churning action due to muscular contraction produce gastric juice which starts the chemical digestion of proteins to polypeptide by pepsin absorption of some materials such as water alcohol and some drugs non specific defensehcl kills microbes small jets of gastric contents push out through pyloric sphincter as chyme secretion of gastrin hormone which regulates digestion in the stomach,the human digestive system consists of the alimentary canal and associated glands facilitating the steps of holozoic nutrition the alimentary canal includes the oral cavity pharynx esophagus stomach small intestine large intestine rectum and anus while associated glands comprise the salivary glands pancreas and liver key components and functions oral cavity involves ingestion and initial digestion utilizing teeth for mechanical breakdown and saliva for chemical digestion saliva contains salivary amylase breaks down polysaccharides mucus lubricates food for swallowing buffers neutralize acids to prevent tooth decay esophagus connects the pharynx to the stomach using both skeletal and smooth muscles for peristalsis which pushes food down stomach a jshaped sac where further digestion occurs it secretes gastric juice mucus pepsinogen hcl that initiates protein digestion the stomach protects itself from damage through secreting inactive enzymes producing protective mucus regular cell turnover functions of the stomach include temporary food storage mechanical digestion chemical digestion of proteins and nonspecific defense against microbes
it is the longest organ in the alimentary canal it is divided into three regions duodenum jejunum and ileum the duodenum c shaped curve around the head of the pancreas the jejunum is middle part of the small intestine the ileum is the terminal part of the small intestine the surface area of the small intestine is greatly increased by permanent circular folds and villi the villi are tiny finger like projections of the intestinal wall most of the digestion is completed in the duodenum the major sites for nutrient absorption are jejunum and ileum chemical digestion in the small intestine small intestine receives chyme from the stomach peristaltic contractions aid the receiving of this chyme pyloric sphincter regulate the passing of chyme into the small intestine the chyme is mixed with secretions of glands in intestinal wall and secretions of pancreas and liver refer pages no 169170 the epithelium of the duodenum secretes several digestive enzymes glands of the intestinal wall secrete enzymes such as disaccharidases dipeptidases carboxypeptidases aminopeptidases nucleotidases nucleosidases and phosphotases some of these enzymes are secreted to the lumen and others are bound to the surface of the epithelium two hormones namely cholecystokonin and secretin secreted by duodenum stimulates the release of pancreatic juice and the bile pancreatic juice contains enzymes such as trypsin chymotrypsin pancreatic amylase pancreatic carboxypeptidases pancreatic nucleases and pancreatic lipases in addition it also contains bicarbonates the liver secretes bile which is stored in the gall bladder until released into the duodenum carbohydarte digestion pancreatic amylase catalyze the conversion of polysaccharides eg starch into disaccharides intestinal disaccharidases catalyze the conversion of disaccharides into monosaccharides protein digestion tripsin and chymotripsin catalyse the conversion of small polypeptides into smaller polypeptides these smaller polypeptides are converted to small peptides and amino acids by the catalytic action of panceratic carboxypeptidases proteases secreted by the intestinal epithelium dipeptidases carboxypeptidases and aminopeptidases catalyse the conversion of small peptides into amino acids fat digestion digestion of fats triglycerides starts in the small intestine first bile salts emulsify fats next pancreatic lipase catalyse the conversion of these fats into fatty acids glycerol and monoglycerides protein digestion tripsin and chymotripsin catalyse the conversion of small polypeptides into smaller polypeptides these smaller polypeptides are converted to small peptides and amino acids by the catalytic action of panceratic carboxypeptidases proteases secreted by the intestinal epithelium dipeptidases carboxypeptidases and aminopeptidases catalyse the conversion of small peptides into amino acids fat digestion digestion of fats triglycerides starts in the small intestine first bile salts emulsify fats next pancreatic lipase catalyse the conversion of these fats into fatty acids glycerol and monoglycerides nucleic acid digestion digestion of nucleic acids start in the small intestine pancreatic nucleases catalyse the conversion of dna and rna into nucleotides these nucleotides are eventually converted into nitrogenous bases sugars and phosphates by the catalytic action of intestinal nucleotidases nucleosidases and phosphatases absorption in the small intestine for effective absorption the surface area of the intestinal wall has been increased with three structural modifications heavy permanent foldings finger like projections called villi in the intestinal wall and finger like microscopic projections called microvilli in the epithelial cells of the villi these micro villi are exposed into the intestinal lumen it gives the appearance of brush brush border transport of the nutrients across the epithelium may be active or passive for example fructose is absorbed by facilitated diffusion amino acids small peptides vitamins and most glucose molecules are actively transported into the epithelial cells then these nutrients from the epithelial cells are transported into the blood capillaries in the villi those blood capillaries are converged into the hepatic portal veins these nutrients are carried in to the liver via the hepatic portal veins from the liver this nutrient filled blood is transported into the tissues but absorption of some products of fat digestion takes place in a different pathway fatty acids and monoglycerides are absorbed into the cell through microvilli within the cells triglycerides are reformed and they are incooperated into water soluble globules called chylomicrons these chylomicrons are transported into the lacteal and then into the blood vessels through lymph then they are transported throughout the body via the circulatory system in addition to nutrient absorption recovery of water and ions mostly occur in the small intestine in addition to the water intake about 2 l digestive juices add more water about 7 l into the small intestine most of this water is reabsorbed via osmosis large intestine the large intestine is the terminal end of the alimentary canal it is divided into three regions colon proximal part cecum and rectum the small intestine is connected to the large intestine at a t shaped junction one arm of the t junction is colon and the other arm is a small pouch called cecum a finger like projection in the cecum is called the appendix the colon leads to the rectum and anus cecum is important for fermentation of indigested materials by microbes especially in animals that eat large amount of plant matter functions of the large intestine the colon completes the reabsorption of water synthesize some vitamin b complexes vitamin k and folic acid with the help of microbes and move feces consists of undigested matter such as fibres along the colon by peristalsis the rectum stores feces until they are eliminated presence of two sphincters between the rectum and anus can regulate feces movement strong contractions in the colon trigger the defecation,the small intestine the longest organ in the alimentary canal consists of three regions duodenum jejunum and ileum it plays a vital role in digestion and nutrient absorption key functions include chemical digestion chyme from the stomach is mixed with secretions from the pancreas and liver enzymes like trypsin and pancreatic amylase break down proteins and carbohydrates while bile salts emulsify fats nutrient absorption the intestinal wall features folds villi and microvilli to enhance surface area nutrients are absorbed through active or passive transport into blood capillaries while fats are absorbed into cells as chylomicrons large intestine comprising the colon cecum and rectum it completes water reabsorption synthesizes vitamins and stores feces for elimination
pancreas histological structure of pancreas the pancreas is a pale grey gland which consists of a broad head a body and a narrow tail head is in the curve of the duodenum pancreas is both an exocrine and endocrine gland the exocrine part consists of a large number of lobules made up of small acini the walls of which consist of secretary cells each lobule is drained by a tiny duct and these unite eventually to form the pancreatic duct which joins with bile duct to form hepato pancreatic duct and opens into the duodenum at its midpoint exocrine part of the pancreas secretes pancreatic juice the components of the pancreatic juice are bicarbonate carbohydrate digesting enzymes pancreatic amylase pancreatic lipase nucleases and inactive form of protein digesting enzymestrpsinogen and chymotrypsinogen these inactive enzymes are converted to active enzymestrypsin and chymotrypsin upon secretion into the lumen of the duodenum endocrine part of the pancreas is the islets of langerhans which consist of group of specialized cells they do not have ducts islets of langerhans secrete hormones glucagan and insulin which are involved in glucose homeostasis liver liver is the largest gland in the body its upper and anterior surfaces are smooth and convex its posterior surface is irregular in outline liver contains four lobes each lobe is made up of tiny hexagonal shape lobules which are the functional unit these lobules are made up of cuboidal cells called hepatocytes which are arranged in pairs of columns radiating from a central vein between two pairs of column of cells there are sinusoids blood vessels with incomplete walls containing mixture of blood from the tiny branches of the portal vein and hepatic artery this arrangement allows venous blood high concentration of nutritional materials to mix with arterial blood and come into close contact with liver cells hepatic macrophages kupffer cells are found in the lining of the sinusoids blood drains from the sinusoids into central veins which joins with veins from the other lobules forming larger veins and eventually the hepatic vein fi g 512 bile canaliculi run between columns of liver cells canaliculi join up to form larger bile canals in the corner of the hexagonal structure a branch of hepatic artery a branch of the hepatic portal vein and intra lobular bile duct can be found liver is a vital organ that performs many important functions in addition to its role in food digestion it is also perform functions such as metabolism of carbohydrates fats and proteins detoxification of drugs and toxic substances defense against microbes some hormone inactivation and heat production function of liver related to digestion the liver secretes bile which is stored in the gall bladder until released into the duodenum the bile contains bile salts which act as emulsifiers that help in fat digestion and absorption most of the absorbed nutrients reach the liver and it regulates the distribution of nutrients to the rest of the body excess glucose is stored as glycogen in the liver cells glycogen deposition and break down in the liver cells are regulated by insulin and glucagon hormones fat soluble vitamins ade and k and some water soluble vitamins b12 iron and copper are also stored in liver regulation of digestion in man digestion in man is regulated by two ways nervous regulation and endocrine regulation nervous regulation is mainly by nervous reflexes for example nervous reflex stimulates the release of saliva when food reach the mouth arrival of food in the stomach trigger churning and release of gastric juices endocrine system plays a critical role in digestion especially in the stomach and small intestine when food arrives the stomach the stomach wall is stretched this triggers to release the hormone gastrin gastrin circulates via the blood stream and arrives the stomach then gastrin stimulates the production of gastric juice at the stomach fatty acids and amino acids in the chyme trigger the release of cholecystokinin and secretin from the duodenum cholecystokinin triggers release of bile from the gall bladder and digestive enzymes from the pancreas secretin stimulates the release of bicarbonate from the pancreas bicarbonate neutralize the chyme received from the stomach when the chyme is rich in fat food digestion in the stomach slows down due to high levels of cholecystokinin and secretin secreted by duodenum these hormones act on the stomach and inhibit peristalsis and gastric juice secretion,the pancreas is a gland with both exocrine and endocrine functions its exocrine component consists of lobules made of acini that secrete pancreatic juice containing bicarbonate enzymes for carbohydrate and fat digestion pancreatic amylase lipase and inactive proteindigesting enzymes trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen the endocrine part islets of langerhans secretes hormones like glucagon and insulin for glucose regulation the liver the bodys largest gland has four lobes and is composed of functional units called lobules made of hepatocytes it plays a crucial role in digestion by producing bile which emulsifies fats and regulates nutrient distribution storing excess glucose as glycogen regulation of digestion occurs through nervous regulation reflexes stimulate salivation and gastric juice release endocrine regulation hormones like gastrin stimulates gastric juice cholecystokinin triggers bile release and secretin stimulates bicarbonate release manage digestive processes
the balanced diet contains the all essential nutrients required for health in the appropriate proportions essential components of the balanced diet contain carbohydrates proteins lipids fibers minerals vitamins and water carbohydrates and lipids supply energy energy requirements vary with age sex body size and activity twenty amino acids are needed to synthesize proteins in the body most of these amino acids are synthesized within the body they are known as non essential amino acids eg alanine cystine etc other amino acids eg lysine and histidine etc must be obtained from the diet as they cant be synthesized within the body they are called essential amino acids animal proteins contain all the essential amino acids in proper proportions however most plant proteins lack one or more essential amino acids therefore vegetarian based diet requires several sources of plant proteins to obtain all the essential amino acids components of foods and their functions carbohydrates proteins lipids vitamins mineral elements water fibers carbohydrates carbohydrates are sugars and polysaccharides they can be found in a variety of foods such as rice bread biscuits cereals hoppers etc during digestion most carbohydrates are broken down into monosaccharides which are absorbed into blood stream functions of digestible carbohydrates provide energy and heat breakdown of carbohydrates provides atp for body functions and generates heat act as an energy stores eg excess carbohydrates are converted into glycogen and fat facilitates protein sparing proteins are not used to get energy when there is an adequate carbohydrates in the food proteins proteins are made up of amino acids during the digestion proteins are broken down into amino acids and absorbed into the blood stream the amino acids are grouped into two groups ie essential amino acids and non essential amino acids these essential amino acids cannot be synthesized in the body therefore they should be obtained into the body through the diet the non essential amino acids can be synthesized within the body therefore it is not necessary to obtain them through the diet functions of proteins in the diet the amino acids which are supplied from proteins are used for growth and repair of body cells and tissues are used for synthesis of plasma proteins enzymes antibodies and some hormones act as an energy source for body functions lipids lipids in the diet are mainly composed of fats and oils fatty acids are composed of fats and oils fatty acids can be grouped as essential and non essential fatty acids essential fatty acids cannot be synthesized within the body while the non essential fatty acids can be synthesized within the body therefore essential fatty acids should be obtained through the food functions of lipids in the diet provide energy and heat on weight basis fats and oils provide more energy compared to carbohydrates and proteins help in transport and storage of fat soluble vitamins such as vitamin a d e and k store energy as fat in the adipose tissues help to synthesize steroid hormones from cholesterol provide insulation eg fat found in subcutaneous layer in the skin reduces heat loss constituents of myelin sheath of neurons vitamins vitamins are organic compounds required in small amounts for the maintenance of normal health and metabolism vitamins cannot be produced in the body and therefore should be provided in the diet if the vitamins are insufficiently taken into the body that may lead to the deficiency diseases vitamins are two types they are fat soluble vitamins vitamin a d e and k and water soluble vitamins vitamin b and c main functions of vitamins vitamin a form visual pigments in the eye epithelial tissue maintenance promotion of growth and immunity vitamin b components of coenzymes such as fad and nad promote red blood cell production vitamin c act as an antioxidant used in collagen synthesis vitamin d aids in absorption and use of calcium and phosphorous vitamin e act as an antioxidant vitamin k important in blood clotting minerals minerals are inorganic substances and they are also important for normal health and many body functions major mineral elements needed by humans are ca p s k cl na mg fe f and i in addition minerals needed in trace amounts include co cu mn mo se and zn main functions of minerals include ca form bones and teeth helps clotting blood and nerve and muscle function p form bones and teeth help maintain in acid base balance s components of some amino acids k help maintain in acid base balance and water balance nerve function cl help maintain in acid base balance maintain osmotic balance nerve function na help maintain in acid base balance and water balance nerve function mg act as enzyme cofactor fe components of hemoglobin and electron carriers act as an enzyme cofactor f maintenance of tooth structure i component of thyroid hormone water water accounts for around 60 of the body mass in humans normally water is lost through urine sweating and feces therefore amount of water in the body should be balanced within the body this water can be taken in to the body by drinking and via foods functions of water in human body provides the moist internal environment for all living cells major component of blood and tissue fluid therefore helps to transport materials around the body and to exchange materials between blood and tissues and body cells regulate body temperature mainly through evaporative cooling dilute waste products and toxins and provide a medium for their excretion moisten the food and that make easier to swallow fibres dietary fibres non starch polysaccharides are made up of indigestible polysaccharides in the diet fibres are rich in fruit vegetable and cereals functions of dietary fibres provide bulk to the diet and satisfy the appetite prevent constipation by attracting water to increase faecal bulk and stimulating peristalsis leading to defecation adequate fibres in the diet protect against some gastrointestinal disorders such as cancers in the colon and rectum,a balanced diet contains essential nutrients necessary for health in appropriate proportions including carbohydrates provide energy and heat stored as glycogen or fat and spare proteins for energy use proteins made up of amino acids essential amino acids must be obtained through diet proteins support growth repair body tissues and act as energy sources lipids include fats and oils which provide energy and aid in the transport of fatsoluble vitamins essential fatty acids must be included in the diet vitamins organic compounds needed in small amounts deficiencies can lead to diseases types include fatsoluble a d e k and watersoluble b c minerals inorganic substances required for various body functions examples include calcium ca iron fe and iodine i water constitutes about 60 of body mass regulates temperature transports materials and facilitates waste excretion fibers nondigestible polysaccharides that aid in digestion prevent constipation and reduce the risk of gastrointestinal disorders
essential nutrients are the substances that cannot be synthesized in the body from simple precursors and must therefore be taken through the diet these essential nutrients include essential amino acids essential fatty acids vitamins and minerals essential nutrients have key functions in bio synthetic reaction in the body cells if these essential nutrients are not supplied in correct proportions in the diet that will lead to malnutrition therefore it is essential to obtain them in correct amounts essential amino acids essential amino acids are the amino acids that must be obtained from the food since they cannot be synthesized within the body from organic precursor molecules of the 20 amino acids required to make proteins in the body 8 amino acids are essential amino acids examples for essential amino acids are leucine and methionine the animal protein products eg eggs meat cheese etc will provide all essential amino acids in correct proportions required for body functions most plant proteins are incomplete as they are deficient in one or more amino acids therefore vegetarian diet should contain a variety of plant proteins in order to obtain all the essential amino acids required essential fatty acids essential fatty acids are the fatty acids that should be obtained from the diet since they cannot be synthesized in the body from organic precursors seeds

energy expenditure for metabolism and excretion are available for production which includes growth and reproduction energy budget can be calculated for each animal based on energy measurements from fi eld and laboratory energy budgets are useful for estimating energy available for growth and reproduction food for healthy life for a healthy life diet should contain correct proportions of carbohydrates proteins lipids water fiber essential mineral elements and vitamins dietary deficiencies can have negative impact on health when food intake exceeds daily energy requirements especially in inactive individuals can lead to ill health conditions specially diabetes mellitus and heart diseases some individuals develop allergic reactions to foods such as pineapple peanuts and tomatoes such individuals should avoid these types of foods antioxidants present in the food material eg vitamin c and vitamin e are also important in avoiding disorders in the alimentary canal and maintaining a healthy life as humans cannot synthesize all the required antioxidants some of them should be obtained from the diet malnutrition malnutrition can arise due to failure of obtaining an adequate nutrition when the diet lacks one or more essential nutrients or consistently supplies less chemical energy than the energy required by the body according to the who if body mass index bmi is less than 185 is said to be malnutrition bmi of a person is calculated as follows bmi mass height2 kg m2 obesity obesity arises when energy expenditure of a person is much less than the energy intake according to the who criteria if the bmi is at 300 or over it is known as obesity this condition is a growing issue worldwide obesity can lead to many diseases such as diabetes mellitus cardiovascular diseases some cancers etc common disorders in the alimentary canal gastritis gastritis is a condition resulting inflammation of the stomach which can be due to several reasons in gastritis glands of the stomach wall are stimulated and secrete excess hcl causing damage to the mucosa due to the damages of mucosa layer of the stomach blisters can be formed prolonged starvation and mental stress are one of the reasons for the secretion of excess hcl some drugs like aspirin can also induce gastritis conditions longer lasting gastritis conditions is usually associated with the infection by the acid tolerance bacterium helicobacter pylori as prolonged starvation is one of the reasons for developing gastritis proper food habits should be practiced to control this condition constipation constipation occurs due to the slow movement of feces that promotes the water reabsorption and as a result feces become more solid inhibition of the reflex action in defecation may also leads to constipation this leads to pain in the anus and difficulty in defecating constipation can be controlled by developing behavioral adjustments to carry out defecation properly intake of adequate fiber in the diet can help prevent constipation,essential nutrients are substances that cannot be synthesized by the body and must be obtained through diet including essential amino acids essential fatty acids vitamins and minerals malnutrition can occur from inadequate intake of these nutrients leading to health issues such as obesity and dietary deficiencies key vitamins and their sources fatsoluble vitamins vitamin a sources include dark green and orange vegetables deficiency can cause blindness vitamin d found in egg yolk and dairy deficiency can lead to rickets watersoluble vitamins thiamine b1 present in legumes and grains deficiency leads to beriberi cobalamin b12 found in dairy and meat deficiency results in anemia minerals calcium sources include dairy deficiency affects bone health iron found in leafy vegetables and meats deficiency causes anemia basal metabolic rate bmr is the minimum metabolic rate at rest averaging 16001800 kcal for males and 13001500 kcal for females maintaining an energy budget energy intake vs expenditure is crucial for growth and reproduction good nutrition including the right balance of nutrients is essential for a healthy life
need of a circulatory system a circulatory system is required in animals for transportation of materials within the body and exchange of materials with the external environment the simple animals eg cnidarians flat worms lack specialized system for the transport and distribution of material because many or all cells are in direct contact with the external environment in these animals exchange of materials over the body surface through direct diffusion is sufficient for their needs in these animals those materials can be transported by diffusion through short distance within the body as organisms increase in size and complexity the amount of materials moving in and out of the body also increases the distance that materials have to be transported within the body also increases and many cells are not in direct contact with their external environment therefore diffusion is not sufficient to transport materials throughout the body therefore circulatory systems have evolved in such organisms to exchange materials between cells and their immediate surroundings substances that are transported in the body substances that are transported in the body include respiratory gases oxygen carbon dioxide nutrients glucose amino acids fatty acids vitamins etc waste products of metabolism urea ammonia etc hormones and antibodies blood circulatory systems in the animal kingdom a circulatory system has three basic components a muscular pumping device heart interconnected vessels and a circulatory fluid blood hemolymph circulatory fluid flows through the vessels mainly due to the pressure generated by the heart the circulatory system functionally connects the fluid environment of the body cells to the organs that exchange gases absorb nutrients and dispose of wastes by transporting fluids throughout the body various degrees of complexity in the arrangement of circulatory systems can be seen in the animal kingdom main circulatory systems in the animal kingdom there are two types of circulatory systems among the animals open circulatory system and closed circulatory system the open circulatory system it is a circulatory system in which a fluid called hemolymph that bathes the tissues and organs directly there is no distinction between the circulatory fluid and the interstitial fluid surrounding cells the heart pumps hemolymph through the circulatory vessels into the spaces interconnected sinuses which surround body tissues chemical exchange occurs directly between the hemolymph and body cells back flow of the hemolymph takes place via the pores ostia with valves found in the heart during the relaxation the open circulatory system has evolved in some invertebrate phyla such as arthropoda and mollusca some mollusc groups the closed circulatory system it is a circulatory system in which blood is restricted to vessels and kept apart from the interstitial fluid blood is pumped by the hearts into large vessels these large blood vessels branches into small vessels and they penetrate into the organs chemical exchange occurs between the blood and the interstitial fluid and interstitial fluid and body cells it may contain one or more hearts this type of circulatory systems can be seen in vertebrates and invertebrates such as annelids in comparison to open circulatory system enable effective delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the cells of larger and more active animals due to relatively high blood pressure organization of vertebrate circulatory systems single circulation and double circulation vertebrates have a closed circulatory system where there are three main types of blood vessels arteries veins and capillaries within each type blood flows in only one direction the blood vessels which carry blood from the heart to organs are called arteries when these arteries branch into smaller vessels within organs they are called arterioles they pass blood to capillaries which are microscopic vessels with thin and porous walls these are the places where materials exchange occurs between blood and interstitial fluid surrounding body cells through diffusion capillaries converge into venules and they converge into veins which carry blood back to the heart single circulation during single circulation in a complete circulation through the entire body blood passes through the heart only once in animals that demonstrate single circulation posses two chambers in the heart they are atrium and ventricle during a single circulation the oxygen poor blood returning from the body enters atrium and pass into the ventricle then the ventricle is contracted blood is pumped into the capillary bed in the gills there gas exchange occurs between the capillaries and the external environment the o 2 is diffused into the blood while co2 is removed from the blood next the oxygen enriched blood circulates throughout the body and reaches the body cells through body capillaries eg bony fishes cartilagenous fi shes such as rays and sharks double circulation during double circulation in a complete circulation through the entire body blood passes through the heart twice such circulatory system consists of separate pulmonary and systemic circuits in which blood passes through the heart after completing each cycle eg amphibians reptiles aves mammals amphibians and most reptiles have a three chambered heart two atria and one ventricle birds and mammals have a four chambered heart where heart is completely divided into left and right sides this arrangement allows the complete separation of oxygen enriched and oxygen poor blood the oxygen poor blood from systemic circulation flows to the right atrium of the heart and then to the right ventricle right ventricle pumps blood into the lungs oxygen enriched blood from the lungs reaches the left atrium and pass to the left ventricle the left ventricle pumps oxygen enriched blood into the systemic circulation double circulation is more effective in supplying blood to all body organs and tissues especially brain and muscles due to the higher pressure exerted by the heart in the systemic circulation this in contrast to single circulation where blood flows under reduced pressure from the gas exchange organs to other organs,a circulatory system is essential for transporting materials in animals facilitating the exchange of substances between cells and the external environment simple organisms like cnidarians and flatworms rely on diffusion due to direct contact with the environment however larger and more complex organisms require specialized systems for efficient transport key components of circulatory systems open circulatory system hemolymph bathes organs directly found in arthropoda and some mollusca closed circulatory system blood circulates within vessels allowing for effective nutrient and gas exchange seen in vertebrates and annelids types of circulation in vertebrates single circulation blood passes through the heart once typical in bony fishes and sharks it consists of two heart chambers atrium and ventricle double circulation blood passes through the heart twice with separate pulmonary and systemic circuits observed in amphibians reptiles birds and mammals this system includes a more complex heart structure enabling higher blood pressure and efficient oxygen transport
basic plan of human blood circulatory system the human heart consists of four chambers they are two ventricles and two atria there is a dual circuit which operates simultaneously the pulmonary circuit takes oxygen poor blood to the respiratory surface the lungs and returns the oxygen enriched blood back to the heart while the systemic circuit supplies oxygen enriched blood to all organs and tissues in the body and returns oxygen poor blood from organ and tissues back to the heart each circuit consists of major arteries arteries arterioles capillary beds venules and veinsmajor veins during ventricular contraction the right ventricle pumps the oxygen poor blood into the two lungs via the pulmonary arteries then in the lungs o2 is loaded into the blood through diffusion while co2 is unloaded from blood into the external environment this process occurs in the capillary beds in the left and right lungs then the oxygen rich blood is transported into the left atrium via the two pulmonary veins during atrial contraction this oxygen rich blood is transported into the left ventricle during ventricular contraction oxygen rich blood is pumped into the aorta through arteries the aorta conveys this oxygen rich blood throughout the body first the aorta branches into the coronary arteries which supplies blood into the heart muscles then the aorta branches into arteries arterioles leading to capillary beds in the head and arms and the capillary beds in the abdominal organs and legs the exchange of gases occurs in the capillary beds where o2 rich blood is diffused into the tissues while the co2 rich blood diffused into the blood capillaries these blood capillaries rejoined to form venules which direct oxygen poor blood into veins oxygen poor blood from trunk and hind limbs is drained into the inferior vena cava and oxygen poor blood from the head neck and fore limbs are directed into the superior vena cava the blood from both inferior and superior vena cava is pumped into the right atrium where it is passed into the right ventricle this blood is directed to the pulmonary circuit as explained above basic plan of human lymphatic system the lymphatic system is closely connected with the blood circulatory system both structurally and functionally it consists of lymph vessels through which lymph travels other structure in the lymphatic system includes lymph nodes lymphoid tissues tonsils and lymphoid organs eg spleen and thymus lymph vessels consist of tiny vessels and larger vessels tiny lymph vessels are in close contact with the capillaries of the blood circulatory system lymph nodes are composed of connective tissues and white blood cells the lymphatic system returns lost fluid and proteins from the blood capillaries back into the blood the lost fluid from the blood capillaries is called lymph when they are inside the lymphatic system the composition of the lymph is same as interstitial fluid lymph vessels have valves that prevents the backflow of the lymph the lymph is drained into veins at the base of the neck via two large ducts the rhythmic contraction of the lymph vessel walls and skeletal muscle contraction help to move the lymph the functions of human lymphatic system include tissue drainage to maintain the blood volume in the blood circulatory system absorption of fat and fat soluble vitamins from the small intestine and for immune responses structure and function of the human heart the human heart is roughly a cone shaped hollow muscular organ the heart wall is composed of three layers of tissues pericardium myocardium endocardium pericardium the pericardium is the outer most layers it is made up of two sacs the outer fibrous pericardium and inner serous pericardium myocardium myocardium is the middle layer of the heart wall it is composed of specialized cardiac muscle found only in the heart running through the myocardium is also a network of specialized conducting fibres responsible for transmitting the hearts electrical signals enodocardium endocardium is the inner layer of the heart wall it lines the chambers and valves of the heart it is a smooth membrane and consists of flattened epithelial cells it is continuous with the endothelium lining of the blood vessels there are four chambers in the heart two upper atria and two lower ventricles ventricles have to pump blood to the whole body where as atria pump blood to the ventricles only therefore walls of the ventricles are thicker than walls of the atria wall of the left ventricle is thicker than walls of the right ventricle because the right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs which are closer to the heart whereas the left ventricle has to pump blood throughout the body therefore the blood entering the aorta from the left ventricle is at much higher blood pressure than the blood entering the pulmonary artery from the right ventricle the heart is completely divided into a right and left side by a septum the atria and ventricles on each side are divided by an atrioventricular valve av the right atrioventricular valve has three flaps hence known as tricuspid valve and the left atrioventricular valve has two flaps hence known as bicuspid valve conical shaped papillary muscles are extensions of the inner wall of the ventricles atrioventricular valves attached to the papillary muscles by fibrous cords which are called chordae tendineae atrioventricular valves are anchored by strong fibres this prevents the valves from being turned inside out semilunar valves are found at the points where the pulmonary artery and aorta leave the right and left ventricles respectively these valves prevent the backflow of blood into the ventricles two pulmonary arteries with oxygen poor blood leave the heart from the upper part of the right ventricle two pulmonary veins from each lung carry oxygen rich blood back to the left atrium the aorta with oxygen rich blood leaves from the upper part of the left ventricles the superior vena cava and inferior vena cava open into the right atrium and empty their contents into the right atrium the heart is supplied with arterial blood by the right and left coronary arteries which branch from the aorta immediately after the aortic valve,the human circulatory and lymphatic systems are essential for maintaining body function circulatory system the heart has four chambers two atria upper and two ventricles lower it operates two circuits pulmonary circuit pumps oxygenpoor blood to the lungs via pulmonary arteries for gas exchange o in co out and returns oxygenrich blood to the heart via pulmonary veins systemic circuit distributes oxygenrich blood from the left ventricle to the body through the aorta and returns oxygenpoor blood to the right atrium via the superior and inferior vena cava lymphatic system comprises lymph vessels lymph nodes and lymphoid organs returns lost fluid lymph to the bloodstream absorbs fats from the intestine and facilitates immune responses heart structure consists of three layers pericardium outer myocardium muscle layer and endocardium inner lining contains valves atrioventricular and semilunar that prevent backflow and ensure unidirectional blood flow
heart generates its own electrical impulses and beats independently of nervous or hormonal control however it is supplied with both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve fibers which increase and decrease respectively the intrinsic heart rate in addition to that heart responds to a number of circulating hormones including adrenaline and thyroxine small group of specialized neuromuscular cells in the myocardium initiate and conduct impulses the conducting system of the heart consists of following specialized system sa node sinoatrial node av node atrioventricular node atrioventricular bundle bundle of his bundle branches and purkinje fibres sa node sinoatrial node sa node is a small mass of specialized cells it lies in the myocardium of the right atrium near the opening of the superior vena cava the stimulus for contraction of the heart originates in the sa node the sa node initiates the heart beat and sets the rhythm of the heart beat so it is called the pace maker but the heart rate can be varied by the stimulation from the autonomic nervous system hormones such as adrenaline thyroxine and temperature av node av node is also a small mass of specialized cells it is situated between wall of the left and right atria the av node transmits the electrical signals from the atria into the ventricles atrioventricular bundle bundle of his bundle branches and purkinje fibres av bundle is a mass of fibers it originates from the av node the av bundle crosses the fibrous rings that separate atria and ventricle at the upper end of the ventricular septum it divides into right and left bundle branches within the ventricular myocardium the branches break up into fine fibres these fi ne fibers are purkinje fibers the av bundle branches and the purkinje fibers transmit electrical impulse from the av node to the apex of the myocardium as a result of this impulse wave of ventricular contractions begin then the contraction sweeps upwards and outwards pumping blood simultaneously into the pulmonary artery and the aorta,the heart generates its own electrical impulses allowing it to beat independently of nervous or hormonal control however it receives input from sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve fibers which can modify its intrinsic heart rate and responds to hormones like adrenaline and thyroxine the hearts conducting system consists of specialized neuromuscular cells including sa node sinoatrial node located in the right atrium it initiates the heartbeat and sets its rhythm earning it the title of pacemaker av node atrioventricular node positioned between the atria it transmits electrical signals from the atria to the ventricles atrioventricular bundle bundle of his bundle branches and purkinje fibers these structures carry impulses from the av node to the ventricular myocardium leading to coordinated ventricular contractions that pump blood into the pulmonary artery and aorta
the cardiac cycle refers to the sequences of events that take place in a complete heart beat during this process one complete cycle of pumping and filling of blood into the heart occurs complete cardiac cycle lasts for 08 second it occurs as follows 1 atrial systole contraction of the atria 2 ventricular systole contraction of the ventricles 3 complete cardiac diastole relaxation of the atria and ventricles at rest the healthy adult heart is likely to beat at a rate of 60 80 beats per minute during a single heart beat the heart contracts systole and then relaxes diastole during a single contraction the amount of blood pumped by a ventricle is called the stroke volume complete cardiac diastole this lasts for 04 second both atria and ventricles are relaxed and blood return to the heart the superior vena cava and the inferior vena cava transport oxygen poor blood into the right atrium at the same time as the four pulmonary veins bring oxygen rich blood into the left atrium the pressure of the atria is more than the pressure of the ventricles therefore atrioventricular valves are open and some blood flows passively through to the ventricles atrial systole when blood flows into the atrium sa node is stimulated then sa node triggers a wave of contractions that spreads over the myocardium of both atria hence the remaining blood in the atria flows into the ventricles thereby emptying the atria this lasts for 01 second ventricular systole through the atrial muscles the electrical impulses reaches the av node then av node triggers its own electrical impulses which quickly spread to the ventricular muscles via the av bundle the bundle branches and purkinje fibers this results in a wave of contractions which sweep upwards from the apex of the heart across the wall of the ventricles as a result both ventricles contract the pressure in the right ventricle is more than the pressure in the pulmonary artery and the pressure in the left ventricle is more than pressure in the aorta therefore pulmonary valve and aortic valves open and blood flows into pulmonary artery and aorta respectively the high pressure generated during ventricular contractions force the atrioventricular values to close preventing backflow of blood into the atria ventricular systole lasts for 03 seconds when ventricles relax the pressure within them falls the pulmonary and aortic valves close pressure within the pulmonary artery and aorta is more than pressure within the ventricles the valves of the heart and great vessels open and close according to the pressure within the chambers of the heart the sequence of opening and closing of valves ensure that blood flows only in one direction electrocardiogram ecg electrical activity in the heart can be detected on the surface of the skin by placing electrodes on the chest or limbs as the body tissues and fluids conduct electricity well such a recording is called an electrocardiogram ecg the ecg indicates the spread of the electrical signal generated by the sa node as it travels throughout the heart the normal ecg tracing of a healthy individual shows five waves which by convention have been named p q r s and t p wave it represents the impulse from the sa node as it sweeps over the atria atrial depolarization qrs wave complex represents rapid spread of impulse from the av node throughout the ventricles and electrical activity of the ventricular muscles ventricular depolarization t wave represents ventricular repolarization and relaxation of the ventricular muscles due to the larger qrs complex atrial repolarization which occurs during ventricular contraction is not seen information about the heart function of a person state of the myocardium and the cardiac conduction system can be obtained by examining the pattern of waves and the time interval between cycles and parts of cycles blood pressure the force that the blood exerts on the walls of blood vessels as it travels is referred to as blood pressure blood pressure in the arteries of systemic circulation maintains the essential flow of blood into and out of the organs of the body it is very important to keep blood pressure within normal limits high blood pressure could lead to damage blood vessels resulting in formation of clots or bleeding from damaged sites if the blood pressure falls too low there will be inadequate blood flow through tissue capillary beds this will adversely affects the normal functioning of vital organs such as the brain heart and kidneys blood pressure varies according to the time of day the posture gender age activity exercise and stress emotional states of an individual blood pressure falls at rest and during sleep blood pressure increases during excitement fear or anxiety systolic and diastolic pressure systolic pressure systolic pressure is the pressure produced within the arterial system when the left ventricle contracts and pushes blood into the aorta at rest systolic pressure in a normal healthy adult systolic pressure is about 120 mmhg diastolic pressure diastolic blood pressure is the blood pressure within the arteries following ejection of blood at complete cardiac diastolewhen the heart is at rest in a normal healthy adult diastolic pressure is about 80 mmhg arerial blood pressure is measured by a sphygmomanometer it is expressed as systolic pressure mm hg diastobic pressure mm hg,the cardiac cycle is a sequence of events in a complete heartbeat lasting approximately 08 seconds and involves the following phases atrial systole contraction of the atria triggered by the sa node which fills the ventricles with blood 01 seconds ventricular systole contraction of the ventricles initiated by impulses from the av node causing blood to flow into the pulmonary artery and aorta 03 seconds complete cardiac diastole relaxation of both atria and ventricles allowing blood to return to the heart 04 seconds blood pressure measured with a sphygmomanometer is crucial for organ function and varies based on factors like activity and stress it consists of two measurements systolic pressure pressure during ventricular contraction approximately 120 mmhg diastolic pressure pressure during cardiac diastole approximately 80 mmhg an electrocardiogram ecg records the hearts electrical activity showing p qrs and t waves which reflect atrial and ventricular depolarization and repolarization
hypertension sustained elevated blood pressure above normal limits is called hypertension consequences of hypertension are kidney damage adrenal gland disorders heart attack because of the increased heart rate and cardiac contraction strokecaused by cerebral haemorrhage damaged blood vessles which can lead to death risk factors for hypertension obesity diabetes mellitus family history smoking a sedentary life style high intake of salts high intake of alcohol stress deposition of low density lipoprotein ldl on artery walls hypotension sustained reduction of blood pressure below normal limits is called hypotension hypotension usually occurs as a complication of other condition such as shock dengue hemorrhage fever standing up suddenly from sitting or lying position over bleeding hemorrhage condition fasting low nutrition etc low blood pressure leads to inadequate blood supply to the brain depending on the cause unconsciousness may be brief fainting or prolonged possibly causing death coronary circulation the heart is supplied with arterial blood by the right and left coronary arteries which branch from the aorta immediately distal to the aortic valve the coronary arteries travel the heart wall eventually forming a vast network of capillaries most of the venous blood is collected into a number of cardiac veins that joins to form the coronary sinus which opens into the right atrium the remainder passes directly into the heart chambers through little venous channels consequences of blockage of coronary arteries the inner lining of the arteries can be thickened and harden leading to the condition called atherosclerosis which occurs as a result of fatty deposits especially cholesterol particles this can affect the normal blood supply to the organs and tissues one or more branches of coronary arteries can be blocked due to atherosclerosis which can be complicated by thrombosis blood clot depending on the place s of the block in the coronary arteries and the degree of blockage related parts of the heart muscle will be deprived of oxygen and nutrients hence narrowing of the arteries leads to chest pain angina the complete occlusion due to the blockage of one or more coronary arteries leads to heart attacks myocardial infarction which refers to the damage or death of cardiac muscle tissue due to lack of adequate oxygen and nutrients due to this heart beat rhythm may be abnormal and the heart may cease to be an effective pump the other vital organs such as brain may be deprived of inadequate supply of oxygen rich blood and heart attack may be fatal if not treated on time stroke similarly blockage due to atherosclerosis or rupture of arteries supplying blood to the brain may cause the death of nervous tissue due to lack of oxygen and nutrients this is refered to as stroke respiratory pigments respiratory pigments are organic compounds which can combine with oxygen where the partial pressure of oxygen is high and release oxygen where partial pressure of oxygen is low since oxygen is less soluble in watery medium including blood transportation of oxygen from respiratory surface to the tissues organs is a problem for complex animals to overcome this problem animals have evolved the respiratory pigments different respiratory pigments can be seen in the animal kingdom haemoglobin present in blood of human other vertebrate and annelids haemocyanin present in hemolymph of arthropods and molluscs chlorocruorin present in the blood of many annelids haemoerythrin present in the blood of marine invertebrates some annelids myoglobin present in vertebrate muscles all these respiratory pigments except myoglobin transport oxygen from respiratory surfaces to the tissues and organs and while transporting carbon dioxide from tissue organs to the respiratory surface for elimination myoglobin present in the muscle tissue has an oxygen storage function transport of respiratory gases in human blood transport of oxygen it is the hemoglobin molecule found in the erythrocytes which is responsible for the transport of oxygen around the body hemoglobin is composed of four subunits each subunit is composed of a globin protein and the haem group haem groups are responsible for the characteristic red colour of the blood a ferrous iron atom is located within each haem group and each of these can combine reversibly with one molecule of oxygen therefore each hemoglobin molecule can carry up to four oxygen molecules hb 4o 2 hbo8 hemoglobin molecules oxyhemoglobin combination of oxygen with hemoglobin to from oxyhemoglobin transport of carbon dioxide carbon dioxide is carried by the blood in different ways as hco3ions in the plasma about 70 when co2 diffuses into the red blood cells the enzyme carbonic anhydrase catalyze the combination of co2 with water to form bicarbonate hco3 and h ions the hco3moves out of the erythrocytes into the plasma as carbaminohemoglobin about 23 co2 combined with protein group of hemoglobin and form carbaminohemoglobin therefore co2 does not compete with oxygen binding sites in hemoglobin dissolved in plasma about 7 as free gas,hypertension is defined as sustained elevated blood pressure above normal limits leading to serious health consequences such as kidney damage heart attack and stroke risk factors include obesity diabetes family history smoking high salt and alcohol intake and stress conversely hypotension refers to sustained low blood pressure which can result from conditions like shock or hemorrhage leading to inadequate blood supply to the brain coronary circulation involves blood supply to the heart through the coronary arteries blockage due to atherosclerosis can cause chest pain angina or heart attacks myocardial infarction due to oxygen deprivation strokes occur when blood supply to the brain is compromised respiratory pigments such as hemoglobin and myoglobin facilitate oxygen transport in the body hemoglobin found in red blood cells binds to oxygen forming oxyhemoglobin while carbon dioxide is transported in the blood as bicarbonate ions carbaminohemoglobin or dissolved in plasma
blood which is a connective tissue is composed of cells and plasma cellular components of the blood are three types namely red blood cells white blood cells and platelets red blood cells leukocytes and platelets are developed from the bone marrow in the bones such as ribs vertebrae sternum and pelvis erythropoietin hormone from kidneys stimulates the generation of red blood cells red blood cells erythrocytes they are small biconcave disklike cells mature erythrocytes lack nuclei this character helps to carry more hemoglobin molecules within the cell they also lack mitochondria thus they produce atp via anaerobic respiration if they produce atp by aerobic respiration that will reduce the o2 transport efficiency they have about 120 days of life span generally a micro liter of blood contains 4 6 million red blood cells this figure can be varied depending on the gender and health status main function of red blood cells is the transportation of o2 molecules they also transport co2 molecules white blood cells leukocytes there are five types of leukocytes they are basophils lymphocytes eosinophils neutrophils and monocytes main functions of leukocytes are body defense phagocytic engulfing and digesting microorganisms lymphocytes develop into t cells and b cells these cells increase immune response against foreign substances platelets platelets are derived from bone marrow cells they also do not have nuclei and they play a major role in blood clotting blood plasma blood plasma consists of inorganic ions in dissolved forms plasma proteins such as albumin antibodies and fibrinogen nutrients metabolic wastes respiratory gases and hormones ph of human blood is around 74 protein concentration in plasma is higher than in interstitial fluid the dissolved ions in the plasma buffer and maintain the osmotic balance in the blood albumin in the plasma also buffers the blood and antibodies are involved in defense fibrinogen in the plasma aids in blood clotting when the clotting factors are removed from the plasma it is called as serum major functions of blood transport of oxygen to organs and removal of carbon dioxide from the organs and tissues transport of soluble excretory materials to organs of excretion transport of nutrients transport of hormones from the glands where they are produced to target organs defence against foreign invasions aids in osmoregulation blood clotting when a tissue is damaged blood flows from it and coagulates to form a blood clot this prevents further blood loss and entry of pathogenic micro organisms which is of clear survival value in general the blood in undamaged vessels does not clot a highly complex series of reactions takes place in order for coagulation to occur as well as prevent unwanted clotting when the blood vessel is damaged the connective tissues of the vessel wall is exposed therefore platelets in the blood adhere to the collagen fibers in the connective tissue and release substance that makes close by platelets sticky this platelet plug provides instant protection against blood loss then platelets release clotting factors they trigger the formation of thrombin then thrombin converts fibrinogen into fi brin next this fibrin aggregates into threads that form a network of the clot the activated thrombin is also involved in formation of more thrombin which completes the formation of blood clot clotting does not occur in undamaged blood vessels because the lining of the vessels is very smooth and does not promote platelet aggregation or cell rupture also some substances such as heparin prevent clotting heparin prevent the conversion of prothrombin into thrombin and fibrinogen to fi brin and is widely used clinically as an anticoagulant grouping of blood the surface of the red blood cells carries antigens called aggulitinogen antigen a and antigen b in addition individuals have antibodies in plasma antia and antib according to abo blood grouping system there are four blood groups namely a b ab and o a person with a specific antigen in red cells does not possess the corresponding antibody in the plasma eg anyone with antigen a on the red blood cell membrane has no antia antibody in the plasma if red blood cells have antigen a and plasma has antibodies b antib that persons blood group is a if red blood cells have antigen b and plasma with antibodies a antia that persons blood group is b if red blood cells have both antigen a and b and plasma has no antia or anti b antibodies that persons blood group is ab if red blood cells have no antigen a or b but plasma has both antibodies antia and antib that persons blood group is o when a patient receives a blood transfusion it is vital that they receive blood that is compatible with their own if it is incompatible a type of immune response occurs this is because the donors red cell membranes possess glycoprotein which act as antigens and react with antibodies agglutinin in the recipients plasma the result is that the donors cells are agglutinated therefore when transfusion occurs it is important to know blood group of donor and recipient people with blood group ab make neither antia nor antib antibodies transfusion of type a b or ab blood into these individuals is likely to be safe since there are no antibodies to react with them person with ab blood group is known as a universal recipient individual with blood group o has neither antigen a nor antigen b on their plasma membrane of red blood cells but they do have antibodies antia and antib in their plasma so these individuals having blood group o can donate blood to the persons with any blood group a person with the blood group o is known as a universal donor therefore prior to transfusion crossmatching is still required to ensure that there is no reaction between donor and recipient blood the rhesus system some individuals have antigen called rhesus factor on the plasma membrane of red blood cells individuals having this factor on the red blood cells are called rh and those who do not have this factor are called rh rh individuals do not have anti rhesus antibodies in the plasma while individuals who are rh have antirhesus antibodies in their plasma however if rh blood enters a rh negative individual the recipient responds by manufacturing rh antibodies in the blood plasma when a rh mother bears a rhesus positive rh child during delivery few rh red blood cells of the fetus may enter the mothers circulation and cause the mother to produce rh antibodies in her plasma if the mother is pregnant for the second time with a rhesus positive fetus the rh antibodies developed in her plasma in response to the first childs red blood sells can pass across the placenta to the fetus and destroy fetal red cells normally rh antibodies are not formed in large enough quantities in the mothers plasma to affect the first born child however subsequent rh children can suffer destruction of their red blood cells,blood is a connective tissue composed of cellular componentsred blood cells erythrocytes white blood cells leukocytes and plateletssuspended in plasma red blood cells transport oxygen o2 and carbon dioxide co2 and have a lifespan of about 120 days white blood cells including basophils lymphocytes eosinophils neutrophils and monocytes defend the body against infections platelets are crucial for blood clotting forming a plug at injury sites blood plasma contains proteins ions nutrients and hormones maintaining osmotic balance and ph around 74 blood types a b ab o depend on specific antigens and antibodies affecting transfusion compatibility the rhesus rh system classifies blood based on the presence of the rh factor which can lead to complications in pregnancies if rh mothers carry rh babies
gross structure and function of the human respiratory system human respiratory system consists of the following major parts nostrils nasal cavity pharynx larynx a series of branching ducts starting from the trachea two bronchi one leading to each lung and smaller bronchioles which finally end in air sacs called alveoli the bronchioles and the alveoli are contained within the paired coneshaped lungs located in the thoracic cavity the two lungs differ slightly in shape and size the left lung is slightly smaller than the right because the apex of the heart is slightly to the left of the median plane and it has 2 lobes while the right lung has 3 lobes each lung is surrounded by two membranes the inner membrane called the visceral pleura adheres to the outer surface of the lungs while the outer membrane called the parietal pleura adheres to the wall of the thoracic cavity between these two membranes there is a thin fluid filled space during respiration air enters the respiratory system through the nostrils in the nasal cavity air is filtered by hairs and is warmed and humidified as it travels through spaces in the nasal cavity the nasal cavity leads to the pharynx which is a common passage for both air and food that means air passage and food passage cross each other during swallowing of food the larynx moves upwards which allows the epiglottis to close the opening of the larynx called the glottis this allows food to go down the esophagus to the stomach the rest of the time the glottis is open so that air can move from the pharynx through the larynx to the trachea in the larynx are vocal cords which are made up of largely elastic fibers these vocal cords help produce sound when expired air rushes across the stretched or tensed vocal cords causing them to vibrate both the walls of the larynx and trachea are strengthened by cartilage that help these airways to keep open the air passes from the trachea into the two bronchi that lead into each lung within the lungs the air passes through smaller and smaller branches of the bronchi called bronchioles the epithelium found in the major branches of this respiratory tract has cilia and a thin film of mucus the mucus helps trap the dust and other particulate contaminants in the inhaled air then the beating of cilia moves this mucus upwards towards the pharynx where it is swallowed into the esophagus this process is referred to as the mucus escalator it helps clean the respiratory system at the tips of tiniest bronchioles are large number of small air sacs clustered together the air passes into these air sacs called alveoli where gas exchange occurs the walls of the alveoli are made up of a single layer of flattened epithelial cells that lack cilia this inner lining of the alveoli is coated by a thin film of fluid the lungs contain millions of alveoli this allows a large surface area for gas exchange each alveolus is also surrounded by a network of capillaries oxygen in the air that enters the alveoli dissolves in the moist film and rapidly diffuse across the thin epithelium into the capillaries meanwhile a net diffusion of carbon dioxide occurs from the capillaries into the alveoli since there are no cilia in the alveoli there are white blood cells in the alveoli to engulf foreign particles alveoli are also coated with a surfactant that reduces the surface tension thereby preventing the collapse of alveoli due to high surface tension mechanism of ventilation of the lungs ventilation of the lungs is necessary to maintain high oxygen and low carbon dioxide concentrations in the alveoli or the gas exchange surface ventilation is accomplished by breathing which is the alternating movement of air into inhalation and out of exhalation the lungs humans employ what is referred to as negative pressure breathing where air is pulled rather than pushed into lungs inhalation is an active process contraction of rib muscles or intercoastal muscles and the diaphragm which is a sheet of skeletal muscle that forms the bottom of the thoracic cavity leads to the expansion of the thoracic cavity the visceral and parietal pleurae surrounding the lung stick together due to the surface tension of the fluid between these two membranes this allows the two membranes to slide smoothly past each other hence as the volume of the thoracic cavity increases the lung volume increases as well as a result the pressure within the lungs decrease relative to the outside air this creates a pressure gradient between the atmosphere and the lungs thus air flows from a high pressure gradient in the atmosphere to a lower pressure gradient in the lungs during exhalations which is usually a passive process the rib muscles and the diaphragm relax this cause the volume of the thoracic cavity to reduce as a result the pressure inside the lungs increase in relation to the air outside this pressure forces air to move out of the lungs through the respiratory tubes into the atmosphere when a man is at rest contraction of rib muscles and contraction of diaphragm are enough for breathing however depending on the activity level additional muscles may be used to aid breathing such as muscles of the neck back and chest these muscles further help to increase the volume of the thoracic cavity by raising the rib cage eg during exercise the lungs serve as an efficient respiratory surface because alveoli create a large surface area for gas exchange alveoli and capillary walls are both lined by simple squamous epithelia which reduce the distance the gasses need to travel by diffusion the alveoli surface is moist to dissolve respiratory gasses for diffusion alveoli are highly vascularized which enables the maintenance of a steep diffusion gradient of respiratory gasses gas exchange at the alveoli and in the tissues is a continuous process it requires transport of o2 from the lungs to the blood and movement of co2 from the blood referred to as external respiration and movement of o2 from blood to the tissues and co 2 from tissues to the blood referred to as internal respiration diffusion of o 2 and co2 requires partial pressure gradients between the alveolar air in the lungs and blood during external respiration and blood and tissues during internal respiration during inhalation fresh air mixes with the stale air in the lungs this mixture in the lungs has a higher partial pressure of oxygen po2 and a lower partial pressure of carbon dioxide pco2 than the blood in the alveolar capillaries there is thus a concentration gradient favoring the diffusion of these two gases in opposite directions net diffusion of o 2 takes place from the air in the alveoli to the blood and net diffusion of co 2 takes place from the blood into the alveoli when o 2 molecules diffuses into blood capillaries they bind to heamoglobin in the red blood cells four molecules of o 2 bind reversibly with one molecule of haemoglobin and form oxyhaemoglobin hb 4 o2 hbo8 when blood leaves the alveolar capillaries the oxygen and carbon dioxide partial pressures are in equilibrium with those of alveoli air once this blood returns to the heart it is pumped through the systemic circuit blood reaching the tissues in the systemic capillaries have a higher po2 and a lower pco 2 than in the tissues these partial pressure gradients result in the net diffusion of o 2 from the blood stream into the tissue and co2 diffusion from the cells into the blood stream across the extracellular fluidinterstitial fluid this is called unloading of o 2 and loading of co2 then the blood returns to heart and pumped to lungs again,the human respiratory system consists of structures including the nostrils nasal cavity pharynx larynx trachea bronchi bronchioles and alveoli the lungs which contain alveoli are essential for gas exchange with the left lung having two lobes and the right lung three air enters through the nostrils is filtered and warmed in the nasal cavity and passes through the pharynx to the larynx where sound is produced by vibrating vocal cords ventilation occurs through negative pressure breathing inhalation is active expanding the thoracic cavity while exhalation is passive decreasing thoracic volume gas exchange involves the diffusion of oxygen o from alveoli into the blood and carbon dioxide co from the blood into the alveoli aided by the steep concentration gradients and moist surfaces of alveoli hemoglobin in red blood cells binds o facilitating its transport to tissues while co is released into the bloodstream for removal
typically breathing is regulated by involuntary mechanisms these involuntary mechanisms help coordinate gas exchange with blood circulation and metabolic demands medulla oblongata is the main breathing regulating center found at the base brain there are a pair of breathing control centers found in medulla and they are responsible for regulating the breathing rhythm a negativefeedback mechanism is involved in regulating this process sensors which detect stretching of the lung tissues are found in the lungs during inhalation these sensors send nerve impulses to the neurons that act as control circuits in the medulla and further inhalation is inhibited and this prevents the lungs from over expanding to regulate breathing the medulla depends on ph changes in tissue fluids the ph of tissue fluid is an indicator of blood carbon dioxide concentration for example when metabolic activities increase the concentration of co2 in the blood increases because co 2 diffuse into the cerebrospinal fluid this results in an increase of co 2 concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid as well there co2 reacts with water and form carbonic acid h2co3 h2co3 dissociate into hco3 and h co 2 h2o h2co3 hco3 h hence a high co2 concentration results in an increase in h concentration thereby a lower ph this ph change is detected by the sensors in the medulla and in major blood vessels called arteries and aorta sensors in the medulla and major blood vessels detect this decrease in ph in response the control circuits in medulla increase the depth and rate of breathing until the excess co 2 is removed in exhaled air and the ph of blood comes to its normal value which is 74 the o 2 level has little influences on the breathing control centers but when o2 concentration becomes very low o2 sensors found in the aorta and the carotid arteries send impulses to the medulla to increase the breathing rate the regulation of breathing is also modulated by additional neural circuits in the pons a part of the brain stem found above the medulla,breathing is primarily regulated by involuntary mechanisms particularly by the medulla oblongata which controls the breathing rhythm through a pair of centers a negativefeedback mechanism is involved stretch sensors in the lungs send signals to inhibit further inhalation preventing overexpansion the medulla also responds to changes in blood ph which indicates carbon dioxide co concentration increased co from metabolic activities lowers ph due to the formation of carbonic acid hco which dissociates into bicarbonate hco and hydrogen ions h this decrease in ph stimulates the medulla to increase the rate and depth of breathing to expel excess co and restore ph to its normal level 74 while oxygen o levels minimally affect breathing very low o concentrations trigger sensors in the aorta and carotid arteries to signal the medulla to increase breathing rates additionally the pons located above the medulla modulates breathing regulation
the effect of smoking on the smooth functioning of the respiratory system cigarette smoke harms nearly every organ in the body including the organs of the respiratory system and increase the risk of illness disability and death smokers inhale large number of chemicals which mainly come from burning tobacco some of these inhaled compounds are chemically active and can trigger damaging changes in the body nicotine is among the compounds inhaled in tobacco smoke which is the addictive drug in the smoke it temporarily increases the rate of heart beat and constriction of peripheral blood vessels causing a temporary increase in blood pressure cigarette smoke stimulates the secretion of mucus by the goblet cells and inhibits the action of cilia in the respiratory tract causing accumulation of mucus in bronchioles and blocking them leading to bronchial inflammation or bronchitis as a result breathing may become difficult some chemicals such as hydrogen cyanide in cigarette smoke stops the cilia from working properly due to loss of action of cilia dust and other particulate matter get collected in the lung resulting in an increase in phagocytic cells in the lung tissue due to release of large amounts of lytic enzymes by these cells the alveolar tissue is destroyed thus reducing the effective area available for gas exchange carbon monoxide co present in tobacco smoke is absorbed into the blood and is able to bind to hemoglobin better than oxygen and combines irreversibly with hemoglobin thus it decreases the amount of oxyhaemoglobin produced therefore oxygen transport through blood is decreased tobacco smoke also contains a large number of cancercausing substances carcinogens nearly 90 of lung cancers are due to smoking long term exposure to such chemicals in cigarette smoke results in the proliferation of cells in the bronchial epithelium forming a mass of abnormal cells a cancer may develop among these cells if these cells break free the cancer may spread to other parts of the lungs and or to other organs passive or second hand smoking will also result in the above mentioned ill effects silicosis this may be caused by longterm exposure to dust containing silica compounds high risk industries are quarrying granite slate sandstone mining hard coal gold tin copper stone masonry and sand blasting glass and pottery work when silica particles are inhaled they accumulate in the alveoli these particles are ingested by macrophages some of which remain in the alveoli and come out in to the connective tissue around bronchioles and blood vessels close to the pleura progressive fibrosis is stimulated which eventually obliterates the blood vessels and respiratory bronchioles gradual destruction of lung tissue eventually leads to pulmonary hypertension and heart failure asbestos related diseases asbestosis those who are involved in making or using products containing asbestos are at risk this occurs when asbestos fibers are inhaled with dust in spite of their large size the particles penetrate the level of respiratory bronchioles and alveoli macrophages accumulate in the alveoli and the shorter asbestos fibers are ingested the larger fibers are surrounded by macrophages protein materials and iron deposits the macrophages that have engulfed fibers move out of the alveoli and accumulate around respiratory bronchioles and blood vessels stimulating the formation of fibrous tissue these cause progressive destruction of lung tissue and pulmonary hypertension lung cancer nearly 90 of lung cancer is due to smoking when one smokes the nasal hairs mucus and cilia in the respiratory tract that otherwise is sufficient to protect the lung from chemical and biological irritants are overwhelmed and eventually stop functioning as a result irritants free radicals carcinogens and pathogens accumulate in the lungs eventually these cause lung cancer tuberculosis tb tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium mycobacterium tuberculosis the bacterium spreads when an infected person coughs and the bacterium enters the body of an uninfected person through inhaled air the most common form is pulmonary tb which affects the lungs other organs may also be affected transmission of pulmonary tb is by inhaling the bacterium into the lungs this bacterium can survive in the air and in the house dust for long periods malnutrition and other infectious can reduce resistance to the disease symptoms loss of appetite loss of weight excessive sweating fever a racking cough and spitting up blood asthma asthma is characterized by wheezing and chest tightness causing breathing difficulty this is caused by the sudden contractions of smooth muscles in the walls of the bronchioles which causes the bronchioles to narrow or even close during this time breathing causes whistling or wheezing sound the cause of asthma is an over reaction of an immune response to stimuli like pollen dust mites spores particular food cold air exercise smoking gases antiinflammatory drugs help control respiratory cycle and lung volumes and capacities inhalation and exhalation during a single breath is referred to as a respiratory cycle the amount of air that flows in and out of the lungs depends on the conditions of inspiration and expiration thus four respiratory volumes are described tidal volume tv this is the volume of air inhaled and exhaled with each breath during normal breathing on average it is about 500 ml in a resting adult human inspiratory reserve volume irv this is the extra volume of air that can be forcibly inhaled beyond the tidal volume expiratory reserve volume erv the extra volume of air which can be expelled from the lungs after a tidal expiration residual volume rv the volume of air that remains in the lungs even after forceful expiration this is on average is about 1200 ml specific combinations of respiratory volumes are called respiratory capacities thus respiratory capacities always consist of two or more lung volumes the respiratory capacities are important to determine the respiratory status of a person inspiratory capacity ic the total volume of air that can be inspired after a tidal expiration thus ic tv irv functional residual capacity frc the volume of air remaining in the lungs at the end of a tidal expiration thus frc rv erv the functional residual capacity is important for continuous exchange of gas in the alveoli and to prevent the collapse of the alveoli during expiration vital capacity vc the maximum volume of air which can be inhaled and exhaled it is normally around 3100 ml in women and 4800 ml in men vc tv irv erv total lung capacity tlc the maximum volume of air the lungs can hold or the sum of all lung volumes this is normally around 6000 ml in addition some of the inspired air fills the system of branching conducting tubes trachea bronchi and bronchioles and never contributes to the gas exchange in the alveoli this volume is referred to as the anatomical dead space and it is typically about 150 ml,smoking significantly harms the respiratory system by introducing harmful chemicals and carcinogens key effects include nicotine an addictive substance that increases heart rate and blood pressure mucus production cigarette smoke stimulates mucus secretion while inhibiting cilia action leading to bronchial inflammation and difficulty breathing lung tissue damage chemicals like hydrogen cyanide and carbon monoxide impair ciliary function and reduce oxygen transport by binding to hemoglobin leading to lower oxyhemoglobin levels lung cancer nearly 90 of lung cancers are linked to smoking as irritants and carcinogens accumulate in the lungs tuberculosis tb a contagious disease caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis primarily

the state of being resistance to injury invading pathogens and foreign substances through defensive mechanisms in the body is known as immunity pathogens which are the agents that can cause infectious diseases include some bacteria virus and fungi the substances that can be recognized as foreign to the body include chemical components of pollen grains incompatible blood cells and transplanted tissues defenses in the animal body against these foreign invasions make up the immune system immune system of animals should be able to distinguish own body cells self from foreign cellsparticles within the body nonself for initiating defensive immune responses for destruction of the foreign agents such as pathogens special cell types in the body fluid and tissues of most animals can interact with these foreign invasions and destroy them immune cells produce receptor molecules that bind specifically to molecules from foreign cells and agents and activate defense responses immune responses in animals can be divided into two types innate immunity acquired immunity adaptive immunity innate immunity innate immunity is the ability to resist damage or diseases in the body through inherent body defenses which offer rapid responses against a broad range of pathogens and foreign substances in innate immunity recognition and defense responses will depend on characters common to groups of pathogens innate immunity lacks specific responses to specific invaders and its protective mechanisms functions the same way regardless of the type of the invader hence innate immunity is also known as nonspecific defense innate immune responses include defense mechanisms that provide immediate but general protection against foreign invasion innate immunity is found in both invertebrates and vertebrates innate defense mechanisms can be broadly divided into two types external barriers external defenses barrier defense and internal nonspecific defenses internal defenses external defenses barrier defense in innate immunity external barriers discourage pathogens and foreign substances from penetrating the body so they are considered as the first line of defense for innate immunity in the human body external defensesbarriers are found in the skin mucus membranes and secretions of various organs they act as physical and chemical barriers human skin with its many layers of closely packed keratinized cell layers in the epidermis provides a significant physical barrier to entrance of microbes in addition periodic shedding of epidermal cells helps remove microbes from the skin surface the mucous membranes which line the body cavities provide a physical barrier to entrance of many microbes eg the linings of the respiratory tract digestive tract urinary tract and reproductive tract the mucous membranes produce mucus which traps microbes and other particles in the respiratory tract ciliated epithelial cells sweep mucus and any entrapped material upward coughing and sneezing speed up the mucus movement and its entrapped pathogens out of the body preventing their entry to the lungs secretions by various organs eg tears saliva mucus help as physical and chemical barriers to protect epithelial surface of the skin and mucous membranes tears in the eyes provide protection against irritants and microbes tears in the eyes provide continuous washing action that helps to dilute microbes and prevent settling on the surface of eyes saliva washes microbes from the mouth surface and the flow of saliva reduces the colonization of microbes in the mouth mucus secretions which bathe various exposed epithelia provide a continual washing action to dilute and inhibit colonization microbes such as bacteria and fungi lysozyme an enzyme present in tears saliva perspiration and mucous secretions can destroy cell walls of some bacteria gastric juice which provides an acidic environment in the stomach can destroy many bacteria and bacterial toxins ingested with food secretions of the sweat and sebaceous glands of the skin give acidity of the skin which helps to prevent growth of bacteria internal defenses in innate immunity when the pathogens penetrate the external defensive barriers in the skin and mucus membranes in the human body they encounter a second line of innate immunity responses called internal defenses within the body detection of nonself is accomplished by molecular recognition in which receptor molecules on specific cells in the immune system will bind specifically to molecules of foreign agents such as pathogens in innate immunity internal defenses consist of phagocytic cells natural killer cells antimicrobial proteins and inflammatory responses phagocytic cells these are specialized cells that can ingest microbes foreign particles and cell debris for intra cellular digestion and destruction phagocytes use the receptor molecules to detect components of foreign agents and particles neutrophils and macrophages are the two main types of phagocytic cells in man while circulating in the blood neutrophils are attracted first to the infected site by signals from affected tissues then neutrophils can ingest and destroy infected pathogens macrophages are larger and more potent phagocytic cells natural killer cells these are a type of lymphocytes present in the blood and some tissueorgans such as spleen and lymph nodes which function in nonspecific defense they can detect the cells with abnormal surface molecules eg virusinfected body cells and some cancerous cells and kill them natural killer cells do not engulf these abnormal cells but upon binding they can release chemicals to kill the virusinfected cells and cancerous cells which could inhibit further spread of the virus or cancer antimicrobial proteins they are proteins present in the blood and interstitial fluids which function in innate defense by attacking microbes directly or impeding their reproduction interferons and complement proteins are two such antimicrobial proteins that discourage microbial growth interferons are proteins secreted by virusinfected body cells that protect uninfected host cells from viral infections by interfering with the viral replication once released by virusinfected cells interferons diffuse to uninfected neighboring cells where they are stimulated to produce antiviral proteins which inhibit viral replication some interferons activate macrophages which enhance the phagocytic activity complement proteins are a group of normally inactive proteins in the blood plasma and plasma membranes when they are activated by different substances present on the surfaces of microbes a cascade of biochemical reaction occurs which lead to lysis of invaded cells they also promote phagocytosis and inflammatory response inflammatory response this is an innate immune defense response in the body to tissue damage triggered by microbial infections or injury of the tissues this involves the release of substances that promote increased permeability and dilation of blood vessels enhance migration of phagocytes destruction of invading pathogens and aid in tissue repair figure 531 inflammation attempts to destroy the microbes at the site of the injury preventing the spread to other tissues and promote tissue repair inflammatory response is brought about by various signaling molecules upon infection or injury histamine is one of the important inflammatory signaling molecules released mainly by mast cells in the connective tissues at the site of damage histamine causes increased permeability and dilation of nearby blood vessels blood capillaries increased permeability of the blood vessels enhance the infiltration of white blood cells antimicrobial proteins and clotting elements to enter the injured area from the blood that aid in destruction of invading pathogens and tissue repair dilation of blood vessels allows more blood to flow through the damage area which helps to remove dead cells activated phagocytes macrophages and neutrophils moved from the blood to the damaged tissue area can also discharge signaling molecules cytokines which also promote blood flow to the injured or infected site during inflammation activated complement proteins can cause further histamine release which attracts more phagocyte cells to enter injured tissue and carry out additional phagocytosis this process can digest the microbes and cell debris at the site of injury signs and symptoms of inflammation are redness heat swelling and pain dilation of blood vessels causes redness and heat production due to high metabolism in the area increased permeability of blood vessels triggers localized swelling due to leaking of tissue fluid into neighboring tissues pain results from injury to neurons and microbial toxins as a result of most inflammatory responses pus may be accumulated it is a fluid rich in dead phagocytes dead pathogens and cell debris from the damaged tissue minor injury or infection causes a localized inflammatory response if the injury or infection is severe it may lead to a systemic response throughout the body leading to fever elevated body temperature within limits may enhance the phagocytosis and accelerate tissue repair by speeding up the chemical reactions,immunity is the bodys ability to resist injury and invasion by pathogens which include bacteria viruses and fungi the immune system distinguishes self body cells from nonself foreign substances to initiate defensive responses immune responses are classified into two types innate immunity this is the first line of defense offering rapid nonspecific responses to pathogens it includes external defenses skin mucous membranes and secretions eg tears saliva act as physical and chemical barriers against pathogens internal defenses phagocytic cells eg neutrophils macrophages ingest and destroy pathogens natural killer cells eliminate abnormal cells antimicrobial proteins eg interferons complement proteins hinder pathogen reproduction and the inflammatory response increases blood flow and attracts immune cells to sites of infection or injury signs of inflammation include redness heat swelling and pain
acquired immunity is the ability of the body to defend itself against invading foreign agents eg pathogens through specific defense responses mediated by diverse t lymphocytes and b lymphocytes acquired immunity shows i specificity for particular foreign molecules ii recognition of animals own molecules selfmolecules from nonselfmolecules and iii memory for most previously encountered pathogens such that the subsequent encounter causes a stronger and more rapid response immunological memory in the animal kingdom acquired immunity is found only in the vertebrates in acquired immunity two types of immune responses are mediated by t lymphocytes and b lymphocytes they are cell mediated immune responses and humoral immune responses humoral immune response is also called as antibody mediated immune response both immune responses are triggered by antigens a given pathogen may provoke both types of immune responses cell mediated immune response cell mediated immune response is a type of acquired immunity in which specifically sensitized t lymphocytes attach to the antigen undergo proliferation and eventually differentiate into cytotoxic t cells that can directly kill the cells with the invading antigen in addition memory t cells are formed that can cause stronger and more rapid response at the subsequent encounter of the same antigen to the body this is particularly effective against infected cells fungi parasites and virus that are present within host cells some cancer cells and foreign transplanted cells cell mediated immunity always involves cells attacking cells humoral immune response humoral immune response is a type of acquired immunity in which specifically sensitized b lymphocytes attach to a particular antigen undergo proliferation and eventually differentiate into plasma cells that secrete circulating antibodies that can neutralize and inactivate the specific toxins and pathogens in the blood and lymph in addition memory b cells are formed that can cause stronger and more rapid response at subsequent encounter of the same antigen humoral immune response works mainly against antigens present in body fluids and extracellular pathogens mainly bacteria that multiply in the body fluids antibodies antibodies are proteins secreted by plasma cells differentiated b lymphocytes in response to specific antigens the antibody binds with that antigen to neutralize inhibit or destroy it antibodies can neutralize and inactivate the specific toxins and pathogens in the body fluids the antibodies do not directly kill the pathogens but can interfere with activity of the pathogen or mark the pathogen for inactivation and destruction antibodyantigen complexes can activate complement system and phagocytosis to destroy the pathogen antibodies are also called as immunoglobulins immunoglobulin has the same y shaped structure as b lymphocyte antigen receptors but are secreted than membrane bound,acquired immunity is the bodys specific defense against foreign agents mediated by t lymphocytes and b lymphocytes it features specificity targets particular foreign molecules selfrecognition distinguishes selfmolecules from nonselfmolecules immunological memory remembers previous encounters for stronger and quicker responses two main types of immune responses occur cellmediated immune response activated t lymphocytes especially cytotoxic t cells kill infected or abnormal cells memory t cells are also formed for faster responses in future encounters humoral immune response activated b lymphocytes differentiate into plasma cells which produce antibodies to neutralize toxins and pathogens in body fluids memory b cells enhance responses during subsequent exposures antibodies are proteins secreted by plasma cells that bind to specific antigens marking them for destruction and activating the complement system antibodies are also known as immunoglobulins
recognition of the antigen binding to the antigen and sensitization for an acquired immune response to occur some t lymphocytes or b lymphocytes must first recognize that a foreign antigen is present in the body even though there are vast variety of antigen receptors present on different b lymphocytes and t lymphocytes only a very small fraction are specific for a particular epitope hence antigen should be presented to the b lymphocytes and t lymphocytes until a match is made recognition of the antigen occurs through successful match between an epitope of the antigen and an antigen receptor on small number of b lymphocytes or t lymphocytes as specific antigen receptors produced by a single t cell or b cell can be identical they can bind to the same epitope hence both t and b cells can respond to any pathogen that produces molecules containing that same epitope but b cells and t cells encounter antigens in different ways t lymphocytes only recognize the fragments of antigenic proteins that are presented to the cells by a special cells called antigen presenting cells macrophages dendritic cells and b cells however b lymphocytes can recognize and bind to the antigens present in blood plasma lymph and interstitial fluid the binding of an antigen to the specific antigen receptor results in sensitization activation of a specific t lymphocyte or b lymphocyte which initiates cell mediated and antibody mediated immune response as described below proliferation and differentiation into effector cells once activated the t lymphocyte or b lymphocyte undergoes multiple cell divisions proliferations resulting a clone a population of cells that are identical to the original lymphocyte some cells of clones become effectors cells which are short lived cells that take effect immediately against antigen to provide primary immune responses elimination of invaders the effector forms of t lymphocyte are cytotoxic t cells and helper t cells cytotoxic t cells use toxic proteins to kill the cells infected with the pathogen signals from helper t cells activate cytotoxic t cells to kill the infected cells signals from helper t cells can also activate b lymphocytes to initiate antibody production effector forms of b lymphocytes are plasma cells a single activated b lymphocyte can form thousands of identical plasma cells the plasma cells begin producing and secreting a soluble form of the b lymphocyte antigen receptor antibodies in large quantities which are released to the blood and lymph hence circulating antibodies can neutralize and inactivate the specific toxins and pathogens in the body fluids provide immunological memory following differentiation into effector t cells cytotoxic t cells and helper t cells other t lymphocytes in the clones remain as memory t cells which are long lived that can give rise to effector t cells if the same antigen is encountered later in the life similarly the remaining b lymphocytes in the clones are memory b cells which are long lived that can give rise to plasma cells if the same antigen is encountered later in the life these memory t cells and memory b cells can cause stronger and more rapid response at subsequent encounter of the same antigen to the body this immunological memory is called secondary immune responses active immunity active immunity is a long lasting immunity mediated by the action of b lymphocytes and t lymphocytes in the body and the resulting b and t memory cells specific for a pathogen active immunity can be developed as a result of natural infection of a pathogen or artificial immunization naturally acquired active immunity long lasting immunity developed in the body against various infectious diseases in response to natural infections of pathogens is called naturally acquired active immunity in response to a disease causing agent entering the body naturally for the first time eg virus of chickenpox some t lymphocytes and b lymphocytes in the body become activated and eventually produce specific cytotoxic t cells and antibodies to destroy the pathogen memory b cells and t cells produced in this process are long lived that will provide a stronger and rapid immune responses to destroy the particular antigen if the same antigen eg virus of chickenpox is encountered later in the life in this way the body can resist to subsequent infections of the same antigen artificially acquired active immunity long lasting immunity induced artificially in the body against various infectious diseases through vaccination immunization of attenuated virulencereduced pathogens is called artificially acquired active immunity immunization can be carried out with preparations of antigens vaccines from many sources such as killed or weakened pathogens inactivated bacterial cells or genes encoding microbial proteins these vaccines act as the antigens and stimulate cell mediated and antibody mediated immune responses leading to production of long lived memory b and t cells to destroy the antigen if the pathogen from which the antigen was derived is encountered naturally later in the life long lived memory cells can provide a stronger and rapid immune responses to destroy the particular pathogen in general the antigens used in the vaccines are pretreated to be immunogenic but not pathogenic for example bcg vaccine which is used against tuberculosis disease in man has been prepared from a strain of the attenuated live tuberculosis bacteria polio vaccine consists of live attenuated poliovirus strains polio vaccine produces antibodies in the blood against polio virus and in the event of infection this protects the individual by preventing the spread of poliovirus to the nervous system eg penicillin venom from honey bees and wasps whenever an allergic reaction takes place the tissue injury occurs the most allergens stimulate production of plasma cells which secrete antibodies specific for the antigen when the same allergen enter the body later it become attach to the antibodies specific to the allergen which induce the mast cells to release histamine and other inflammatory chemicals acting on a variety of cell types these signals bring about typical allergy symptoms such as sneezing runny nose teary eyes and smooth muscle contractions in the airways of the lungs that can result in breathing difficulties an acute allergic conditions sometimes lead to death of the person due to breathing difficulties and low blood pressure with a few seconds of exposure to an allergen autoimmune diseases in some persons the immune system becomes active against particular selfmolecules of the body and begins to attack the persons own tissues leading to an autoimmune disease possible causes for autoimmune diseases may be genetic factors gender and unknown environmental triggers many autoimmune diseases affect females than males a variety of mechanisms produce different autoimmune diseases some involve the production of autoantibodies that can affect normal functioning of certain body molecules some involve activation of cytotoxic t cells that destroy certain body cells examples for autoimmune diseases include type 1 diabetes mellitus multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis in type 1 diabetes mellitus t cells attack the insulin producing pancreatic beta cells in multiple sclerosis t cells attack myelin sheaths around neurons in rheumatoid arthritis painful inflammations of the cartilage and bones occur as the immune system mistakenly sends antibodies to the lining of the joints where they attack the tissue surrounding the joints immunodeficiency diseases immunodeficiency disease is a disorder in which responses of the immune system to antigens are defective or absent an immunodeficiency can lead to frequent and recurrent infections and increased susceptibility to certain cancers an inborn immunodeficiency results from a genetic or developmental defects in the production of immune system cells or specific proteins such as antibodies or proteins of the complement system acquired immunodeficiency can be developed later in life due to the exposure to chemicals or biological agents drugs used to fight autoimmune diseases or prevent transplant rejections suppress the immune system leading to an immunodeficiency state the human immunodeficiency virus hiv the pathogen that cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids escapes and attacks the immune system of man the hiv causes progressive destruction of immune responses in the person leading to frequent infections and increased susceptibility to certain cancers which can cause death,the acquired immune response involves the recognition of foreign antigens by t lymphocytes and b lymphocytes key processes include recognition and binding t and b lymphocytes recognize specific epitopes on antigens leading to sensitization t lymphocytes require antigen presentation by antigenpresenting cells while b lymphocytes can bind directly to antigens in body fluids proliferation and differentiation activated lymphocytes undergo proliferation forming clones some differentiate into effector cells cytotoxic t cells kill infected cells helper t cells activate b lymphocytes and cytotoxic t cells plasma cells produce antibodies that neutralize pathogens immunological memory memory t and b cells provide stronger and quicker responses upon reexposure to the same antigen active immunity can be naturally acquired through infection or artificially acquired through vaccination in contrast autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system attacks selfmolecules while immunodeficiency diseases involve a defective immune response
osmoregulation is processes by which organisms control solute concentrations and water balance within the body simple unicellular organisms such as amoeba paramecium etc use contractile vacuoles for osmoregulation but animals have developed different structures for osmoregulation the chemical reactions that occur in organisms result in the formation of waste products often toxic which must be disposed in some way the removal of the nitrogenous metabolite and other metabolic waste products from the body is called excretion defecation is not considered under excretion as it involves the removal of undigested food from the gut in many animals excretory and osomoregulatory systems are linked structurally and functionally importance and need of osmoregulation and excretion for effective body functioning and survival animals have to maintain a constant internal environment specially the relative concentrations of water and solutes within favorable limits therefore animals need to regulate the chemical composition of body fluids by balancing uptake and loss of water and solutes animal cells will swell and burst if water uptake is excessive on the other hand animal cells will shrink and die if water loss is high the driving force of loss of water in animals as in plants is the concentration gradient of solutes across the cell membrane animals have evolved different osmoregulatory strategies depending on the environment in which they live for their survival animals have to get rid of toxic products produced during metabolism in order to safeguard the composition of their internal environment otherwise these excretory end products become toxic to the body cells for example protein and nucleic acids are broken down within the body cell during metabolism and the amine group is converted to ammonia which is highly toxic ammonia also acts as a weak base oxidation of glucose during metabolism will release co2 which is a weak acid accumulation of such weak acids and bases will alter the acid base balance in the internal environment changes in acid base balance will lead to adverse effects such as denaturation of proteins therefore removal of excretory products from the body is essential to maintain the internal environment within favorable limits for effective body functioning and survival relationship between metabolic substrates and excretory products metabolic substrates in the cells are carbohydrates fats proteins and nucleic acids the excretory products of these substrates will vary depending on several factors such as the chemical structure and the composition availability of enzymes oxygen availability and the habitat in which they live when carbohydrates are metabolized within the body cells when oxygen is available final excretory end products are co2 and water if they are subjected to anaerobic respiration in general lactic acid is produced when fats are subjected to aerobic metabolism final excretory products are co2 and water since proteins contain amine groups in their structure during metabolism of excess amino acids ammonia is produced since nucleic acids contain nitrogenous bases ammonia is produced as an excretory product during their metabolism depending on the habitat and the availability of enzymes ammonia will be further converted to other nitrogenous waste products such as urea and uric acid relationship between the nitrogenous excretory products and living environment nitrogenous excretory products of animals are ammonia uric acid and urea these different forms vary significantly in their toxicity and the energy costs of producing them since ammonia is highly toxic a large volume of water is needed to excrete ammonia therefore typically the organisms that live in water such as bony fishes many aquatic invertebrates and aquatic amphibians specially tadpoles excrete ammonia since they have ready access to water energy cost for producing ammonia for excretion is comparatively low terrestrial animals do not have access to sufficient water to excrete ammonia as the main excretory product instead most terrestrial animals such as mammals and adult amphibians mainly excrete urea as the main nitrogenous excretory product urea is less toxic however animals must expend more energy to produce urea from ammonia some marine fishes such as sharks also excrete urea which they use for osmoregulation as the main nitrogenous waste some terrestrial animals such as birds many reptiles land snails and insects excrete uric acid as the main excretory product uric acid is relatively nontoxic and generally insoluble in water therefore it is excreted as a semisolid with trace amount of water however uric acid production from ammonia requires more energy than urea production the diversity of excretory structures of animals fine structures are not necessary body surface the cells of some animals which are in direct contact with the environment and eliminate excretory products by diffusion eg cnidarians flame cells these are specialized excretory cells connected to a network of tubule which opens to the outside of the animal eg flatworms nephridia they are multi cellular tubular structures one end of the tubule is open to the coelom while the other end opens to the outside eg annelids malpighian tubules these are extensive blind end tubules immersed in hemolymph and opens in to the digestive tract eg insects and other terrestrial arthropods malpighian tubules these are extensive blind end tubules immersed in hemolymph and opens in to the digestive tract eg insects and other terrestrial arthropods green glands antennal glands two large glands found ventrally in the head and anterior to the oesophagus eg crustaceans sweat glands there are coiled tubular glands situated in the dermis and connected to a sweat duct which open as a pore on the surface of the skin eg human skin salt glands they are paired glands found near the eyes to excrete excess salts eg marine birds and marine reptiles kidney these are the major excretory and osmoregulatory organs of all vertebrates human urinary system human urinary system consists of two kidneys two ureters urinary bladder and urethra summary of the main functions of the parts involved in the urinary system kidney produces urine to excrete waste products while maintaining osmotic balance and acidbase balance ureter transports urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder urinary bladder provides temporary storage for urine urethra acts as the passage through which urine stored in the bladder is expelled from the body location of kidneys two kidneys are located on the posterior abdominal wall one on either side of the vertebral column behind the peritoneum and below the diaphragm right kidney is slightly lower than the left blood supply the kidneys receive blood from aorta via the renal arteries and renal veins return blood to the inferior vena cava gross structure of the kidney kidney is a bean shaped organ which is held in position by a mass of fat and both are surrounded by a fibrous connective tissue in the longitudinal section of the kidney three areas of tissues can be seen to the naked eye they are outer fibrous capsule renal cortex and inner renal medulla cortex and medulla are supplied with blood vessels and tightly packed with excretory tubules renal cortex is granulated due to the presence of glomeruli medulla is composed of renal pyramids which have striated appearance apices of pyramids project in to the renal pelvis through renal papillae renal pelvis leads into the ureter renal artery and renal vein pass through the pelvis,osmoregulation is the process by which organisms manage solute concentrations and water balance unicellular organisms like amoeba use contractile vacuoles for osmoregulation while animals have developed various structures excretion is the removal of toxic waste products from metabolism distinct from defecation which involves undigested food maintaining a stable internal environment is crucial for animal survival key points include osmoregulation balancing water and solute levels to prevent cell damage excretion eliminating nitrogenous wastes eg ammonia urea uric acid to prevent toxicity nitrogenous waste products vary based on habitat aquatic animals excrete ammonia while terrestrial animals often excrete urea or uric acid excretory structures include body surfaces flame cells nephridia malpighian tubules green glands sweat glands salt glands and kidneys the human urinary system comprises two kidneys ureters a urinary bladder and a urethra crucial for urine production and waste elimination
nephron is the structural and functional unit of the kidney there are over millions of nephrons in each kidney there are two types of nephrons they are cortical nephrons reach short distance to the medulla and juxta medullary nephrons extend deep into the medulla majority of the nephrons are cortical nephrons a nephron consists of a single long tubule and a ball of capillaries called the glomerulus the tubule is closed at one end forming bowmans capsule which surrounds the glomerulus the other end of the tubule joins with the collecting duct tubule consists of bowmans capsule proximal convoluted tubule loop of henle distal convoluted tubule bowmans capsule glomerular capsule this is expanded and closed end of the tubular structure of the nephron it is a cup shaped and double walled structure inner layer of bowmans capsule consists of a single layer of flattened epithelial cells specialized for filtration outer layer of the bowmans capsule composed of simple squamous epithelium space between the inner and outer layers is known as capsular space which is responsible for receiving of glomerular filtrate the glomerular filtrate pass through three major tubular regions of the nephron proximal convoluted tubule loop of henle and distal convoluted tubule glomerulus the glomerulus is a ball of capillaries which is surrounded by bowmans capsule the nephron is supplied with blood from the afferent arteriole the blood vessel leaving away from the glomerulus is the efferent arteriole the efferent arteriole has a smaller diameter than the afferent arteriole this modification is important for increasing blood pressure in the glomerulus for ultrafiltration the efferent arteriole form two capillary networks one form the peritubular capillaries which surrounds the proximal and distal convoluted tubules and the other network form the vasa recta which extend towards the medulla surrounding the loop of henle proximal convoluted tubule it is comparatively longer and wider than the distal convoluted tubule this is lined by simple epithelium which has been specialized for selective reabsorption of substances nutrients ions and water from the glomerular filtrate loop of henle it is a u shaped part of the nephron with descending limb and ascending limb which are lined by simple epithelium lining of the descending limb of loop of henle is specialized for water reabsorption as it allows free movement of water but lining of the ascending limb of loop of henle is impermeable to water distal convoluted tubule it is lined by simple epitheliam which has been specialized for selective reabsorption of specific ions and water it leads into collecting duct main steps in urine formation there are 3 processes involved in urine formation they are ultrafi ltration selective reabsorption secretion ultra fi ltration filtration of the blood under high pressure into the cavity of the bowmans capsule is called ultrafiltration filtration occurs through the capillary walls of glomerulus and inner wall of bowmans capsule blood capillaries of glomerulus are porous and cells lining the bowmans capsule are specialized for filtration of small size molecules and ions these specializations allow passage of water and small solutes through the blood capillary walls into the bowmans capsule but due to their large size blood cells platelets and large molecules such as plasma proteins do not pass into the bowmans capsule the filtrate in the bowmans capsule contains salts amino acids glucose vitamins nitrogenous wastes and other small molecules the composition of the glomerular filtrate is similar in composition to plasma with exceptions of blood cells platelets and plasma proteins selective reabsorption the process through which useful molecules ions and water from the glomerular filtrate are recovered and returned to the interstitial fluid and then into capillary network of the tubules is called selective reabsorption most of the reabsorption from the glomerular filtrate back into the blood takes place in the convoluted tubule ions water and valuable nutrients are reabsorbed either active or passive transport from initial filtrate secretion the process by which foreign materials and substances not required to the body including waste are cleared from the peritubular capillaries and interstitial fluid into the filtrate is called secretion secretion is required because such substances may not be entirely filtered due to the short time they remain in the glomerulus substances that are secreted in to the filtrate include h nh3 creatinine drugs eg penicillin aspirin and excess k tubular secretion of h and nh3 are important to maintain the normal ph in the blood by formation of nh4 in the urine nh 3 can combine with h to form nh4 secretion occurs in the proximal and distal convoluted tubules secretion may be either active or passive depending on the location and or the substance,the nephron is the kidneys structural and functional unit with millions present in each kidney there are two types cortical nephrons which extend short distances into the medulla and juxtamedullary nephrons which penetrate deeper each nephron comprises bowmans capsule a cupshaped structure enclosing the glomerulus featuring an inner layer specialized for filtration glomerulus a ball of capillaries where blood is filtered ultrafiltration occurs here under high pressure allowing small molecules to pass into bowmans capsule while preventing larger components like blood cells and proteins proximal convoluted tubule responsible for selective reabsorption of nutrients ions and water loop of henle has descending and ascending limbs facilitating water reabsorption in the descending limb and ion reabsorption in the ascending limb distal convoluted tubule further selectively reabsorbs ions and water before joining the collecting duct urine formation involves three main processes ultrafiltration filtration of blood into bowmans capsule selective reabsorption recovery of essential substances back into the bloodstream secretion transfer of waste substances from blood to filtrate
glomerular filtrate in the bowmans capsule which contains all the substances in the blood except blood cells platelets and large molecules pass to the proximal convoluted tubule at this region selective reabsorption of ions water and valuable nutrients from the initial filtrate occurs nutrients especially glucose and amino acids are actively transported to the interstitial fluid cells lining the tubule actively transport na into the interstitial fluid and this transfer a positive charge out of the tubule drives the passive transport of cl proximal tubule also reabsorbs k and most of the hco3 by passive transport reabsorption of hco3 in the filtrate contributes to the ph balance in body fluids as solutes move from the filtrate to interstitial fluid water is reabsorbed passively by osmosis a major portion of water reabsorption from the filtrate occurs at this site as the filtrate pass through the proximal convoluted tubule secretion of specific substances into the filtrate takes place cells lining the tubule secrete h by active transport and ammonia by passive transport into the lumen of the tubule secreted ammonia act as a buffer to trap h forming nh4 in addition some materials such as drugs and toxins that have been metabolized in the liver are actively secreted into the lumen of the proximal convoluted tubule as a result of water reabsorption and secretion of different substances the filtrate becomes more concentrated as it passes through the proximal convoluted tubule as the filtrate moves into the descending limb of loop of henle passive reabsorption of water through osmosis continues and filtrate becomes more concentrated the filtrate reaches the ascending limb of the loop of henle via the tip of the loop ascending limb is impermeable to water so that no water absorption takes place but a considerable amount of nacl reabsorption occurs at this site most of the na is transported into the interstitial fluid by active transport as a result of losing nacl but not water the filtrate become more diluted as it moves towards the distal convoluted tubule the distal convoluted tubule plays an important role in regulating k and nacl concentration of body fluids the amount of k secreted by active transport into the filtrate and the amount of nacl by active transport reabsorbed from the filtrate can be varied at this site according to the needs of the body distal tubule also contributes to ph regulation by controlled secretion of h and reabsorption of hco3 at the distal convoluted tubule passive water reabsorption can be increased under the influence of antidiuretic hormone adh to form concentrated urine aldesterone secreted by the adrenal gland stimulates increase reabsorption of na and water and excretion of k this filtrate of the distal convoluted tubule finally leads to the collecting duct as the filtrate pass along the collecting duct filtrate become concentrated and urine is formed at this site water reabsorption can also be increased under the influence of adh and urine become more concentrated aldesterone hormone stimulates active reabsorption of na and passive reabsorption of water at the collecting duct because of the high urea concentration in the filtrate at this region some urea diffuses into the interstitial fluid final processing of the filtrate at the collecting duct forms the urine when producing dilute urine the kidney actively reabsorb salts without allowing water to be reabsorbed by osmosis role of kidney in homeostasis maintaining electrolyte and water balance in the body fluids osmoregulation excretion of toxic waste products from the body regulating blood ph through acid base balance controlling blood volume and blood pressure secretion of erythropoeitein hormone that stimulates red blood cell production production and secretion of renin an enzyme important in control of blood pressure disorders related to human urinary system bladder and kidney stones these are formed due to precipitation of urinary constituents usually oxalates and phosphates normally in urine they are also called renal calculi causes include dehydration due to not drinking sufficient amount of fluids alkaline nature of urine infections that can alter ph of urine metabolic condition family history measures for prevention drinking plenty of water kidney failure this is due to the inability of the kidneys to function properly therefore waste products and excess fluid will be accumulated in the blood reasons for kidney failure diabetes high blood pressure having family history getting older chronic kidney disease ckd it is a condition of gradual loss of kidney function over time there are many reasons for kidney failure diabetes high blood pressure having family history getting older prevent ckd follow a low salt low fat diet doing proper exercise having regular check ups prevent smoking dialysis dialysis is done for the patients with kidney failure it is a process of removing excretory products excess solutes and toxins from the blood by an artificial method chronic kidney disease of unknownuncertain etiology ckdu in sri lanka it is a condition of gradual loss of kidney function over time the root cause of ckdu has not been definitively established yet hence it is referred to as chronic kidney disease of unknownuncertain etiology however it is a different form of chronic kidney disease ckd which is associated with conventional risk factors such as diabetes and high blood pressure genetic disorders and urinary tract problems the onset of the disease appears to be asymptomatic and by the time the patient seeks treatment the kidneys have reached a stage of irreversible damage end stage renal disease esrd in sri lanka initially ckdu was prevalent among rural communities in north central province medawachchiya kabithigollawa padaviya medirigiriya regions uva girandurukotte eastern provinces dehiattakandiya ckdu is also reported in north western southern and central provinces and parts of the northern province of the island hypothesized reasons for ckdu cause of ckdu seems to be multifactorial exposure to heavy metal metaloid such as arsenic as and cadmium cd through food and water usage of low quality utensils for preparation of foods high flouride f levels in water exposure to pesticides genetic factors malnutrition and dehydration,the nephron is the functional unit of the kidney consisting of a glomerulus and a long tubule including bowmans capsule proximal convoluted tubule loop of henle and distal convoluted tubule urine formation involves three key processes ultrafiltration blood is filtered under high pressure in bowmans capsule producing glomerular filtrate selective reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubule valuable substances like glucose ions and water are reabsorbed into the blood secretion waste products eg h nh3 creatinine are secreted into the tubule to maintain homeostasis the kidneys regulate electrolyte balance blood ph blood volume and pressure and secrete hormones like erythropoietin disorders include kidney stones kidney failure and chronic kidney disease ckd ckd of unknown etiology ckdu is a significant health issue in sri lanka with hypothesized causes including heavy metal exposure and poor nutrition
coordination between stimuli and responses is needed to maintain constant internal environment inside the body of an organism for existence systems contributing to coordination animals unlike plants have two different but related systems for coordination of body function they are the nervous system and the endocrine system similarities and differences in relation to coordination of the nervous system and endocrine system nervous coordination and hormonal coordination are two distinct systems that regulate the bodys functions nervous coordination transmits signals through neurons utilizing both chemical and electrical impulses leading to rapid and localized responses in contrast hormonal coordination relies on chemicals hormones transported through the bloodstream resulting in more diffuse and sloweracting effects while nervous coordination initiates fast responses that are typically short in duration hormonal coordination produces longerlasting effects but takes more time to start both systems work together to maintain the bodys overall balance and functionality organization of nervous systems in different animals phyla animals have specialized systems of neurons to sense their surroundings and respond rapidly in the animal kingdom cnidarians are the simplest animals having a nervous system they have a diffuse nerve net which is composed of interconnected individual neurons in more complex animals the nervous systems contain groups of neurons organized into nerves and often ganglia and a brain in some platyhelminthes such as planaria the nervous system contains a pair of ganglia in the anterior region brain and a pair of longitudinal nerve cords in planarians the eye spots which are located near the ganglia act as photoreceptors annelids and arthropods have somewhat complicated brains and ventral nerve cords the ventral nerve cord contains ganglia they are segmentally arranged the nervous system of echinodermates is composed of radial nerves and a nerve ring the nervous system of the chordates consists of a central nervous system cns and a peripheral nervous system pns the cns is composed of the brain and the spinal cord the pns is composed of nerves and ganglia different organism phyla and their nervous organization in various phyla the nervous system exhibits different levels of organization in cnidaria a simple nerve net is present as seen in hydra the platyhelminthes phylum such as planaria has a brain and longitudinal nerve cords providing a more centralized form of control annelida exemplified by the leech features a brain a ventral nerve cord and segmental ganglia which help coordinate movement in segmented bodies arthropoda like the cockroach also possesses a brain and ventral nerve cord along with segmental ganglia for efficient body coordination echinodermata such as the sea star have a nerve ring and radial nerves that help manage their radial symmetry finally in chordata represented by the gecko the nervous system is highly developed consisting of a brain and a dorsal nerve cord spinal cord facilitating complex motor and sensory functions the gross structure and the functions of the human nervous system organization and main parts of the human nervous system human nervous system consists of central and peripheral nervous systems in vertebrates the brain and the spinal cord form the central nervous system nerves and ganglia form the main components of the peripheral nervous system the human nervous system is divided into two main components the central nervous system cns and the peripheral nervous system pns 1 central nervous system cns this includes the brain and spinal cord the cns is responsible for processing information and sending out instructions to the body acting as the control center for all functions 2 peripheral nervous system pns the pns consists of all the nerves outside the cns which connect the cns to the rest of the body it is further divided into three parts a cranial nerves which originate from the brain b spinal nerves which arise from the spinal cord c ganglia outside cns which are clusters of nerve cell bodies that help relay signals between the cns and peripheral nerves together these systems ensure the coordination of the bodys sensory inputs and motor responses,coordination in organisms is crucial for maintaining internal balance accomplished by the nervous and endocrine systems nervous system involves rapid signal transmission through neurons enabling fast and localized responses using both electrical and chemical impulses endocrine system uses hormones transported via the bloodstream for slower more widespread effects resulting in longerlasting responses different animal phyla exhibit varying nervous system organizations cnidarians have a simple nerve net while platyhelminthes like planaria possess a brain and longitudinal nerve cords annelids eg leeches and arthropods eg cockroaches have more complex systems with a brain ventral nerve cord and segmental ganglia echinoderms feature radial nerves and a nerve ring while chordates eg geckos possess a highly developed brain and spinal cord the human nervous system is divided into the central nervous system cns comprising the brain and spinal cord and the peripheral nervous system pns consisting of nerves and ganglia that connect the cns to the body
central nervous system consists of the brain and the spinal cord in vertebrates the cns develops from the hollow dorsal nerve cord during embryonic development the anterior part of the central nervous system enlarges and forms the brain which has three major regions forebrain midbrain and hindbrain the central canal in the brain forms four irregularly shaped cavities called ventricles the brain contains four ventricles three ventricles are present in the fore brain and one ventricle is in the hind brain this central canal continues in the spinal cord the ventricles and central canal contain cerebrospinal fluid this fluid helps to maintain uniform pressure within the cns and acts as a shock absorber between the brain and skull it also helps to circulate nutrients and hormones as well as to remove waste products the brain and the spinal cord have several adaptations to be protected from physical injuries the brain is enclosed by a skull the spinal cord is surrounded by vertebrae which forms the vertebral column further protection to the cns is given by three layers of tissues called the meninges the outermost layer is called the dura mater the innermost layer as pia mater and in between these two layers is the arachnoid mater main parts of the human brain the forebrain midbrain and hindbrain of the human embryo develop into the adult brain the forebrain gives rise to the cerebrum thalamus hypothalamus and pineal body the mid brain gives rise to part of the brain stem the hind brain gives rise to cerebellum pons varolii and medulla oblongata the brain stem consists of the midbrain pons varolii and medulla oblongata cerebrum cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain it is divided by a deep cleft into right and left cerebral hemispheres the superficial part of the cerebrum is composed of nerve cell bodies or grey matter forming the cerebral cortex and deeper layers consist of nerve fibers or white matter the two cerebral hemispheres are connected by corpus callosum which is a mass of white matter the cerebral cortex shows many infoldings to increase the surface area of the cerebrum the cortex of each cerebral hemisphere is divided into four lobes frontal lobe temporal lobe parietal lobe and occipital lobe three main functional areas o1the cerebral cortex has been identified they are sensory areas which receive and process sensory information including the perception of pain temperature touch sight hearing taste and smell association areas which are responsible for recognition and interpretation of sensory information and integration and processing of complex mental functions such as memory intelligence reasoning judgment and emotions motor areas which are responsible for directing skeletal voluntary muscle movement through the initiation and control of voluntary muscle contraction thalamus thalamus is situated within the cerebral hemispheres just below the corpus callosum it consists of two masses comprising grey and white matter functions thalamus acts as the main input center of sensory information from special sense organs and sensory receptors in the skin and internal organs this sensory information is sorted and directed to specific location of the cerebral cortex for further processing and perception the thalamus relays and redistributes nerve impulses from most parts of the brain to cerebral cortex hypothalamus hypothalamus is situated below and in front of the thalamus immediately above the pituitary gland it is linked to the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland by nerve fibers and to the anterior lobe by a complex system of blood vessels functions regulates body temperature regulates thirst and water balance regulates appetite regulate sleep and wake cycles control of autonomic nervous system initiates fightorflight response sourceforposteriorpituitaryhormonesandreleasinghormonesthatacton anterior pituitary plays role in sexual behaviors mid brain mid brain is the upperpart of the brain stem it is situated between the cerebrum above and the ponsvarolii below surrounding the cerebrospinal fluid filled connection of the third and fourth ventricles the mid brain contains aggregates of nerve cell bodies and nerve tracts which connect the cerebrum with the lower brain and spinal cord functions acts as relay stations for ascending and descending nerve fibers receives and integrates sensory information auditory and visual and sends it to particular regions of the forebrain coordinates auditory and visual reflexes ponsvarolii ponsvaroliia part of the brainstem is located in front of the cerebellum below the mid brain and above them edullaoblongata it contains nerve fibers that form bridges between thetwo hemispheres of the cerebellum it also contains nerve fibers passing between higher levels of the brain and spinal cord groups of nerve cell bodies in the pons varolii form centers that regulate respiration some nerve cell bodies in the pons act as relay stations functions transfers information between pns and the midbrain and forebrain coordinates large scale body movements such as climbing and running together with the medulla oblongata it helps regulate respiration medulla oblongata medulla oblongata is the lowest part of the brain stem which extends from the pons varolii above and is continuous with the spinal cord below it consists of cardiovascular centre respiratory center and reflex centers functions transfers information between pns and the mid brain and the fore brain coordinates large scale body movements such as running climbing controls several autonomic homeostatic functions including breathing heart and blood vessel activities contains respiratory center cardiovascular center controls involuntary reflexes such as vomiting swallowing coughing sneezing through reflex centers cerebellum cerebellum is located behind the pons varolii and below the posterior portion of the cerebrum it is also made up of two hemispheres functions coordinates voluntary muscular movements maintains posture and balance helps in learning and remembering motor skill spinal cord the spinal cord is an elongated cylindrical structure suspended in the vertebral canal it is continuous with the medulla oblongata centre of the spinal cord contains the central canal which is surrounded by grey matter the outer region of the spinal cord is made up of white matter functions links the central nervous systems to sensory and motor neurons and facilitates nerve impulse propagation towards the brain and away the brain coordinates and produces reflexes,the central nervous system cns in vertebrates comprises the brain and spinal cord developing from the dorsal nerve cord during embryonic development the brain has three major regions forebrain cerebrum thalamus hypothalamus midbrain and hindbrain cerebellum pons varolii medulla oblongata with four ventricles that contain cerebrospinal fluid csf for cushioning and nutrient circulation key functions of brain parts include cerebrum processes sensory information coordinates voluntary movement and is divided into lobes frontal temporal parietal occipital thalamus relays sensory information to the cerebral cortex hypothalamus regulates temperature appetite sleep cycles and autonomic functions midbrain integrates auditory and visual information coordinating reflexes pons varolii bridges communication between brain regions and regulates respiration medulla oblongata controls autonomic functions like heart rate and breathing cerebellum coordinates voluntary movements and maintains balance spinal cord links the cns to peripheral nerves facilitating reflexes and nerve impulse propagation
peripheral nervous system is made up of cranial nerves spinal nerves and autonomic nervous system with ganglia it transmits impulses to and from cns regulating both an animals movement and its internal environment sensory information from sensory receptors reaches the cns along pns neurons referred to as afferent neurons sensory neurons within the cns this information is processed and instructions are transmitted to effector tissuesorgans muscles glands and endocrine cells along pns neurons referred to as efferent neurons motor neurons pns consists of two efferent components e the motor system it consists of neurons that carry nerve impulses to skeletal muscles so it controls voluntary activities e autonomic nervous system it generally controls the involuntary activities of the body autonomic nervous system consists of neurons which carry impulses to control activities of smooth muscles cardiac muscles and glands autonomic nervous system consists mainly of two divisions e sympathetic division e parasympathetic division sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system the majority of the body organs are supplied by both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves which have antagonistic opposite functions sympathetic stimulations prepare the body to deal with exciting stressful situations and energy generating situations fight or flight parasympathetic division causes opposite responses that promote calming or a return to selfmaintenance functions rest and stimulate digestion and food absorption the two divisions differ in overall functions organization and the signal released parasympathetic nerves exit the cns at the base of the brain or the spinal cord as cranial nerves or spinal nerves respectively on the other hand sympathetic nerves exist only from the spinal cord different neurotransmitters enable the two systems to bring about two opposite effects in different organs such as lung heart intestine and bladder for example when the neurotransmitter secreted by the parasympathetic division is acetylcholine the sympathetic division secretes norepinephrine how nerve impulses are generated and transmitted in all cells including neurons ions are distributed unequally between the cell interior and exterior extra cellular fluid generally the inside of the cell is negatively charged whereas the exterior is positively charged opposite charges are attracted across the plasma membrane and as a result it creates a voltage difference across the membrane that is referred to as membrane potential resting potential when a neuron is at rest when not sending a signalnon conducting the membrane potential voltage difference across the membrane is called the resting potential in a nonconducting neuron the resting potential is typically between 60 mv and 80 mv the resting membrane potential is maintained by e distribution of ion concentrations inside and outside of the neuron in a non conducting neuron the concentration of k is higher inside the cell while concentration of na is higher outside there are large anions proteins inside the cell in addition to some ci ions as a result a neuron has a negative charge inside the cell and positive charge outside the cell e selective permeability of the plasma membrane to k and na ions there are leaky potassium channels and sodium channels which are membrane bound proteins potassium channels allow only k ions to pass whereas sodium channels allow only na to pass these channels are leaky and allow k and nato diffuse according to their concentration gradient however there are more leaky potassium channels open than sodium channels these potassium channels allow net outflow of potassium due to chemical concentration gradient however sodium ions and other ions cannot readily cross the membrane as a result there is a net negative charge inside the cell e sodiumpotassium pump this pump helps to maintain na and k gradient across the membrane by transporting three na out of the cell for every two k that it transports in this pump uses atp to actively transport these ions action potential an action potential occurs due to a change in membrane potential above a certain value threshold value due to a stimulus the action potential has the following phases depolarization repolarization and hyperpolarization depolarization a change in the cells membrane potential such that the inside of the membrane is made less negative relative to the outside depolarization results due to na inflow from the sodium channels bound to plasma membrane in response to a stimulus repolarization sodium channels close blocking na inflow however most potassium channels open permitting k outflow this makes the inside of the cell negative hyperpolarization sodium channels are closed but potassium channels are opened as a result the inside of the membrane is more negative refractory period refractory period is the short time immediately after an action potential in which the neuron cannot respond to another stimulus owing to the inactivation of sodium channels this prevents the reverse conduction of an impulse in an axon conduction of action potential nerve impulse a series of action potentials that move along an axon is defined as a nerve impulse an action potential is generated due to nanoflow depolarization at one location in the axon this axon potential spreads to the neighboring location while the initial location repolarizes this depolarizationrepolarization process is repeated through the axon the speed of conduction depends on diameter of the axon the conduction speed increases with the increase in axon diameter presence of myelinated axon in myelinated neuron axon potential jumps from one node of ranvier to the next synapses a synapse is the junction where a neuron presynaptic cell communicates with another cell postsynaptic cell across a narrow gap synaptic cleft postsynaptic cells may be another neuron muscle cells or secretory cells this junction where one neuron communicates with the next cell using a chemical neurotransmitter is called a chemical synapse some neurons can also communicate through direct electrical connections electrical synapse,the peripheral nervous system pns consists of cranial nerves spinal nerves and the autonomic nervous system ans which regulates movement and internal body functions the pns has two main components motor system controls voluntary muscle movements autonomic nervous system ans regulates involuntary functions and is divided into sympathetic division prepares the body for stressful situations fightorflight parasympathetic division promotes calmness and digestion nerve impulses are generated when there is a change in membrane potential leading to action potentials that consist of three phases depolarization na inflow repolarization k outflow and hyperpolarization the refractory period follows an action potential during which the neuron cannot respond to stimuli conduction speed is affected by axon diameter and myelination synapses are junctions where neurons communicate using neurotransmitters for chemical synapses or direct electrical connections for electrical synapses
an action potential at an axon terminal depolarizes the plasma membrane of presynaptic cell depolarization at the presynaptic terminal causes ca to diffuse into the terminals the rise in ca causes binding of synaptic vesicles containing neurotransmitters to the presynaptic membrane this results in the release of the neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft neurotransmitters diffuse across the synaptic cleft neurotransmitters bind and activate specific receptors in the postsynaptic cell membrane e if acetylcholine is taken for example of a neurotransmitter the binding of neurotransmitters to the post synaptic membrane allows na and k to diffuse across the post synaptic membrane depolarization takes place in the post synaptic membrane and it reaches the action potential after passing the nerve impulse to the postsynaptic cell the signal at the presynaptic terminals is terminated either by enzymatic hydrolysis of neurotransmitter recapture of neurotransmitter into the presynaptic terminals neurotransmitters neurotransmitters are the molecules that are released from the synaptic terminals of presynaptic neuron and diffuse across the synaptic cleft bind to the receptors at the postsynaptic membrane triggering a response common neurotransmitters are acetylcholine some amino acids biogenic amines neuropeptides some gases reflex arc reflex arcs are the functional unit of the vertebrate nervous system typically a reflex arc consists of three neurons they are 1 afferent sensory neuron 2 interneuron 3 efferent motor neuron a sensory neuron transmits impulses from a sensory receptor to the central nervous system where it synapses with an associated neuron called interneuron this impulse is transmitted to a motor neuron the motor neuron conveys the signal to effector tissuesorgans common disorders of the nervous system common disorders of the nervous system are schizophrenia depression alzheimers disease and parkinsons disease schizophrenia this is a severe mental disturbance characterized by psychotic episodes in which patients have a distorted perception of reality they experience voices that only they can hear they think that others are plotting to harm them evidence suggests that this disorder affects neural pathways that use dopamine as a neurotransmitter depression depression is likely to be due to a complex combination of factors that include changes in neurotransmitter levels in the brain genetics psychological social environmental factors people who are suffering from this disorder show depressed mood abnormalities in sleep appetite and energy level in some conditions once enjoyable activities are no longer pleasurable or interesting some conditions involve extreme mood swings effective therapies are available to increase activity of some neurotransmitters in the brain alzheimers disease this is a severe mental deterioration dementia characterized by confusion and memory loss patients are gradually becoming less able to dress bathe and feed themselves they lose their ability to recognize people including their immediate family members the cause of the disease is due to progressive and irreversible degeneration of neurons in the brain especially in cerebral cortex with deteriorating mental functioning the disease affects elderly people genetic factors may be involved so far there is no cure for this disease parkinson disease this is a progressive motor disorder that leads to lack of control and coordination of muscle movements the patients show slowness of movements difficulty initiating movements poor balance fixed muscle tone causing lack of facial expression speech problems and muscle tremor of extremities eg shaking a hand fingers in one hand shaking head this disease is associated with gradual degeneration of dopamine neurotransmitter releasing neurons in the brain mid brain basal ganglia the disease is common in the elderly people genetic factors may be involved disease can be treated but not cured,neurotransmitters are molecules released from presynaptic neurons that diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to receptors on postsynaptic membranes triggering responses the process involves action potential depolarization at the axon terminal causes ca to enter the presynaptic terminal leading to the release of neurotransmitters binding neurotransmitters bind to postsynaptic receptors allowing na and k to diffuse across the membrane causing depolarization and potentially reaching action potential termination signals are terminated by enzymatic hydrolysis or recapture of neurotransmitters reflex arcs consist of three neurons sensory afferent interneuron and motor efferent neurons enabling quick responses to stimuli common disorders schizophrenia characterized by distorted reality and dopamine pathway disruption depression involves neurotransmitter level changes and various psychological factors alzheimers disease causes memory loss and cognitive decline due to neuron degeneration parkinsons disease affects motor control linked to the loss of dopamineproducing neurons
a sensory receptor is a specialized structure which can detect a specific stimulus and convert the stimulus energy to a changing membrane potential to be transmitted to the central nervous system as action potentials for sensory perception and interpretation sensory receptor can be a specialized cell or an organ or a subcellular structure that could detect the stimuli some sensory cells are specialized neurons sensory receptors can inform the central nervous system about the conditions inside and outside the body in order to maintain homeostasis specific sensory receptors detect the stimuli that arise in the external environment whereas internal receptors sense the stimuli that arise inside the body basic characteristic of sensory receptors a specialized structure cell organ subcellular structure designed to receive a specific stimuli detect the stimulus if the stimulus is at or above threshold level convert the energy of the stimulus eg light energy sound energy into a changing membrane potential to be later transmitted as an action potential always connected with the nervous system during the conversion of stimulus energy into the action potential sensory signal can be strengthened which is called amplification if the stimulation is continuous many receptors show decrease in responsiveness which is called sensory adaptation for example upon continuous exposure to a strong smell perception of that smell gradually decreases and stops within few minutes types of sensory receptors sensory receptors can be categorized based on the nature of the stimulus they detect several types of sensory receptors are found in the human body they are chemoreceptors thermoreceptors photoreceptors mechanoreceptors and pain receptors chemoreceptors these are sensory receptors that respond to chemical stimuli chemical substances should always be dissolved in water to stimulate sensory cells chemoreceptors include taste receptors and olfactory receptors these receptors mediate the senses of taste and sinell some chemoreceptors can detect specific chemicalssuchasco2 in the circulating blood tast ereceptors five basics enations of taste have been end escribed sweet sour bitter salt and umami savory taste receptor cells for taste are modified epithelial cells organized into taste buds tastebuds are found in papillae which are small projections of the tongue a taste bud consists of taste cells supporting cells and sensory nerve endings substances to be tasted should be dissolved in the fluid surrounding the sensory cells and diffuse to receptor cells olfactory receptors in olfaction receptor cells are neurons olfactory receptor cells are located within the epithelium of the upper portion of the nasal cavity receptive ends of the cells extend into the mucus layer of the nasal cavity when odorants diffuse into this region receptor cells are stimulated and the nerve impulse is sent along their axons to them olfactory bulb in the brain thermoreceptors thermoreceptors are specialized temperature sensitive receptors which detect heat and cold on the body surface and in the internal environment of the body thermoreceptors located in the skin detect the body surface temperature whereas thermoreceptors found in hypothalamus detects the temperature of the blood circulating through the internal organs core temperature thermoreceptors found in the skin a rare rause end bulbs detect cold ruffini corpuscles detect warmth and free nerve endings detect both cold and warmth thermoreceptors found in the hypothalamus are specialized neurons photoreceptors photoreceptors are sensitive to light humans have two main types of photoreceptor cells called rods and cones rods they are more sensitive to light but do not distinguish colours they enable us to see at night but only in black and white cones they provide color vision but they contribute very little to night vision as they are not very sensitive there are three types of cones each has a different sensitivity across the visible spectrum providing an optimal response to red green or blue light mechanoreceptors mechanoreceptors respond to stimuli arising from mechanical energy deformation such as pressure touch stretch motion and sound mechanoreceptors in the human body include the following touch receptors they are mostly present close to the surface of the skin examples for touch receptors are meissner corpuscles sensitive to light pressure merkel discs sensitive to light touch and free nerve endings pressure receptors example for pressure receptors are pacinian corpuscles which are present in the deep skin they are sensitive to deep pressure vibration receptors most of the touch receptors can also detect vibrations eg meissner corpuscles pacinian corpuscles specific hair cells in the organ of corti in the inner ear detect sound vibrations hair cells of the vestibule of the inner ear detect gravity whereas hair cells of the semicircular canals detect motion pain receptors pain receptors detect stimuli that reflect harmful conditions that could arise from extreme pressure or temperature and certain chemicals that could damage the tissues special nerve endings in different parts of the body can detect tissue damage ultimately the pain is perceived by the brain,sensory receptors are specialized structures that detect specific stimuli and convert their energy into action potentials for sensory perception they can be specialized cells organs or subcellular structures and play a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis by informing the central nervous system about internal and external conditions characteristics of sensory receptors specialized structures designed for specific stimuli detect stimuli at or above threshold levels convert stimulus energy into changing membrane potentials action potentials connected to the nervous system can amplify sensory signals and exhibit sensory adaptation to continuous stimulation types of sensory receptors chemoreceptors respond to chemical stimuli eg taste and olfactory receptors thermoreceptors detect temperature changes eg cold and warmth receptors photoreceptors sensitive to light eg rods for lowlight vision and cones for color vision mechanoreceptors respond to mechanical stimuli eg touch pressure and sound pain receptors detect harmful stimuli and tissue damage
the eye is the organ responsible for sight there is a fine transparent membrane that lines the iris and front of the eyeball this is called conjunctiva the walls of the eye are made up of three layers of tissue the outer fibrous layer sclera and cornea the middle vascular layer choroid ciliary body and iris and the inner nervous layer retina inside the eyeball contains the lens aqueous fluid and vitreous body sclera and cornea sclera is white and opaque it is the outermost layer of the posterior and lateral aspects of the eyeball it connects anteriorly with the clear transparent epithelial membrane called cornea sclera maintains the shape of the eye and gives attachment of the extrinsic muscles of the eye cornea is the passage through which light rays reach the retina it is devoid of blood vessels the cornea is convex anteriorly and is involved in refracting light rays to focus on the retina choroid ciliary body and iris choroid is located just beneath the sclera it is a thin pigmented layer and rich with blood vessels ciliary body is the anterior continuation of the choroid layer consisting of smooth muscle fibers ciliary muscle and sensory epithelial cells most of these smooth muscle fibers are circular therefore ciliary muscles act as a sphincter the ciliary body holds the lens in place by suspensory ligaments the size and thickness of the lens can be controlled by contraction and relaxation of the ciliary muscle fibers attached to these suspensory ligaments epithelial cells secrete aqueous humor iris is a circular colored body composed of pigment cells it is located at the front of the eye it extends anteriorly from the ciliary body and is present behind the cornea and in front of the lens it contains two layers of smooth muscle fibers which are arranged as circular and radial bundles in the center of the iris is a hole called pupil the iris controls the amount of light entering the pupil by changing size which is mediated by the autonomic nervous system pigments prevent penetration of excessive light lens the lens is lying immediately behind the pupil it is an elastic biconvex transparent disc made up of protein enclosed within a transparent capsule it refracts light rays reflected by objects in front of the eye and focuses them on the retina to form the image by changing the thickness the lens can vary its refractive power in order to focus rays on the retina aqueous fluid aqueous humor and vitreous body vitreous humor in front of the lens a clear watery substance is present which is called aqueous fluid blockage of ducts that drain this fluid can produce glaucoma causing vision loss aqueous fluid supplies nutrients and removes waste from the cornea lens and lens capsule which have no blood supply behind the lens a colorless and transparent jelly like vitreous humor is present it maintains enough intra ocular pressure to support the retina against choroid and prevents the eyeball from collapsing retina retina is the innermost lining of the eye it consists of three layers outer pigmented epithelium middle photoreceptive layer and inner layer with neurons a photoreceptor layer consists of sensory cells rods and cones which contain photosensory pigments that can convert light rays into membrane potential change retina is thickest at the back at the center of the posterior part of the retina macula lutea yellow spot is present in the center of the yellow spot there is a little depression called the fovea centralis which contains only cones towards the anterior part of the retina there are fewer cones than rods about 05 cm to the nasal side of the macula lutea all the nerve fibers of the retina converge to form the optic nerve the small area of retina where the optic nerve leaves eye is the blind spot optic disk it lacks photoreceptors photoreceptor cells there are two types rods and cones within the outer segment of these cells is a stack of membranous disks in which visual pigments are embedded in the retina more rods are present than cones in the rods visual pigment is rhodopsin they are sensitive to light but do not distinguish colours they enable us to see at night but only in black and white in the cones visual pigment is photopsin they provide color vision they contribute very little to night vision as they are less sensitive there are three types of cones each of which has a different sensitivity across the visible spectrum providing an optimal response to red green or blue light neurons in the retina several types of neurons are present including bipolar cells and ganglion cells functioning of the human eyes light is reflected into the eye by the objects in the field of vision in order to achieve clear vision light reflected from the object within the visual field should be refracted mainly by the lens and focused on the retina of each eye the processes which are involved in producing a clear image on the retina are refraction of light rays changing the size of the pupil and accommodation then photoreceptor cells in the retina convert light energy to voltage changes leading to action potentials which are sent through the optic nerve to the brain for perception of visual objects in the retina stimulation of rods leads to black and white vision cones are sensitive to light and color therefore bright light is needed to activate them and give sharp clear color vision the different wavelengths of visible light activate light sensitive pigments in the cones which result in perception of different colours refraction of light rays light rays coming from the visual field pass through the conjunctiva first then successively through cornea aqueous fluid lens and vitreous body before reaching the retina during this process light rays are refracted bent to focus them on the retina as they all are denser than the air lens has changing refractory power while all the other parts conjunctiva cornea aqueous fluid and vitreous body have constant refractory powers light rays are mostly refracted by the biconvex lens changing the size of the pupil convergence and accommodation for clear vision the amount of light entering the eye is controlled by changing the size of the pupil which is mediated by the autonomic nervous system constriction of the pupil in bright light pupils are constricted to avoid entering too much light into the eye and damaging the sensitive retina in dim light the pupils are dilated to allow entering sufficient light to activate photoreceptors which would eventually enable the vision light rays coming from distant objects need least refraction but as the object comes closer the amount of refraction needs to be increased to focus light rays on the retina hence for near vision the eye must make some adjustments movement of the eyeball convergence as light rays from near objects enter the two eyes at different angles for clear vision they must stimulate corresponding areas of two retina muscles attached to the eyeball rotate the eyes to achieve convergence this is under autonomic control changing the refractory power of the lens parasympathetic nervous supply to the ciliary body controls the contraction of ciliary muscles and accommodation of eye accommodation is important in near vision for focusing on near objects in near vision the ciliary muscles contract thereby moving the ciliary body inwards towards lens as a result convexity of the lens is increased due to the reduction of the pull of the suspensory ligaments on the lens thus light waves from the near objects are focused on the retina when seeing a distant object ciliary muscles relax then ciliary body moves away from the lens that increases the pull of the suspensory ligaments on the lens so convexity of the lens is reduced thus light rays from distant objects are focused on the retina focusing the image on the retina and converting the light energy to action potential to be transmitted to the brain the light waves coming from the object are bent refracted and focused on the retina this process produces an image on the retina which is upside down once light rays reach the retina chemical changes happen in the photoreceptive cells rods and cones bipolar cells receive information from photoreceptor cells and each ganglion cell gathers inputs from several bipolar cells in addition specific neurons in the retina can integrate information across the retina ganglion cells form the optic nerve fibers that transmit sensation from the eyes as action potential to the brain this change will generate a nerve impulse the optic nerve transmits this nerve impulse into occipital lobes visual area of the cerebrum there the visual objects are perceived in the correct way the right way up by the brain choroid functions in absorption of light after the entered light stimulate sensory receptors in the retina,the eye is the organ of sight comprising three layers the outer fibrous layer sclera and cornea the middle vascular layer choroid ciliary body and iris and the inner nervous layer retina key structures include conjunctiva a transparent membrane lining the iris and front of the eyeball sclera the white opaque outer layer that maintains eye shape cornea a transparent layer that refracts light into the eye lens an elastic structure that focuses light on the retina by changing its thickness aqueous humor a watery substance that supplies nutrients and removes waste vitreous humor a jellylike substance that maintains intraocular pressure the retina contains photoreceptor cells rods and cones that convert light into electrical signals sent to the brain via the optic nerve important processes for vision include refraction of light pupil size adjustment and accommodation for focusing on objects at varying distances
in humans both eyes are located in front of the face which facilitates coordinate division from the two eyes however it is possible to see visual fields with one eye seeing the visual field using only one eye is called monocular vision however when one eye is issued threedimensional vision is impaired especially in relation to the judgment of speed and distance seeing the visual field using two eyes with greater overlapping fields of view is called binocular vision the left eye views more on the left of the visual fields the right eye views more on the right of the visual fields even though each eye views a scene from a slightly different angle in the middle the visual fields are overlapped however only one image is perceived due to the fusion of left middle and right of the visual field images from the two eyes in the occipital lobe of the cerebrum unlike monocular vision binocular vision enables three dimensional views so binocular vision is very important in judging the speed and distance of an approaching object such as a vehicle it gives a more accurate assessment of one object relative to another in relation to distance depth height and width in some individuals binocular vision may be impaired such individuals face difficulties judging the speed and distance of an approaching object monocular vision and binocular vision in human in humans both eyes are located in front of the face which facilitates coordinated vision from the two eyes however it is possible to see visual fields with one eye seeing the visual field using only one eye is called monocular vision however when one eye is used threedimensional vision is impaired especially in relation to the judgment of speed and distance seeing the visual field using two eyes with greater overlapping fields of view is called binocular vision the left eye views more on the left of the visual fields the right eye views more on the right of the visual fields even though each eye views a scene from a slightly different angle in the middle the visual fields are overlapped however only one image is perceived due to the fusion of left middle and right of the visual field images from the two eyes in the occipital lobe of the cerebrum unlike monocular vision binocular vision enables three dimensional views so binocular vision is very important in judging the speed and distance of an approaching object such as a vehicle it gives a more accurate assessment of one object relative to another in relation to distance depth height and width in some individuals binocular vision may be impaired such individuals face difficulties judging the speed and distance of an approaching object,in humans vision can occur through one eye monocular vision or both eyes binocular vision monocular vision this occurs when only one eye is used while it allows for visual perception it impairs threedimensional 3d vision affecting the ability to judge speed and distance binocular vision involves the coordinated use of both eyes providing greater overlapping visual fields the left eye primarily views the left visual field while the right eye focuses more on the right despite each eye seeing the scene from slightly different angles the images are fused in the occipital lobe of the brain resulting in a single visual perception binocular vision enables 3d perception essential for accurately judging the speed and distance of objects such as vehicles impairments in binocular vision can lead to difficulties in spatial judgment
human ear is divided into three parts the outer ear middle ear and inner ear outer wear consists of the piano and auditory canal auditory canal is a slightly s shaped tube and lined by hairy skin with numerous modified sweat glands which secrete ear wax the auditory canal extends to the tympanic membrane which is located in between the middle and the outer wear middle ear tympanic cavity is an airfilled cavity within the temporal bone it is lined with simple epithelium in the medial wall of the middle ear there are two openings called oval window and round window oval window is covered by a small bone called stapes the round window is covered by a fine fibrous tissue three very small bones ear ossicles called malleus incus and stapes extend across the middle ear from tympanic membrane to the oval window they form movable joints with each other and the medial wall of the cavity at the oval window malleus 1s in contact with the tympanic membrane and form a movable joint with the incus incus articulates with the stapes which fit with the oval window a long tube called eustachian tube connects the middle ear to the pharynx inner ear is formed from a network of channels and cavities in temporal bone which are called bony labyrinth within the bony labyrinth a network of fluid filled membranes called membranous labyrinth is present which lines and fills the bony labyrinth the inner ear is composed of three main regions vestibule three semicircular canals and cochlea vestibule is the expanded part near the middle ear oval and round windows are present in its lateral walls the vestibular contains two membranous sacs called utricle and saccule semicircular canals are three tubes arranged at right angles to one another so that one is situated in each of the three planes of space they are continuous with the vestibule cochlea is a coiled structure with a broad base which is continuous with the vestibule cochlea has three compartments an upper vestibular canal a lower tympanic canal and middle cochlear duct which is a small canal that separates the upper and lower canals vestibular canal originates at the oval window and the tympanic canal ends at the round window the two canals are continuous with each other and filled with perilymph the cochlear duct is a part of the membranous labyrinth and filled with endolymph the floor of the cochlear duct is called the basilar membrane which bears the organ of corti spiral organ it contains supporting cells and specialized cochlear hair cells containing mechanoreceptors auditory receptors of the ear hairs of the cochlear hair cells project into the cochlear duct many hairs are in contact with the tectorial membrane that hangs over the organ of corti hair cells synapse with the dendrites of sensory neurons that combine to form the auditory nerve which transmits auditory information to the brain functions of the human ear hearing vibrating objects produce pressure waves in the surrounding air in hearing the ear transduces these pressure waves mechanical stimulus to changing membrane potential leading to generation of nerve impulses that are transmitted to the brain which perceives as sound the outer wear collects and concentrates the sound waves and directs them along the auditory canal towards the tympanic membrane this causes the tympanic membrane to vibrate tympanic membrane vibrations are transmitted and amplified through the middle ear by the movement of three jointed ear ossicles the ear ossicles transmit the vibrations to the oval window which is located on the membrane of the cochlear surface when the stapes vibrates against the oval window pressure waves are created in the perilymph inside the cochlea most fluid pressure waves in the vestibular canal are transmitted to the endolymph of cochlea duct which push down the basilar membrane as a result the basilar membrane and attached hair cells vibrate up and down this causes bending of hair projecting from the hair cell against the fixed tectorial membrane which lies above the hair cells this results in the stimulation of auditory receptors in the auditory hair cells which lead to generation of nerve impulses these nerve impulses are passed through the auditory nerve to the auditory area of the brain temporal lobe of the cerebrum for sound perception after the sound perception the fluid wave is finally dissipated into the middle ear by vibration of the membrane of the round window the eustachian tube maintains the air pressure on both sides of tympanic membrane at the atmospheric pressure level equilibrium semicircular canals and vestibule located in the inner ear provide information about the position of the head in space and contribute to maintain the posture and balance utricle and saccule of the vestibule perceive position with respect to gravity or linear movements each of these endolymph filled chambers contain hair cells that project into a gelatinous material in which small calcium carbonate particles otolith are embedded when the head is tilted otoliths press on the hairs projecting into the gels bending the hair bundle these deflections in the hair cells cause membrane potential changes which are transmitted as nerve impulses into the cerebellum the semicircular canals arranged in three spatial planes detect angular movements of the head within each canal hair cells form a cluster with the hairs projecting into a gelatinous cap changes in the position of the head causes movements in the perilymph and endolymph as a result hair cells are stimulated and resulting nerve impulses are transmitted to the brain,the human ear consists of three main parts the outer ear middle ear and inner ear each with distinct structures and functions outer ear includes the pinna and auditory canal which directs sound waves to the tympanic membrane middle ear an airfilled cavity containing the ossicles malleus incus stapes that amplify sound vibrations and transmit them to the oval window inner ear comprises the bony labyrinth semicircular canals vestibule cochlea and membranous labyrinth the cochlea contains the organ of corti where hair cells convert sound vibrations into nerve impulses transmitted to the brain via the auditory nerve functions hearing transduction of pressure waves into nerve impulses for sound perception equilibrium semicircular canals and vestibule maintain balance and posture through hair cell stimulation in response to head movements
in the human body skin is the largest organ it consists of two main layers which are the epidermis and the dermis the layer underneath the skin is called subcutaneous layer which is composed of adipose tissue and areolar tissue epidermis epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin which consists of stratified keratinized squamous epithelium epidermis is not supplied with blood vessels but its deeper layers are provided with nutrients and oxygen by the interstitial fluid of the dermis finally drained away as lymph there are several layers of cells in the epidermis the deepest layer is the germinative layer from which epidermal cells are originated constantly these cells undergo gradual changes as they progress towards the surface of the skin the cells on the surface are flat thin nonnucleated and dead in which the cytoplasm has been replaced by keratin which is a fibrous protein the surface cells are constantly rubbed off and replaced by the cells underneath in areas where the skin is subjected to wear and tear the epidermis is thicker eg palms and fingers of the hand sole of the foot melanocytes in the deep germinative layer secrete a dark pigment called melanin contribute to the skin color in addition the extent of oxygen saturation in the circulating blood in the dermis excessive levels of bile pigments and carotenes in the fat layer can affect the skin color dermis dermis is composed of areolar connective tissue the matrix contains collagen fibers interlaced with elastic fibers collagen fibers bind water and give the skin its tensile strength fibroblasts macrophages and mast cells are the main cells found in the dermis the structures present in dermis are blood and lymph vessels sensory nerve endings sweat glands sebaceous glands hair arrector pili muscles sensory receptors meissners corpuscle pacinian corpuscle free nerve endings bulb of krause organ of ruffini merkle discs functions of the human skin protection skin acts as a defensive barrier against invasion by microorganisms entrance of chemicals and physical agents and dehydration the skin contains keratinized epithelium which is relatively waterproof this layer can protect deeper and more delicate structures the skin contains specialized immune cells which can phagocytose foreign invasions the melanin pigments protect against the harmful effects of uv radiation regulation of the body temperature the skin contributes to regulation body temperature as it provides passage through which heat can be lost or gained depending on the body requirements when body temperature is increased above the normal range sweat glands secrete sweat onto the skin surface evaporation of sweat cools the body surface when heat stressed heat loss can be promoted by increasing the blood flow through the skin capillaries by dilating arterioles when the body temperature falls beyond the normal range heat loss through the skin capillaries can be minimized by constricting arterioles in the dermis when cold stressed contraction of erector pili muscles attached to the hair can generate body heat and contribute to the heat production cutaneous sensation skin contains sensory receptors which are sensitive to touch pressure temperature and pain upon stimulation nerve impulses are generated which are transmitted to the brain for sensory perception synthesis of vitamin d exposure to sunlight can convert lipidbased substances in the skin to vitamin d excretion skin serves as a minor excretory organ sodium chloride urea and aromatic substances such as garlic can be excreted in sweat,the skin is the largest organ of the human body comprising three layers the epidermis dermis and subcutaneous layer epidermis the outermost layer made of stratified keratinized squamous epithelium lacking blood vessels it contains the germinative layer where new cells originate and melanocytes which produce melanin for skin color surface cells are keratinized flat and dead dermis composed of areolar connective tissue containing collagen and elastic fibers which provide strength and elasticity it houses various structures including blood vessels nerve endings sweat and sebaceous glands and hair follicles functions protection acts as a barrier against pathogens and chemicals melanin protects from uv radiation temperature regulation regulates body heat through sweat secretion and blood flow adjustments sensory perception contains receptors for touch pressure temperature and pain vitamin d synthesis converts substances in the skin to vitamin d upon sunlight exposure excretion minor role in excreting substances like sodium chloride and urea through sweat
endocrine system is one of the two basic systems for coordination and regulation of activities in the human body compared to the nervous system endocrine control is mainly involved in slower but more precise adjustments in maintaining homeostasis in the body the endocrine system functions through chemical signaling by hormones which are secreted by specific endocrine glands or endocrine cells endocrine glands are ductless glands consisting of groups of specialized cells which secrete hormones chemical messengers that diffuse directly into the bloodstream and reach the specific target organstissues that may be located quite distantly diffusion of hormones from these endocrine glands to the bloodstream is facilitated by the extensive capillary networks surrounding the glands hormone is a specific type of signaling molecule secreted by an endocrine glandendocrine cells which travels in the blood and acts on specific target cells elsewhere in the body changing the target cell functioning although a specific hormone can reach all body cells only the cells target cells which have matching receptors for that hormone are responsive to the chemical signal when the hormone binds to the specific receptor of the target cell it acts as a switch influencing chemicalmetabolic reactions within the cell through chemical signals hormones can communicate regulatory messages throughout the body human endocrine system mainly consists of specific endocrine glands that are widely separated from each other endocrine glands of the human endocrine system include hypothalamus pituitary gland thyroid gland parathyroid glands adrenal glands islets of langerhans in the pancreas gonads thymus gland and pineal gland in addition to these endocrine glands isolated endocrine cells are found in some organs and tissues eg stomach small intestine kidneys etc which secrete specific hormones eg isolated endocrine cells in the stomach secrete the hormone gastrin hypothalamus hypothalamus is located at the base of the fore brain just below the thalamus and connected to the pituitary gland seven hormones that are produced and released by the hypothalamus five releasing hormones and two releasing inhibiting hormones act on the anterior pituitary target site these hypothalamic hormones regulate the secretion of anterior pituitary hormones table 53 two other hormones produced by the hypothalamus oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone are stored in the posterior pituitary until they are released into the bloodstream and act on specific target sites the hypothalamus regulates the anterior pituitary gland by releasing specific hormones that control various physiological functions these hypothalamic hormones include growth hormone releasing hormone ghrh stimulates the secretion of growth hormone gh from the anterior pituitary promoting growth and metabolism thyrotropin releasing hormone trh triggers the anterior pituitary to release thyroid stimulating hormone tsh which influences thyroid function corticotropin releasing hormone crh stimulates the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone acth regulating the adrenal glands gonadotropin releasing hormone gnrh promotes the secretion of folliclestimulating hormone fsh and luteinizing hormone lh important for reproductive functions prolactin releasing hormone prh encourages the anterior pituitary to secrete prolactin which affects lactation and reproductive functions prolactin inhibiting hormone pih inhibits the secretion of prolactin to regulate its levels in the body growth hormone release inhibiting hormone ghrih suppresses the secretion of both growth hormone gh and thyroidstimulating hormone tsh growth hormone gh has both tropic and nontropic effects targeting both endocrine and nonendocrine cells it is the most abundant hormone produced by the anterior pituitary,the endocrine system is a coordination system in the human body that uses hormones as chemical messengers to maintain homeostasis unlike the nervous system it works more slowly but provides precise control through endocrine glands which are ductless glands releasing hormones directly into the bloodstream key components of the endocrine system include the hypothalamus pituitary gland thyroid gland adrenal glands gonads and others the hypothalamus plays a crucial role by releasing hormones that regulate the anterior pituitary it produces ghrh growth hormone releasing hormone stimulates growth hormone secretion trh thyrotropin releasing hormone triggers thyroidstimulating hormone release crh corticotropin releasing hormone regulates adrenal hormones gnrh gonadotropin releasing hormone influences reproductive functions prh prolactin releasing hormone stimulates prolactin for lactation pih prolactin inhibiting hormone inhibits prolactin secretion ghrih growth hormone release inhibiting hormone suppresses growth hormone secretion
pituitary gland pituitary gland is situated in the fore brain just below the hypothalamus to which it is attached by a stalk the pituitary gland consists of two main parts anterior pituitary and posterior pituitary which are actually two fused glands that perform different functions the anterior pituitary synthesizes specific hormones table 54 the anterior pituitary connects with the hypothalamus through portal blood vessels in response to the specific releasing hormones secreted from the hypothalamus table 53 anterior pituitary secretes its specific hormones to the blood stream some hormones secreted by the anterior pituitary redirect the chemical signals from hypothalamus to other endocrine glands these anterior pituitary hormones are called tropic hormones tsh acth fsh and lh as their specific target site is another endocrine gland or endocrine cell the hormone prolactin which is secreted by the anterior pituitary is not a tropic hormone as its target sites are nonendocrine tissues prolactin promotes only nontropic effects growth hormone gh secreted by the anterior pituitary has a tropic as well as nontropic effects as its target sites can be endocrine cells as well as nonendocrine cells gh is the most abundant hormone synthesized by the anterior pituitary hormones play critical roles in regulating various physiological processes by targeting specific organs or tissues the following are key hormones their target sites and their functions growth hormone gh targets all body cells particularly bones and muscles it promotes tissue growth by stimulating protein synthesis and regulates metabolism thyroid stimulating hormone tsh targets the thyroid gland it stimulates the secretion of thyroid hormones triiodothyronine and thyroxin and supports the growth of the thyroid gland prolactin targets the mammary glands it stimulates milk production and in conjunction with other hormones promotes milk secretion by the mammary glands adrenocorticotropic hormone acth targets the adrenal cortex it stimulates the secretion of glucocorticoid hormones from the adrenal cortex which are involved in stress responses and metabolic processes follicle stimulating hormone fsh in females it targets the ovaries promoting the growth and development of ovarian follicles in males it targets the testes to stimulate spermatogenesis luteinizing hormone lh in females it targets the ovaries triggering ovulation and promoting the formation of the corpus luteum which secretes progesterone in males lh targets the testes stimulating the secretion of testosterone the posterior pituitary which is an extension of the hypothalamus connecting via axons does not synthesize hormones but secretes two hypothalamic hormones oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone to the bloodstream oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone adh synthesized in the hypothalamic neurons travel through the long hypothalamic axons that reach into the posterior pituitary these hormones are stored in the axon ends located in the posterior pituitary until they are released into the blood stream in response to nerve impulses transmitted from the hypothalamus the hormones antidiuretic hormone adh and oxytocin play important roles in regulating bodily functions antidiuretic hormone adh targets the distal convoluted tubules of the nephrons and collecting ducts in the kidneys it stimulates the reabsorption of water by increasing the permeability of these tubules and ducts to water which helps maintain water balance in the body oxytocin targets the mammary glands and uterine muscles in the mammary glands it stimulates milk ejection by causing the contraction of smooth muscles in the uterus oxytocin promotes parturition childbirth by triggering the contraction of uterine smooth muscles temperature constriction of blood vessels in the skin which divert the blood from the skin to deeper tissues thereby reducing heat loss through the skin surface shivering rapid repetitive contractions of skeletal muscles to generate heat contracting hair erector muscles to generate heat to some extent stimulating secretions of more thyroid hormones eg thyroxin and adrenalin into the blood which increase the metabolic rate and cellular metabolism especially oxidation of fat in the liver to produce more heat when body temperature returns to the normal range the cold temperature sensitive receptors are no longer stimulated and their signals to the hypothalamic thermostat stop due to negative feedback mechanism then additional heat generating mechanisms in the body stop and blood flow to the peripheries returns normal homeostatic regulation of blood glucose level in human in humans normal blood glucose level is 70 110 mg100 ml while fasting which is sufficient for immediate needs of the body cells the blood glucose levels can fluctuate throughout the day within physiological limits in nondiabetic persons in the human body blood sugar levels are homeostatic ally controlled by opposing actions of two hormones secreted by the pancreas insulin and glucagon high blood glucose levels exceeding the normal limits stimulate the secretion of insulin hormone from beta cells of the islets of langerhans into the circulating blood insulin acts on specific target tissues to promote lowering of the blood glucose level insulin in the circulating blood stimulates transport of glucose into the body cells and use of glucose by body cells for atp production glucose may be broken down into carbon dioxide and water conversion of glucose to glycogen in liver and skeletal muscle cells for storage and conversion of glucose to fatty acids and storage of fat in adipose tissues when glucose level in the blood reaches normal range blood glucose level can in turn directly control the secretion of insulin levels from the pancreas through negative feedback this mechanism prevents further lowering of the glucose level in the blood beyond the normal limits low blood glucose levels below the normal limit stimulate the secretion of glucagon from alpha cells of the islets of langerhans into the circulating blood glucagon acts on specific target tissues to promote increase of the blood glucose level glucagon promotes the breakdown of glycogen in the liver and skeletal muscles and release of glucose into blood when glucose level in the blood reaches normal range blood glucose level can in turn directly control the secretion of glucagon levels from the pancreas through negative feedback which prevents further increasing of the glucose level in the blood beyond the normal limits osmoregulation when there is osmotic balance amount of water and concentration of solutes is same inside and outside the cells osmoregulation is important for organisms to keep a constant optimal osmotic pressure within the body in the humans osmoregulation ensures that the total blood volume and the concentration of dissolved substances in the plasma and tissue fluids remain constant within a favorable range in the human body osmotic balance is achieved by two ways controlling the amount of water and controlling the amount of solutes gained and lost by the body blood water homeostasis is controlled by the hypothalamus refer 541 grade 12 resource book hypothalamus contains osmoreceptors which can detect the osmolarity of the blood passing through the brain in response to the osmolarity or osmotic pressure of the blood the hypothalamus controls the sensation of thirst and secretion of the hormone adh from the posterior pituitary when blood osmolarity is increased beyond the physiological limits it is sensed by the osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus which stimulates the posterior pituitary to release adh to the blood circulation adh acts on the kidney tubules and stimulates the reabsorption of water through distal convoluted tubules of the nephrons and collecting ducts producing concentrated urine when blood osmolarity is decreased adh is not secreted so water reabsorption through distal convoluted tubules of the nephrons and collecting ducts stop thereby producing diluted urine in addition low blood volume and low blood sodium ions stimulate the kidneys to produce angiotensin ii which stimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete aldosterone hormone refer 542 grade 12 resource book aldosterone stimulates the reabsorption of sodium ions by the kidney tubules which is accompanied by the water retention thereby increasing blood volume and blood pressure hence kidneys play a major role in osmoregulation in the human body role of the liver in homeostasis liver is an active organ and plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis of the human body the functions of the liver include the following carbohydrate metabolism the liver plays an important role in maintaining blood glucose levels within normal ranges when blood glucose is increased eg after a meal glucose is stored as glycogen under the stimulation of insulin if blood glucose level is reduced eg starvation glycogen is converted back to glucose under the influence of glucagon hormone fat metabolism when the body needs excess energy fats that are stored in the liver cells are metabolized to produce atp protein metabolism in the liver cells nitrogen part of some amino acids that are not needed for new protein synthesis are removed deamination and excreted in urine or transferred to carbohydrates to synthesize new nonessential amino acids transamination liver also synthesizes plasma proteins eg albumin globulins from amino acids breakdown of erythrocytes and defense against microbial infections in humans liver is a site for red blood cell breakdown macrophages located in the liver are involved in microbial defense detoxification of drugs and toxicants the liver plays an important role in detoxification production of heat liver is the major heat producing organ of the body as it has a high metabolic rate storage of nutrients glycogen fat soluble vitamins a d e k some water soluble vitamins b12 and essential minerals such as iron copper are stored in liver inactivation of hormones some hormones are inactivated by the liver after their biological action secretion of bile liver cells synthesize the components present in the bile which is important in fat digestion and excretion of bilirubin a breakdown product of red blood cells,the pituitary gland is a vital endocrine organ located below the hypothalamus composed of the anterior and posterior pituitary the anterior pituitary produces hormones such as growth hormone gh thyroid stimulating hormone tsh prolactin adrenocorticotropic hormone acth follicle stimulating hormone fsh and luteinizing hormone lh which regulate various physiological processes in contrast the posterior pituitary stores and releases oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone adh synthesized in the hypothalamus homeostasis is maintained through feedback mechanisms involving insulin and glucagon from the pancreas regulating blood glucose levels osmoregulation ensures water balance via adh while the liver plays a crucial role in metabolic processes including carbohydrate fat and protein metabolism detoxification and nutrient storage
modes of reproduction seen among animals reproduction is a biological process through which a new generation of individuals is produced form the existing organisms two modes of reproduction are found among the animals asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction for most animals reproduction is mainly or entirely sexual several forms of asexual reproduction are also seen especially among invertebrates asexual reproduction asexual reproduction is a mechanism through which new individuals are generated from a single parent without the fusion of egg and sperm asexual reproduction relies entirely on mitotic cell division asexual reproduction allows the rapid multiplication of individuals from single parents hence no time or energy is spent in searching the mates for reproduction the produced offspring are genetically identical to each other and to the single parent several methods of asexual reproduction are found among invertebrates they include budding fragmentation and regeneration and parthenogenesis budding budding is a form of asexual reproduction in which new individuals arise form outgrowths of the animal eg vdra a localized mass of mitotically dividing cells develops into a small hydra which can eventually detach from the parent fragmentation and regeneration this is a form of asexual reproduction which involves breaking of the body or part of the body into several pieces followed by the growth of a separate individual from each piece each fragment develops into a complete animal by regrowth of lost body parts regeneration eg certain annelid worms numerous sponges cnidarians parthenogenesis this is an unusual form of asexual reproduction in which an egg develops into a complete individual without being fertilized among invertebrates parthenogenesis occurs in some animals such as bees ants aphids and wasps the progeny can be haploid or diploid in honeybees males drones are fertile haploid adults that develop through parthenogenesis whereas females including both sterile workers and the fertile queen are diploid adults that developed from fertilized eggs parthenogenesis has also been observed very rarely among vertebrates eg some lizards and fish sexual reproduction sexual reproduction isa mechanism through which a new individual is developed from a diploid zygoteasa result of the fusion of two haploid gametes the sperm and the eggwhichareproduced by two individuals the male and the female parents respectively the female gamete the egg is large and nonmotile while the male gamete the sperm is generally much smaller and motile the fusion of the female and male gametes forms a diploid cell called the zygote the animal that develops mitotically from a zygote can in turn give rise to gametes by meiosis for the most animals reproduction is mainly or entirely sexual gamete formation in animals reproductive cells called gametes sperms and eggs are the vehicles that transmit genes from one generation to the next each gamete is a haploid unicellular reproductive cell gametes in animals are formed by meiosis in special organs called gonads bisexual organism and unisexual organism ina bisexual organism hermaphrodite one individual has both female and male reproductive structures and therefore is able to produce both male and female gametes by the same individual eg earthworms in unisexual organisms dioecious one individual bear either male or female reproductive structures therefore production of male or female gametes occurs in separate organisms eg humans fertilization union of egg and sperm gametes for fusion of their nuclei to produce a zygote is called fertilization fertilization can be either external or internal externalfertilizationoccursinaquaticenvironmentsinspecieswithexternalfertilization the female releases eggs while the male releases sperm into the external environment and fertilization occurs in the water a moist habitat is almost always required for external fertilization both to prevent the gametes from drying out and to allow the sperm to swim toward the egg eg many invertebrates amphibians most bony fish in internal fertilization sperms are deposited in or near the female reproductive tract and fertilization occurs within the female reproductive tract eg insects reptiles mammals internal fertilization is an adaptation that enables sperm to reach an egg even when the environment is dry the male copulatory organ delivers sperm and the female reproductive tract often has receptacles for storage and delivery of sperm to mature eggs internal fertilization is typically associated with the production of fewer gametes than external fertilization but results in the survival of a higher fraction of zygotes internal fertilization often provides greater protection to the embryos many animals show parental care internally fertilized eggs of birds and other reptiles possess shells and internal membranes that protect against water loss and physical damage some retain the embryo for a portion of any development within the female reproductive tract significance of asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction are important biological processes to ensure existence of a species asexual reproduction allows rapid multiplication of individuals from single parents hence no time or energy is needed to be spent in searching mates for reproduction in asexual reproduction there is no or very little genetic variation within a population as the produced offspring are genetically identical to each other and to the single parent therefore asexual reproduction would be more advantageous in stable favorable environments as it can propagate successful genotypes specifically however any mutation in the parent cell can cause harmful effects on the survival ability of the offspring in changing environments if there is a harmful mutation in the organisms environment changes could be deadly to all the individuals in the population unlike asexual reproduction sexual reproduction results in the production of a unique offspring by combining genetic materials from two parents meiotic recombination during sexual reproduction helps produce varied genotypes unique gene combinations formed during sexual reproduction would be advantageous as this can enhance reproductive success and survival of a species in changing environments beneficial gene combination arising through recombination may speed up adaptation during sexual reproduction shuffling of genes might allow a population to clear sets of harmful genes more readily which would enhance the survival of the species,reproduction in animals occurs through two primary modes asexual and sexual reproduction asexual reproduction involves a single parent producing offspring without the fusion of gametes resulting in genetically identical offspring key methods include budding new individuals grow from outgrowths eg hydra fragmentation and regeneration body parts break off and develop into new individuals eg annelid worms parthenogenesis eggs develop into individuals without fertilization eg bees sexual reproduction involves the fusion of haploid gametes sperm and egg from two parents to form a diploid zygote key concepts include gamete formation gametes are produced via meiosis in gonads fertilization can be external in water or internal within the female biodiversity sexual reproduction promotes genetic variation aiding adaptation in changing environments both reproduction modes ensure species survival with asexual reproduction favoring rapid population growth and sexual reproduction enhancing genetic diversity
main internal reproductive structures of a male consist of gonads testes which produce sperm and reproductive hormones epididymis which store mature sperms accessory glands that secrete products required for sperm movement and ducts that transport the mature sperm and glandular secretions the external reproductive organs of a male are the scrotum and penis scrotum scrotum is a pouch formed by a fold of the body wall scrotum is divided into two compartments each compartment contains one testis one epididymis and part of the spermatic cords which suspend the testis in the scrotum tests the tests are found within the scrotum which allows the maintenance of the testis temperature 2c below the core body temperature sperms are produced properly only when the testes are cooler than the rest of the body the testes develop in the abdominal cavity and descend into the scrotum just before birth the testes are cooled by their position outside the abdominal cavity and the thin covering of the scrotum each testis contains many lobules within each lobule there are highly coiled convoluted loops called seminiferous tubules sperms are produced within these tubules different cells that undergo spermatogenesis are surrounded and connected to special types of supporting cells sertoli cells located in the seminiferous tubule sertoli cells extend from the wall of the seminiferous tubules to the lumen these cells secrete the hormone inhibin and nourish and provide attachment for cells that are in different stages of spermatogenesis groups of cells called leydig cells or interstitial cells are present in the connective tissue between the seminiferous tubules leydig cells secrete the hormone testosterone and other androgens after puberty which promote spermatogenesis in the tubules the seminiferous tubules combine to form a single tubule duct at the upper part of the testes epididymis epididymis is the tightly packed mass that is formed by the repeatedly folded long duct originating from combined seminiferous tubules in the testis from the seminiferous tubules the sperm passes into the epididymis since it is very long about 6 m in length it takes about 3 weeks for sperm to travel the length of this duct during this time the sperms become matured and motile matured sperms are stored within the epididymis until ejaculation vas deference ejaculatory duct urethra and penis during ejaculation sperm are propelled form each epididymis through a muscular duct the vas deferens each vas deferens one from each epididymis extends round and behind the urinary bladder where it joins a duct from a seminal vesicle forming a short ejaculatory duct the ejaculatory duets open into the urethra which is the passageway for both urinary excretion and delivery of sperms in semen into the female reproductive tract the urethra runs through the penis and opens toth outside at the tip of the peni which contains erectile tissues derived from modified veins and capillaries spermatogenesis spermatogenesisistheprocessofmalegameteformationwhichincludesformationofspermatocytes from spermatogonium meiotic division of the spermatocytes and transformation of the four resulting spermatids from each sperm a to cite into sperm at zoa sperm spermatogenesis occurs within the seminiferous tubules of the testes the time taken to produce mature sperm cells from a specific spermatogonia in a seminiferous tubule is about seven weeks from start to finish the formation and development of sperms is continuous and inexhaustible in adult human males cell division and maturation during spermatogenesis occur throughout the seminiferous tubules hundreds of millions of sperm are produced each day by spermatogenesis in contrast to oogenesis discussed later in spermatogenesis all four cells produced during meiosis of each primary spermatocyte develop into mature sperms spermatogenesis starts a puberty and occurs throughout life spermatogenesis produces mature sperms from precursor cells in a continuous sequence main steps in spermatogenesis the stem cells 2n that give rise to sperms spermatogonia stem cells arise from mitotic division and differentiation of primordial germ cells in the embryonic testes these stem cells are situated near the edge of these viniferous tubules in mature testis their progeny moves in ward as they pass through the different stages of maturation in mature testes the stem cells divide mitotically to form spermatogonia 2n which in turn generate primary spermatocytes 2n by mitosis each primary sperm atocytegivesriseto four spermatidsnthrough meiosis two secondary spermatocytes meiosis1 and two spermatids from each secondary sperm a located in meiosis ii reducing the chromosome number from diploid2nn6inhumansto haploid n23 these spermatids differentiate into sperms with its characteristic head midpiece and tail the sperms are released into the fluidfilled lumen of the tubule and they travel along the tubule into the epididymis where they become mature and motile after puberty leydig cells are present between the seminiferous tubules to secrete the hormone testosterone which promotes spermatogenesis different cells that undergo spermatogenesis are surrounded and connected to special types of supporting cells called sertoli cells these cells extend from the wall of the seminiferous tubules to the lumen these cells secrete inhibin hormone and nourish and provide attachment for cells that are in different stages of spermatogenesis each sperm is made up of three main parts the head midpiece body and tail head of the sperm contains the haploid nucleus carrying the paternal genetic material a special vesicle called the acrosome is present at the anterior end of the head it contains hydrolytic enzymes such as trypsin and hyaluronidase that help the sperm to penetrate the outer layers of the ovum midpiece of the sperm contains many mitochondria that provides atp necessary for the movement of the tail the tail of the sperm contains a long flagellum with a typical 92 arrangement of microtubules it is produced by the centriole found near the base of the nucleus the tail enables the sperm to swim along the female reproductive tract towards an ovum semen the semen is the fluid that contains a mixture of sperms and the secretions of three sets of accessory glands the semen is discharged from the urethra during ejaculation usually a normal ejaculate contains about 25 ml of semen and the sperm count in the semen may be in the range of 40100 millionml normally the sperms comprise less than 10 of the final ejaculate main fraction of the semen is made up of secretions from seminal vesicles and the prostate gland the semen contains several components such as mucus enzymes prostaglandins ascorbic acid citrate and fructose which promote the survival of sperm the semen provides a liquid medium for the sperm movement and also helps to neutralize the acidity in the female reproductive tract the life expectancy of a sperm is about 4872 hours after ejaculation accessory glands associated with the male reproductive system there are three sets of accessory glands that produce secretions necessary for sperm survival and movement they are seminal vesicles prostate gland and bulbourethral glands seminal vesicles they are a pair of two small pouches that produce a thick yellowish fluid that is expelled during ejaculation seminal fluid is alkaline to protect the sperm in the acidic environment of the vagina it contains mucus fructose that provides most of the sperms energy a coagulating enzyme helps semen coagulates after ejaculation ascorbic acid and local regulators called prostaglandins this fluid contributes to about 60 of the volume of semen each seminal vesicle opens into a short duct that joins the corresponding vas deference to form an ejaculatory duct prostate gland this gland is found below the urinary bladder it secretes a thin milky fluid directly into the urethra through small ducts this milky secretion contains anticoagulant enzymes and citrate which is a sperm nutrient this fluid contributes to about 30 of the volume of semen bulbourethral glands they are a pair of small glands found along the urethra below the prostate these glands secrete a clear alkaline mucus that is able to neutralize any acidic urine remaining in the urethra and lubricates the lining of the urethra hormonal control of the male reproductive system in males in response to the release of gnrh from the hypothalamus just before puberty results in the release of fsh and lh by the anterior pituitary rising levels of the fsh and lh hormones at puberty promotes mature functioning of the male reproductive organs the hormones regulate the development growth pubertal maturation and reproductive processes of the body fsh and lh hormones direct spermatogenesis by acting on different types of cells in the testis fsh stimulates sertoli cells to nourish the developing sperm lh causes leydig cells to produce testosterone and other androgens to promote spermatogenesis two negativefeedback mechanisms control sex hormone production in males testosterone inhibits gnrh fsh and lh in blood through its effect on the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary further inhibin produced by sertoli cells acts on anterior pituitary gland to reduce fsh secretion these negativefeedback circuits maintain testosterone and other androgen levels in the normal range,the male reproductive system consists of internal structures like the testes epididymis accessory glands and ducts as well as external organs such as the scrotum and penis testes produce sperm and hormones remaining cooler in the scrotum 2c below body temperature spermatogenesis occurs in seminiferous tubules where spermatogonia develop into primary spermatocytes then secondary spermatocytes and finally spermatids which mature into sperm epididymis stores and matures sperm semen consisting of sperm and secretions from seminal vesicles prostate and bulbourethral glands nourishes and protects sperm hormones like fsh stimulate sertoli cells to nourish sperm while lh prompts leydig cells to produce testosterone regulating spermatogenesis negative feedback mechanisms control hormone levels to maintain balance
main internal structures of the female reproductive system consists of two ovaries female gonads two oviducts uterus and vagina ovaries the female gonads are the two ovaries they are found on either side of the uterus and are held in place in the abdominal cavity by ligaments in the ovary female gametes are stored and developed prior to ovulation ovaries also produce female sex hormones that are needed for physiological changes during the reproductive cycle the ovaries have two tissue layers outer the cortex and inner the medulla the outer layer of each ovary consists of connective tissues covered by germinal epithelium the outer layer contains ovarian follicles in various stages of maturity each follicle consists of an oocyte which is a partially developed egg surrounded by support cells support cells protect and nourish the oocyte during its development the ovum is discharged from the ovary at secondary oocyte stage of oogenesis with the first polar body this secondary oocyte divides into the mature ovum egg and a second polar body if a sperm penetrates the secondary oocyte human ovum is a round cell with 23 maternal chromosomes and relatively large cytoplasm and is surrounded by numerous supporting cells in addition there is a clear layer present between plasma membrane of the ovum and the supporting cells zona pellucida oviducts the oviduct or the fallopian tube extends from the uterus toward a funnel like opening at each ovary the dimensions of this tube vary along its length near the uterus is narrow as a human hair after ovulation cilia on the inner epithelial lining of the oviduct help collect the egg by drawing fluid from the body cavity into the oviduct then with the help of wave like contractions of the oviduct the cilia convey the egg down the oviduct to the uterus uterus the uterus or the womb is a thick pear shaped chamber its walls are muscular which allows it to expand during pregnancy to accommodate the fetus and its inner lining endometrium is highly vascularized the distal end of the uterus narrows to form a neck called the cervix that opens into the vagina vagina this is a muscular but elastic chamber with a stratified epithelium the vagina connects external and internal organs of reproduction it is the site where sperm is deposited and also serves as the birth canal oogenesis in the human female the development of mature oocytes takes a long time immature eggs are formed in the ovary of a developing female embryo but these eggs complete their development many years or even decades later in oogenesis cytokinesis during meiosis is unequal with almost all the cytoplasm segregated to a single daughter cell this large cell develops to become the egg the other products of meiosis which are smaller cells are known as polar bodies these polar bodies eventually degenerate unlike spermatogenesis the mitotic divisions that occur during oogenesis in human females are thought to be complete before birth and the production of mature gametes ceases at about the age 50 years unlike in spermatogenesis during oogenesis there are also long interruptions main steps in oogenesis oogenesis begins in the female embryo with the mitotic division of primordial germ cells that give rise to oogonia then oogonia divide by mitosis to form cells that begin meiosis but stops at prophase i before birth each of these developmentally arrested cells is called a primary oocyte each primary oocyte is found within a small follicle a cavity lined with protective cells at birth the ovaries together contain about 12 million primary oocytes out of these about 500 fully mature between the puberty and menopause beginning at puberty follicle stimulating hormone fsh periodically stimulates a small group of follicles to resume growth and development out of these only one follicle fully matures each month during this time the primary oocyte within the follicle completes meiosis i and produces a secondary oocyte and the first polar body then the meiosis ii starts but stops at the metaphase the secondary oocyte arrested in meiosis ii is released at ovulation with the first polar body when its follicle breaks open if a sperm penetrates the secondary oocyte meiosis ii completes and the secondary oocyte divides into the mature ovum and a second polar body both meiotic divisions involve unequal cytokinesis with the smaller cells becoming polar bodies which will degenerate eventually if a sperm penetrates there is a single mature egg ovum containing a sperm head at the end of oogenesis the fusion of the haploid nuclei of the sperm and the ovum is called fertilization the ruptured follicle left behind after ovulation develops into the corpus luteum corpus luteum secretes estradiol and progesterone hormones which help to maintain the uterine lining during pregnancy if the egg is not fertilized the corpus luteum degenerates and leaves a small permanent scar of fibrous tissue called corpus albicans on the ovary surface a new follicle matures during the next cycle hormonal control of the human female reproductive cycles although males produce sperms continuously females produce ova in cycles there are two linked reproductive cycles in a human female during their reproductive years the ovarian cycle and the uterine cycle or the menstrual nee cycle the uterine cycle consists of changes that occur follicle about once a month in the uterus and these cyclic changes in the uterus are controlled by the ovarian cycle which is cyclic events that occur in the ovaries both of these 4 cycles are regulated by hormonal activities which link the two cycles synchronizing ovarian follicle growth and q ovulation with the establishment of a uterine lining which supports the development of embryo 1 ovarian cycle ovarian cycle comprises follicular phase and luteal phase the period during which the follicle grows and the oocyte matures is referred to as the follicular phase at the beginning of follicular phase gnrh from the hypothalamus simulates the anterior pituitary to secrete small amounts of fsh and lh fsh stimulates follicle growth aided by lh cells of the growing follicle start to make estradiol hormone therefore the estradiol level rises slowly during the follicular phase the low levels of estradiol inhibit the secretion of gonadotropin hormones from the anterior pituitary negative feedback so that lh and fsh are kept at relatively low levels in the follicular phase when estradiol secretion by the growing follicle starts to increase sharply high levels of estradiol stimulate the hypothalamus to increase gnrh secretion which in turn stimulates the anterior pituitary to sharply rise the fsh and lh secretion especially producing a lh surge through positive feedback mechanism by this time the maturing follicle containing a fluidfilled cavity has enlarged forming a bulge at the surface of the ovary about a day after the lh surge the follicular phase ends at ovulation in response to both fsh and the peak in lh level the follicle and adjacent wall of the ovary rupture releasing the secondary oocyte which is called ovulation the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle takes place after ovulation in the luteal phase lh stimulates the follicular tissue within the ovary to transform into a glandular structure called the corpus luteum the corpus luteum secretes progesterone and estradiol which then exert negativefeedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary this feedback reduces lh and fsh secretion to very low levels and thereby prevents the maturation of another egg in the ovary if there is no pregnancy the low gonadotropin levels at the end of luteal phase promotes disintegration degeneration of the corpus luteum disintegration degeneration of corpus luteum leads to the sharp decline in production of its hormones as a result the negativefeedback of estradiol and progesterone on the hypothalamus and pituitary are removed this enables the pituitary to produce fsh to stimulate the growth of a new follicles thereby starting the next ovarian cycle 2 uterine menstrual cycle uterine cycle consists of proliferative phase secretory phase and menstrual flow phase proliferative phase before ovulation steroid hormones of the ovary stimulate the uterus to prepare for support of an embryo growing follicles secrete estradiol that stimulates the endometrium to thicken this is referred to as the proliferative phase in the uterine cycle therefore the follicular phase of the ovarian cycle coordinates with the proliferative phase of the uterine cycle the secretory phase starts after ovulation after ovulation estradiol and progesterone that are secreted from the corpus luteum stimulate the maintenance and further development of the lining of the uterus by enlarging the arteries and growth of the endometrial glands these glands secrete nutrient fluid that can sustain an early embryo if fertilization occurs hence the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle is coordinated with the secretory phase of the uterine cycle menstrual flow phase if implantation of an embryo does not occur the corpus luteum disintegrates which results in the drop in ovarian hormones this brings about the end of the secretory phase as a result arteries constrict and thereby the uterine lining disintegrates and causes the shedding of endometrial tissues and fluid this is the menstrual flow phase of the uterine cycle the cyclic shedding of the bloodrich endometrium from the uterus a process that occurs in a flow and which lasts for a few days through the cervix and vagina is called menstruation menopause this is the cessation of ovulation and menstruation in a woman usually menopause takes place between the ages of45 and 55 years during this time the ovarian supply of oocytes runs out and the estrogen production by the ovary decreases ovaries become less responsive to the hormones fsh and lh produced by the anterior pituitary,the female reproductive system consists of two ovaries two oviducts the uterus and the vagina ovaries the female gonads store and develop female gametes oocytes and produce hormones estradiol and progesterone regulating the reproductive cycle oocytes undergo oogenesis a process where primary oocytes complete meiosis to form a secondary oocyte and polar bodies with fertilization leading to a mature ovum oviducts also known as fallopian tubes they transport the ovulated egg from the ovary to the uterus uterus a muscular chamber that supports fetal development its inner lining the endometrium thickens during the proliferative phase and sheds during menstruation if no pregnancy occurs menstrual cycle comprises the ovarian cycle follicular and luteal phases and the uterine cycle proliferative secretory and menstrual phases regulated by hormones like fsh and lh menopause the end of menstruation occurring between ages 45 and 55 marked by the depletion of oocytes and decreased estrogen production
growth of a new human being starts when an ovum is fertilized by a sperm usually in the oviduct during the development of the individual within the mothers uterus a sequence of events occurs from fertilization to the birth which normally ends in 38 weeks or roughly 9 months the first 8 weeks of human development is called the embryonic period and thereafter the developing individual is called a fetus fertilizationconception and the formation of a human zygote during ovulation a secondary oocyte arrested at metaphase i enters the oviduct during fertilization a sperm enters the secondary oocyte penetrating the epithelial cells surrounding the oocyte the glycoprotein layer present between the oocytes plasma membrane and the surrounding cells once the sperm enters the secondary oocyte meiosis ii of the oocyte is completed producing the mature ovum subsequently the two haploid pronuclei of the mature ovum and the sperm fuse to produce a diploid single cell referred to as the zygote the fusion of the haploid nuclei of the sperm and the ovum is called fertilization fertilization takes place in the upper reaches of the oviduct within 12 to 24 hours after ovulation cleavage of the zygote blastocyst formation and implantation about 24 hours after fertilization a series of rapid mitotic cell divisions called cleavage take place in the zygote cleavage of zygote begins in the oviduct as it moves forward towards the uterus by ciliary and peristaltic movements cleavage continues forming a solid ball of cells morula by the time the embryo reaches the uterus about 34 days after fertilization morula floats within the uterine cavity and gets nutrition by endometrial secretions about five days after fertilization a large fluid filled cavity is formed surrounding the ball of cells with the formation of the cavity this developing stage 1s referred to as the blastocyst further rearrangements of the cells in the blastocyst results in two distinct structures the inner cell mass and the trophoblast inner cell mass is located internally and eventually develops into the embryo and the membranes enclosing the embryo which are called the amniotic sac the trophoblast which is the outer layer of cells will ultimately develops into the fetal portion of the placenta around 7 days after fertilization the blastocyst attaches to the endometrium of the mothers uterus this is called implantation as the blastocyst implants the inner cell mass orients towards the endometrium the trophoblast grows outward and invades the endometrium this is initiated by the enzyme secreted by the trophoblast to breakdown the uterine lining then the trophoblast extends finger like projections into the endometrium trophoblast begins to secrete human chorionic gonadotropin hcg hormone which has the action similar to lh the hormone hcg rescues the corpus luteum from degeneration and sustains its secretion of progesterone and estrogen which maintain the uterine lining preventing menstruation after implantation three germ layers are formed in the developing embryo at the end of the gastrulation stage extraembryonic membranes begin to appear which surround the embryo the placenta is formed by the cells of trophoblast and the adjacent endometrial tissues embryonic membranes fetal membranes four new extra embryonic membranes appear after implantation they are chorion amnion yolk sac and allantois they provide a life support system for further embryonic fetal development chorion becomes the main embryonic portion of the placenta which is the structure for exchange of materials between the fetus and mother it also protects the embryofetus from immune responses of the mother chorion produces hcg an important hormone of pregnancy amnion is a protective membrane surrounding the embryofetus creating a fluid filled cavity which serves as a shock absorber and helps prevent desiccation yolk sac contributes to the cells that will become blood cells until the fetal liver takes over it also is the source of primordial germ cells that migrate to the developing gonads allantois is a small outerpouching of the yolk sac that serves as an early site for blood formation and its associated with the development of the urinary bladder placenta and umbilical cord during the first 24 weeks of embryonic development the embryo obtains nourishment directly from the endometrium eventually the embryonic trophoblast and the mothers endometrium intermingles and form the placenta the placenta is a disc shaped organ formed by two parts embryonicfetal portion formed by chorionic villi of the chorion and maternal portion formed by the endometrium the placenta contains both embryonic fetal and maternal blood vessels however maternal and fetal blood vessels do not join and the blood they carry do not normally mix the placenta mediates the exchange of material nutrients respiratory gases metabolic wastes between the embryonicfetal and the mothers circulatory systems the placenta supplies oxygen and nutrients to the fetus from the maternal blood stream and excrete waste products from the fetus to the maternal blood stream the placenta also helps to provide immune protection to the developing embryofetus the placenta produces hormones eg hcg progesterone etc needed to sustain the pregnancy umbilical cord is a flexible cordlike structure containing blood vessels and attaches embryofetus to the placenta during gestation oxygen poor blood from the embryofetus travels to the placenta through the two arteries of the umbilical cord and passes through fingerlike projections chorionic villi of the placenta where oxygen and nutrients are acquired fetal blood oxygen rich blood leaves the placenta through the umbilical vein leading back to the embryofetus,human development begins with the fertilization of an ovum by a sperm in the oviduct forming a diploid zygote the process involves fertilization the sperm penetrates the ovum completing meiosis ii and forming a zygote within 1224 hours postovulation cleavage and blastocyst formation rapid mitotic divisions occur resulting in a morula a solid ball of cells which develops into a blastocyst about five days after fertilization the blastocyst has an inner cell mass develops into the embryo and trophoblast forms the placenta implantation the blastocyst embeds into the uterine lining around seven days postfertilization where the trophoblast secretes human chorionic gonadotropin hcg supporting the corpus luteum to maintain progesterone and estrogen levels germ layers and embryonic membranes three germ layers form and four extraembryonic membranes develop chorion amnion yolk sac allantois to support development placenta and umbilical cord the placenta formed from the trophoblast and maternal tissues facilitates nutrient and gas exchange without mixing blood the umbilical cord connects the fetus to the placenta transporting oxygenrich blood to the embryo
pregnancy or gestation is the condition of carrying one or more developing offspring inside the uterus of a female human pregnancy period is usually 38 weeks from fertilization to birth or roughly 9 months or 40 weeks from the last menstruation to birth the nine months of pregnancy are divided into three trimesters of about three months each during the first trimester the implanted embryo secretes hormones to regulate the mothers reproductive system and to indicate its presence the hcg hormone secreted by the embryo maintains the corpus luteum in the ovary to secrete progesterone and estrogen some amount of this hcg passes from the maternal blood to the urine the presence of hcg in pregnant mothers blood and urine can be easily detected and therefore is used as an early pregnancy detection test high levels of progesterone brings about rapid changes in the mother both ovulation and menstrual cycles stop the maternal side of the placenta grows and the breasts and the uterus get larger mucus in the cervix of the mother forms a plug which prevents the fetus from infections most mothers experience nausea morning sickness during the first trimester by the second trimester the level of hcg declines and as a result the corpus luteum deteriorates but the placenta takes over the production of progesterone and estrogens which helps to maintain the pregnancy mother can feel fetal movements as the fetus grows mothers abdominal organs become compressed and displaced in the third trimester of pregnancy this may lead to digestive blockage and frequent urination major fetal changes in each trimester first trimester the first trimester is the most critical stage of development during which the rudiments of all major organ systems appear this is the main period of organogenesis the development of the body organs the heart begins to beat by the 4 week can be detected at 810 weeks by the 8week embryo is said to be the fetus as all the parts of an adult are present in rudimentary form at the end of the 1 trimester the fetus is well differentiated and about 5 7 cm long second trimester by the end of second trimester the fetus assumes distinctively human features organ systems are completely developed in this stage during the second trimester the fetus grows to about 30 cm in length and is very active so that the mother may feel the fetal movements third trimester the third trimester represents a period of rapid fetal growth during the early stage of this period most of the organ systems become fully functional during the third trimester the fetus grows to about 50 cm in length and weighs about 34 kg fetal activity decrease as it fills the space within the uterus maternal immune tolerances of the embryo and fetus during pregnancy the overall regulation of the mothers immune system changes these changes allow the mother to keep the embryo in her uterus without rejecting as a foreign body even though half the embryos genes are inherited from the father and many chemical markers on the surface of the embryo are foreign to the mother process of parturition child birth begins with the labor the labor is a series of strong rhythmic uterine contractions that push the fetus and placenta out of the body when labor begins local regulators prostaglandins and hormones mainly estradiol and oxytocin induce and regulate further contractions of the uterus this is a positive feedback mechanism as uterine contractions stimulate secretion of oxytocin which stimulates further contractions of the uterus the labor can be divided into three stages the first stage is the thinning and opening up dilation of the cervix the second stage is the delivery of the baby in this stage continuous and strong contractions force the fetus out of the uterus and expel through the vagina delivery of the placenta is the final stage of labor lactation the lactation which is unique to mammals begins as post natal care lactation is the secretion and ejection of mothers milk from the mammary glands lactation is subjected to nervous and hormonal regulation the main hormone in promoting milk synthesis and secretion is prolactin in response to suckling by the new born baby which initiates nerve impulses from touch receptors in the nipples and decrease in estradiol and progesterone levels in the mothers blood after birth the hypothalamus send impulses to the anterior pituitary to secrete prolactin hormone which stimulates the mammary glands to produce milk suckling also stimulates the secretion of oxytocin hormone from the posterior pituitary gland and triggers the release ejection of milk from the mammary glands this is a positive feedback mechanism as milk availability encourages continuous suckling so touch sensation on the nipple and oxytocin release continue further ejecting milk from the mammary glands composition of human milk and significance of breast feeding during the first few days after birth the mammary glands secrete a fluid called colostrum until appearance of true milk human milk is a sterile solution that contain nutrients such as lactose fatty acids amino acids minerals vitamins and water that are ideal for babys digestion brain development and growth human milk includes proteins such as casein lactalbumin and immunoglobulins colostrum and true milk provide nutrients for the baby and contain important antibodies that protect the infant several types of white blood cells are also present in the breast milk which help the baby to resist microbial infections compared to the true milk colostrum contains less nutrients less lactose and no fat but they are adequate for the early nutritional needs breast feeding supports optimal infant growth enhances intellectual development and fosters motherinfant relations by establishing early and prolonged contact between them compared to cows milk the fat iron and the proteins in the breast milk are more readily metabolized lower sodium content of breast milk is more suited to the babys needs the baby is less likely to have allergic reactions to mothers milk than the milk from another source,pregnancy or gestation is the period during which one or more developing offspring grow in a females uterus lasting about 38 weeks it is divided into three trimesters first trimester critical for organogenesis the heart beats by week 4 and by week 8 the embryo is termed a fetus second trimester organ systems mature the fetus grows to approximately 30 cm and movements are felt by the mother third trimester rapid growth occurs the fetus reaches about 50 cm and weighs 34 kg with reduced activity as space decreases during pregnancy the maternal immune system adapts to tolerate the embryo childbirth or parturition involves labor a series of uterine contractions lactation the secretion of milk begins postbirth regulated by hormones like prolactin and oxytocin human milk provides essential nutrients and antibodies fostering infant growth and immunity

sensation on the nipple and oxytocin release continue further ejecting milk from the mammary glands composition of human milk and significance of breast feeding during the first few days after birth the mammary glands secrete a fluid called colostrum until appearance of true milk human milk is a sterile solution that contain nutrients such as lactose fatty acids amino acids minerals vitamins and water that are ideal for babys digestion brain development and growth human milk includes proteins such as casein lactalbumin and immunoglobulins colostrum and true milk provide nutrients for the baby and contain important antibodies that protect the infant several types of white blood cells are also present in the breast milk which help the baby to resist microbial infections compared to the true milk colostrum contains less nutrients less lactose and no fat but they are adequate for the early nutritional needs breast feeding supports optimal infant growth enhances intellectual development and fosters motherinfant relations by establishing early and prolonged contact between them compared to cows milk the fat iron and the proteins in the breast milk are more readily metabolized lower sodium content of breast milk is more suited to the babys needs the baby is less likely to have allergic reactions to mothers milk than the milk from another source,pregnancy or gestation is the period during which one or more offspring develop inside a females uterus lasting about 38 weeks from fertilization it is divided into three trimesters first trimester organogenesis occurs with the heart starting to beat by the 4th week the embryo releases hcg regulating the mothers hormones preventing ovulation and menstruation nausea is common second trimester the placenta takes over hormone production as hcg levels decline the fetus grows to about 30 cm and exhibits distinct human features third trimester rapid growth continues reaching about 50 cm and 34 kg fetal movement decreases as space becomes limited immune tolerance the mothers immune system adjusts to prevent rejection of the embryo which has paternal genes parturition labor consists of contractions to expel the fetus and placenta regulated by hormones like oxytocin lactation after birth prolactin promotes milk production while oxytocin aids in milk ejection human milk contains essential nutrients and antibodies supporting infant growth and immunity
the structure and functions of the skeletal systems of animals in the animal kingdom three major types of skeletons are found they are hydrostatic skeletons exoskeletons and endoskeletons hydrostatic skeleton is a fluid filled body cavity which is enclosed by the body wall in cnidarians gastrovascular cavity acts as the hydrostatic skeleton in some animals such as nematodes and annelids the fluid filled cavity enclosed by the body wall eg pseudocoelom in nematoda coelom in annelida consists of two muscle layers longitudinal and circular muscles which act antagonistically the combined effect of muscle contraction and fluid pressure aids in locomotion and maintain the shape and form of the animal in many animals the spaces between cells are filled with fluid called interstitial fluid which provides support to these cells exoskeleton its a rigid outer covering of the body of the animal which acts as a skeleton different types of exoskeletons are seen in the animal kingdom chitinous exoskeleton calcium carbonate exoskeleton and bony plates arthropods possess the exoskeleton which is mainly composed of a noncellular material chitin the chitinous exoskeleton is hardened by proteins or calcium carbonate exoskeletons that are made up of calcium carbonate are seen in the mollusks in some reptiles bony plates serve as the exoskeleton endoskeleton 1s a hard skeleton which is buried in the soft tissues of the animal different types of endoskeletons are seen in the animal kingdom these include plates of calcium carbonate in echinodermates bones and cartilage in chordates common functions of the skeletal systems in animals support all skeletons provide a rigid framework for the body and are resistant to compression and tension forces they help to maintain the shape of body protection the skeleton protects the delicate internal organs movement most skeletons are composed of rigid materials which provide surface by means of attachment for the muscles of the body parts of the skeleton operate as levers on which the muscles can pull when this occurs movement takes place functions of the human skeletal systems support protection movement the human skeleton human skeleton is divided into two main parts axial skeleton and appendicular skeleton axial skeleton consists of skull vertebral column sternum and ribs appendicular skeleton consists of girdles pectoral and pelvic and limb bones,animal skeletons can be classified into three main types hydrostatic skeleton a fluidfilled cavity eg gastrovascular cavity in cnidarians that provides support and aids locomotion through muscle contractions and fluid pressure in nematodes and annelids the fluidfilled coelom is surrounded by two muscle layers longitudinal and circular exoskeleton a rigid outer covering made from materials like chitin in arthropods calcium carbonate in mollusks or bony plates in some reptiles it provides support protection and facilitates movement by serving as a muscle attachment site endoskeleton a hard internal skeleton composed of bones and cartilage in chordates or calcium carbonate plates in echinoderms offering structural support and protection for internal organs functions of the skeletal system support provides a rigid framework for maintaining body shape protection shields delicate internal organs movement acts as levers for muscle attachment enabling motion the human skeleton is divided into two parts the axial skeleton skull vertebral column sternum and ribs and the appendicular skeleton pectoral and pelvic girdles limb bones
skull in humans the skull rests on the upper end of the vertebral column the human skull consists of 22 bones which are mostly connected together by ossified joints sutures skull is divided into the cranium brain case and the face the bones in the cranium are the frontal bone two parietal bones the occipital bone two temporal bones the ethmoid bone and the sphenoid bone in addition to the frontal bone fourteen other bones form the skeleton of the face they are two zygomatic bones cheek bonesfused two maxillae united to form the upper jaw bone two nasal bones two lacrimal bones the vomer two palatine bones two inferior conchae and the mandible lower jaw bone cranium region human cranial capacity is nearly 15 l cranium protects and encloses the brain it also protects the inner ear middle ear olfactory organs and eyes bony eye sockets provide attachment to the eye muscles that move them on the inferior surface of the cranium there is foramen magnum to provide passage to spinal cord two smooth rounded knobs occipital condyles on either side of the foramen magnum articulates with the first vertebrae atlas vertebrae which permits nodding movements in the cranium soft membranous regions called fontanelles are present which allow slight compressions at birth facilitating parturition fontanelles become replaced by bones within 12 years of life immovable joints sutures are present between the skull bones to provide more protection several air filled cavities lined by ciliated mucous membrane are present in the skull in the sphenoid ethmoid maxillary and frontal bones they are called sinuses they all communicate with the nasal cavity sinuses provide resonance to voice and reduce the weight of the skull facial region facial region is situated below the cranium some facial bones form the walls of the posterior part of the nasal cavity and form the upper part of the air passages maxilla and mandible provide ridges in which teeth are embedded upper jaw maxilla is fused with cranium lower jaw mandible is movable hard palate bony and soft palate cartilaginous separate the buccal cavity from nasal cavity lower jaw articulates with the cranium zygomatic arch formed from parts of zygomatic bone and temporal bone provides the surface for muscular attachment for moving the lower jaw lower jaw mandible contains two processes condyloid process which articulates with the temporal bone to form the temporalmandibular joint coronoid process which gives attachment to muscles and the ligaments at the base of the skull occipital condyles 1 pair are present on occipital bone to form a hinge joint with atlas vertebrae temporal bone contains three processes zygomatic process which forms part of the zygomatic arch mastoid process and styloid process they provide surfaces for muscle attachment vertebral column vertebral column is a strong flexible rod consisting of 26 linearly arranged bones it consists of 24 separate vertebrae extending downwards from the occipital bone of the skull the sacrum formed from 5 fused vertebrae and coccyx formed from 4 small fused vertebrae the vertebral column is divided into different regions there are 4 distinct regions cervical spine formed by 7 vertebrae in the neck thoracic spine formed by next 12 vertebrae lumbar spine formed by next 5 vertebrae and the sacrum to which the lowest vertebrae of lumbar spine is articulated the coccyx is situated at the end curvatures of the vertebral column in humans there are four curves in the vertebral column cervical thoracic lumbar and sacral they can be categorized into two main types two primary curvatures and two secondary curvatures main function of the curvatures is the maintenance of the erect posture primary curvatures in the fetus there is only one curvature in the vertebral column when secondary curvatures are formed the primary curvature is retained only in thoracic and sacral regions which are known as primary curvatures they are concave anteriorly secondary curvatures formed after birth the first cervical curvature develops at about 03 months of birth then the child can hold his head upright second lumbar curvature develops when the child is around 78 months then the child can hold his body upright these secondary curvatures are convex towards the anterior,the human skull consists of 22 bones divided into two main regions the cranium and the facial bones the cranium protects the brain and houses structures such as the inner ear and eye sockets it contains fontanelles that allow compression during childbirth and sinuses that lighten the skull and enhance voice resonance the facial region includes bones that support the nasal cavity and house the teeth key features include the maxilla upper jaw and mandible movable lower jaw the vertebral column is a flexible structure made up of 26 bones arranged in distinct regions cervical 7 vertebrae thoracic 12 lumbar 5 sacrum 5 fused and coccyx 4 fused it has four curvescervical thoracic lumbar and sacralthat maintain an upright posture primary curvatures are present at birth while secondary curvatures develop later to support head and body stability
structure of a typical vertebra a lumbar vertebra can be considered a typical vertebra a typical vertebra consists of the body and the vertebral arch the body is the largest broad and flattened part of the vertebrae the flattened surface of the body of each vertebra articulates with the corresponding surface of the adjacent vertebra so that vertebrae are stacked together in the vertebral column however the adjacent two vertebrae are not in direct contact with each other as there is a tough pad of cartilage called intervertebral disc between the two vertebrae the size of the body of the vertebra increases downwards of the vertebral column to support the body weight vertebral arch encloses vertebral foramen which provides passage way for the spinal cord processes arising from the neural arch provide surfaces for muscle attachment two lateral processes are called transverse processes and the posterior process is called spinous process the vertebral arch has four articular surfaces two superior articular surfaces articulate with the adjacent vertebrae above and two inferior articular surfaces region specific vertebral characteristics cervical vertebrae cervical vertebrae are the first seven vertebrae in the vertebral column when compared to the other types of vertebra cervical vertebrae are the smallest body of the cervical vertebra is smaller compared to the other vertebrae in addition transverse processes of a cervical vertebra have a foramen on each side to provide passage for the vertebral artery the spinous process of most of these vertebrae is bifid the first cervical vertebra is the atlas which is the bone on which the skull rests it is a ring shaped vertebra with no distinct body or spinous processes it has two short transverse processes the atlas contains two flattened facets which articulate with the occipital bone of the skull condyloid joints permitting nodding movements vertebral foramen of this vertebra is relatively larger to provide the passage of the larger upper part of the spinal cord the second cervical vertebra is the axis it has a small body with a superior projections called odontoid process which articulates with the atlas vertebra above the head pivots turns on side to side on this joint thoracic vertebra the twelve thoracic vertebrae are larger than cervical vertebrae as this region of the vertebral column has to support more body weight the body and transverse processes of thoracic vertebrae have facets for articulation with the ribs lumbar vertebrae the five lumbar vertebrae are the largest of the vertebrae because they have to support the weight of the upper body the size of the body of the lumbar vertebrae is larger compared to the other vertebrae for attachment of the muscles of lower back the lumbar vertebrae have relatively large spinal processes sacrum and coccyx sacrum is a triangular shaped large bone consisting of five fused rudimentary vertebrae it has a concave anterior surface the upper part articulates with the fifth lumbar vertebrae on each side sacrum articulates with the pelvic girdle inferior tip of the sacrum articulates with coccyx a series of vertebral foramina are present on each side for passage of nerves coccyx consists of fused four terminal vertebrae to form a small triangular bone the broad base of the coccyx articulates with the tip of the sacrum common functions of the human vertebral column the vertebral column helps to maintain the erect posture it supports the skull and articulates to ribs and girdles it also provides the protection for the spinal cord vertebral foramens provide spaces for spinal nerves and blood vessels and lymph vessels the vertebral column allows flexibility in the body movements the intervertebral discs act as shock absorbers and protect the spinal cord sternum sternum is a long flat bone that forms anterior part of the thoracic cage which is made up of sternum ribs and thoracic vertebrae the uppermost section of the sternum is the manubrium which articulates with the clavicles in the pectoral girdles and the first two pairs of ribs the body which is the middle part of the sternum gives attachment to the rest of the ribs the xiphoid process is the tip of the bone which gives attachment to the diaphragm and muscles of the anterior abdominal wall the sternum provides protection to the organs and blood vessels that lie behind it heart and lungs from physical damage the red bone marrow in the sternum is one of the main sites for production of blood cells ribs the twelve pairs of ribs form the lateral walls of the thoracic cage they are elongated curved bones they articulate posteriorly with the thoracic vertebrae of the vertebral column anteriorly 7 pairs of ribs articulate with the sternum true ribs next 3 pairs articulate with sternum indirectly in both cases costal cartilages attach the ribs to the sternum the lowest 2 pairs do not join the sternum floating ribs head of the rib articulates with vertebral bodies facets of tubercle articulate with transverse process of vertebrae the thoracic cage which includes the ribs and sternum plays an important role in the mechanism of breathing between each ribs intercostal muscles are present which move the rib cage during breathing the first rib is firmly fixed to the sternum and to the first thoracic vertebra therefore it does not move during inspiration because it is a fixed point when the intercostal muscle contract they pull the entire rib cage upwards and towards the first ribs presence of 12 pairs of ribs and sternum provides protection to the organs such as lungs and heart in the thoracic cavity contribution of human axial skeleton to maintain the upright posture presence of two primary curvatures and two secondary curvatures in the vertebral column development of the two secondary curvatures in the vertebral column mainly contribute to maintain the erect posture refer the section on curvatures of vertebral column the size of the vertebrae especially the body of the vertebrae become larger towards the end of the vertebral column as they have to support the weight of the upper body refer the section on vertebrae the sacral vertebrae are fused to form a triangular shaped large sacrum to support the weight of the vertebral column and internal organs of the body the two occipital condyles and the foramen magnum are located inferiorly at the base of the skull close to the center in the upright position this arrangement permits proper balancing of the skull on the vertebral column,the human axial skeleton consists of the vertebral column sternum and ribs providing support protection and flexibility the vertebral column made up of 26 vertebrae has distinct regions cervical thoracic lumbar sacrum and coccyx key features include curvatures the vertebral column has four curves cervical thoracic lumbar sacral maintaining erect posture intervertebral discs these cartilage pads cushion the vertebrae and absorb shock vertebra structure a typical vertebra includes a body vertebral arch and processes for muscle attachment the sternum composed of three sections manubrium body xiphoid process protects vital organs and serves as a blood cell production site the twelve pairs of ribs form the thoracic cage protecting the heart and lungs while facilitating breathing through intercostal muscles the structure of the axial skeleton including the size and arrangement of vertebrae contributes to upright posture
appendicular skeleton the appendicular skeleton consists of upper limbs with pectoral shoulder girdle and lower limbs with the pelvic girdle through the pectoral girdle the upper limb forms the joints with the trunk pectoral girdle connects upper limb with the axial skeleton pectoral girdle consists of two scapulae shoulder blades and two clavicles collar bones the lower limb forms a joint with the trunk at the pelvic girdle pelvic girdle is formed from two hip bones and it is associated with the sacrum upper limb upper limb consists of humerus bone of the upper arm radius and ulna bones in the fore arm eight carpal bones wrist bones five metacarpal bones in the palm and fourteen phalanges bones of the digits the adaptation of the human upper limb for movement through a wide range structure of upper limb is adapted for grasping weight lifting and movement over a wide range head of the humerus the bone of the upper arm forms an incomplete ball and socket joint shoulder joint in glenoid cavity of the scapula permitting a vast range of movements the joint allows for flexion extension adduction abduction rotation and circumduction the distal end of the humerus has two articular surfaces through these surfaces radius and ulna articulate with the humerus at the elbow joint they articulate with the carpal bones at the wrist joint further ulna and radius are articulated with each other at the proximal and distal radioulnar joints in addition a fibrous joint connects the bones along their shafts which stabilize their association and maintain their relative position in spite of forces applied from the elbow or wrist the elbow joint acts as a hinge joint which permits only flexion and extension of the forearm the carpal bones which are arranged in two rows proximal row and distal row are closely fitted together so that there is limited amount of movement between them proximal row bones are associated with the wrist joint and distal row bones form joints with metacarpal bones wrist joint is present between the distal end of radius and three proximal carpal bones this arrangement allows pronation turning palm down and supination turning palm up of the lower part of the upper limb in addition the wrist can be flexed extended abducted and adducted the proximal ends of metacarpal bones in the palm articulate with carpal bones and their distal ends articulate with phalanges the joints between metacarpal and phalanges allow movement of the fingers and permit the power grip fingers may be flexed extended adducted abducted and circumducted with the first finger more flexible than the other the joint present at the base of the thumb between a specific carpal bone and the first metacarpal bone allows more mobility to the thumb than the other fingers this leads to opposable nature of the thumb which permits the thumb to move perpendicular to the other fingers this articulation permits precision grip which is unique to man lower limb lower limb consists of femur thigh bone tibia shin bone fibula patella knee cap seven tarsal bones ankle bones five metatarsal bones bones of the foot and fourteen phalanges toe bones adaptations of the lower limb for the erect posture bearing of body weight and walking femur is the longest heaviest and the strongest bone of the body head of the femur forms the hip joint ball and socket joint with the acetabulum of the hipbone of the pelvis this hip joint is very sturdy and powerful as it bears all body weight when standing the lower limb can be extended flexed abducted adducted rotated and circumducted at the hip joint lower end of femur articulates with tibia and patella to form the knee joint tibia is the medial of the two bones possible movements at the knee joint are flexion extension and a rotatory movement that locks the joint when it is fully extended when this joint is locked it is possible to stand upright fora long period of time femur transmits the weight of the body through the bones below the knee to the foot all the lower ends of both tibia and fibula articulate with a specific tarsal bone to form the ankle joint the ankle joint allows rising in tip toe and lifting toes towards the calf the arrangement of bones in the foot supported by associated ligaments and muscles gives the sole of the foot an arch edora curved shape the bones of the foot are arranged in two arches the longitudinal arch and the transverse arch curve running heel to toe is called the longitudinal arch and the curve running across the foot is called the transverse arch in the upright position these arches of the foot are important in distributing the weight of the body evenly whether stationary or moving,the appendicular skeleton comprises the upper and lower limbs including the pectoral and pelvic girdles upper limb bones humerus radius ulna carpal bones metacarpal bones and phalanges joints the shoulder joint ball and socket allows a wide range of movements flexion extension rotation the elbow joint functions as a hinge joint allowing only flexion and extension the wrist facilitates movements like pronation and supination lower limb bones femur tibia fibula patella tarsal bones metatarsal bones and phalanges adaptations the femur supports body weight and allows various movements at the hip joint the knee joint enables flexion extension and locking for stability the foot has two arches longitudinal and transverse that distribute body weight key functions provides support and mobility allows for a range of movements essential for grasping walking and maintaining an upright posture
osteoporosis osteoporosis is a condition associated with the reduction of bone density due to the exceedance of the bone reabsorption rate over the deposition rate this gives in fragility to the bone tissue this condition leads to immobility in joints and may cause fractures skeletal deformities and bone pain factors causing osteoporosis include hormonal imbalances especially at menopause calcium deficiency and environmental factors osteoarthritis osteoarthritis is a degenerative noninflammatory disease that causes pain and restricted movements in the affected joints articular cartilage at the joints gradually become thinner so that articular surfaces of the bones come in contact and eventually the bones begin to degenerate the outcome is pain the cause of osteoarthritis is unknown but risk factors include excessive use of affected joints female gender aging heredity and obesity slipped disc the bodies of adjacent vertebrae are separated by intervertebral discs which serve as shock absorbers these intervertebral discs consist of an outer ring of cartilage and a central core of soft gelatinous material an injury or weakness can cause the inner portion of the intervertebral disc to protrude through the outer ring this condition is called slipped disc this leads to pain and discomfort if the slipped disc compresses a spinal nerve there can be numbness and pain along the affected nerve slipped disc condition can arise when lifting heavy weights without bending knees main types of joints in the human skeletal system main types of the joints in the human skeletal system are ball and socket joint hinge joint and pivot joint ball and socket joints in these joints ball shaped head is connected with the cup shaped socket and allows for wide range movements such as flexion extension adduction abduction rotation and circumduction there are two ball and socket joints available in the human body shoulder joint and hip joint refer upper limb and lower limb hinge joints the articulating ends of the bone fit together in such a way so it looks like a hinge of a door this allows only restricted movements such as flexion and extensions examples for hinge joints are elbow joint knee joint ankle joint and joints between the phalanges of the fingers and toes refer upper limb and lower limb pivot joints one bone fits into a hoop shaped ligament that holds it close to another bone and allows it to rotate in the ring formed by the ligament these joints allow a bone or limb to rotate for example head rotates by the pivot joint formed by the atlas vertebrae within the transverse ligament ring and odontoid process of the axis refer vertebral column skeletal muscle and mechanism of contraction features of skeletal muscle tissue the skeletal muscles are generally attached to the skeletal system and mainly cause voluntary body movements skeletal muscle tissue is composed of bundles of long cylindrical cells these cells are aligned parallel to each other along the length of the muscle each cell contain multiple nuclei close to the cell membrane inside the cell bundles of myofibrils containing contractile microfilaments are located longitudinally along the length of the cell myofibrils in the muscle cell form by repeating sections called sarcomeres the repeating arrangement of sarcomeres within the skeletal muscle cell gives its striated appearance under the microscope sarcomeres are the basic contractile units of the striated muscle cell like smooth muscle cells and cardiac muscle cells skeletal muscle cells show excitability or irritability ability to receive and respond to stimuli contractility ability to contract or shorten extensibility ability to stretch or contract and elasticity ability to return to its original length after being stretched or contracted the skeletal muscle is under the voluntary control of the somatic nervous system structure of the sarcomere basic mechanism of skeletal muscle movement sarcomeres are the repeating contractile units present within a striated muscle cell the myofibrils is composed of contractile thick filaments and thin filaments which are made up of specific proteins the thin filaments formed mainly from actin protein attached at the z line a dense stripe which forms the borders of the sarcomere the thick filaments formed from myosin protein are fixed at the m line in the middle region of the sarcomere sarcomeres are found repeatedly between two z lines in a skeletal muscle cell at the resting stage of myofibrils thick and thin filaments are partially overlapped at the edge of the sarcomere there are only thin filaments while at the center of the sarcomere only thick filaments are present such arrangement of thick and thin filaments in the sarcomeres permits the shortening of the skeletal muscle cell during contraction and return to the original state during relaxation the mechanical function arising from sarcomeres is produced by actin and myosin proteins the skeletal muscle contraction is mainly voluntary and under the control of the somatic nervous system upon stimulation individual muscle cells in the skeletal muscle shortens due to the shortening of its sarcomeres and thus the whole muscle may contract converting muscle contraction to movement needs a skeleton to which the muscles attach skeletal muscle contractions pull on the tendons attached to the bones if contraction of the muscle causes the muscle to shorten the bone and the body part will move when the nervous stimulation is stopped the muscles will return to the original length after being contracted,osteoporosis is a condition characterized by reduced bone density resulting from bone resorption exceeding deposition leading to fragile bones and potential fractures risk factors include hormonal changes calcium deficiency and environmental influences osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease causing pain and limited movement due to the thinning of articular cartilage it is linked to factors like aging obesity and excessive joint use slipped disc occurs when the inner portion of an intervertebral disc protrudes causing pain and potentially compressing spinal nerves it often results from improper lifting techniques types of joints ball and socket joints allow for a wide range of movements eg shoulder hip hinge joints permit limited movement such as flexion and extension eg elbow knee pivot joints enable rotation eg between the atlas and axis vertebrae skeletal muscle is responsible for voluntary movements made of long cylindrical cells with multiple nuclei the sarcomere the basic contractile unit consists of thick myosin and thin actin filaments muscle contraction occurs when these filaments slide past each other allowing skeletal muscles to shorten and produce movement
self or cross pollination between these f1 generation plants is known as f generation second filial generation an organism that is heterozygous with respect to a single gene of interest resulting from a cross between parents having homozygous condition for different alleles of specific gene is referred to as a monohybrid breeding experiments conducted between two organisms with heterozygous condition for a specific character is referred to as monohybrid cross an organism that is heterozygous with respect to two genes of interest resulting from a cross between parents having homozygous conditions for different alleles of two specific genes is referred to as a dihybrid breeding experiment conducted between two organisms with heterozygous conditions for two specific characters is referred to as a dihybrid cross breeding an organism having unknown genotype for a specific dominant trait with an organism having homozygous recessive condition for the same specific trait is called a test cross this is usually done to reveal the unknown genotypes for specific dominant traits in an organism monohybrid cross mendel derived his first law of inheritance by following only a single character in one breeding experiment such as flower color he started by crossing pure breeding parents with contrasting traits all the f progeny produced from pure breeding parents are monohybrids meaning that they are heterozygous for the particular character being followed in the cross mendel during his experiment crossed pure breeding purple flowered plants and white flowered plants then he allowed the resulting f hybrids to self and crosspollinate with other f hybrids finally he observed the f generation plants for the color of the flowers during his observation all f plants produced purple color flowers however in the f generation both purple and white flowered plants appeared in a ratio of approximately 3 1 among the heterozygote resulted in the f generation the heritable factor responsible for producing white flowers were suppressed in presence of the heritable factor that produces purple flowers as a result the heterozygotes were all producing purple color flowers therefore the heritable factor for purple flower color is dominant to the white dominant trait accordingly the factor for white flower color is referred as the recessive trait mendel observed that the same pattern of inheritance consistently occurred in six other characters position of the flower color of the seed shape of the seed shape of the pod color of the pod and the length of the stem mendels first law of inheritance the law of segregation mendels first law was put forward to explain the 31 inheritance pattern observed among the f offspring in his monohybrid experiments using pea plants as per his hypothesis each heritable character is determined by two heritable factors which are known as alleles during the formation of gametes the alleles for a heritable character are separated and get in to each of the gametes formed this is now known as mendels law of segregation or mendels first law in inheritance analyzing genotype and phenotype ratios using punnett square in pea plants mendel observed two different traits based on stem lengths tall and dwarf for his experiments pure breeding tall and dwarf pea plants were selected for cross pollination thereafter the f generation was self pollinated in order to obtain f generation during self pollination of f hybrids gametes carrying different alleles fuse randomly such random fusion of gametes produces zygotes with four genetic combinations a punnett square can be used to illustrate these genetic combinations a punnett square is a graphical representation of the possible genotypes of an offspring arising from a particular cross or breeding event dihybrid cross mendel identified his second law of inheritance by following two characters at the same time using dihybrid crosses a cross between two heterozygous organisms with contrasting traits for two specific characters being followed is known as a dihybrid breeding experiment conducted between two organisms with heterozygous conditions for two specific characters is referred to as a dihybrid cross the aim of the mendels dihybrid cross experiment was to find out whether the alleles for one character assort into gametes dependently or independently of the alleles of the other character mendel crossed a truebreeding plant with yellowround seeds with a true breeding plant with greenwrinkled seeds figure 63 the cross produced dihybrid f plants all of which have yellowround seeds as shown by the monohybrid crosses the allele for yellow seeds is dominant y over the allele for green seeds y which is recessive likewise the allele for round seed is dominant r and the allele for wrinkled seed is recessive r the f hybrids are heterozygous for the two characters being followed in the cross yyrr the cross between f dihybrids produced the f generation this lead towards two alternative hypothesis for inheritance which predict different phenotypic ratios 1 the two characters could be transmitted from parents to offspring as a package the dominant y and r alleles or the recessive y and r alleles are passed together generation after generation this is called dependent assortment of alleles according to this hypothesis only two types of gametes are possible ie yr and yr thus the phenotypic ratio of the f generation would be similar to that of a monohybrid cross 31 2 the two characters seed colour and seed shape could be transmitted from parents to offspring independent of each other ie y allele could be passed either with r or r allele vice versa this is called independent assortment of alleles this hypothesis predicts four different allelic combinations for a biallelic locus and thus four different types of gametes from f generation ie yr yr yr and yr according to this both male and female gametes have four possibilities for each therefore during the union of male and female gametes there are 16 4 x 4 equally probable ways in which the alleles can combine to produce the f generation as shown in figure 3 these combinations would give rise to four different phenotypes with a ratio of 9331 nine yellow round to three greenround to three yellowwrinkled to one greenwrinkled mendels experiment produced the four distinct phenotypes yellowround greenround yellowwrinkled and greenwrinkled seeds predicted in the second alternative hypothesis in the ratio of 9331 this showed that the alleles responsible for each trait assorted independently of those of the other mendels second law of inheritance the law of independent assortment based on these experiments mendel put forward his second law of inheritance the law of independent assortment the law states that alleles separate and pair up independently during the formation of gametes as a result of that two or more genes assort independently irrespective of the other however according to current knowledge this condition applies to two circumstances only to genes located on different chromosomes genes on nonhomologous chromosomes to genes located far apart on the same chromosome,the f1 generation plants can undergo self or crosspollination leading to the f2 generation a monohybrid is an organism heterozygous for one gene resulting from a cross between homozygous parents with different alleles a monohybrid cross involves breeding two heterozygous organisms for one character a dihybrid is heterozygous for two genes and a dihybrid cross involves two organisms heterozygous for two characters test cross is used to reveal unknown genotypes of dominant traits by crossing with a homozygous recessive mendels first law the law of segregation explains the 31 inheritance pattern observed in monohybrid experiments his second law the law of independent assortment states that alleles segregate independently during gamete formation leading to a 9331 phenotypic ratio in dihybrid crosses
mendel followed a scientific approach in conducting his experiments the following features in his experiments helped him to unravel the two fundamental principles of heredity mendel carried out thousands of genetic crosses of any given kind this allowed his results to closely resemble the probability predictions usually the larger the sample size the closer the results to the value predicted based on the probability he kept accurate records of his results these records helped him to trace the patterns which otherwise would go unnoticed he usually followed up each cross for at least two offspring generations f and f this helped him to uncover some of the traits hidden in the f generation he did a quantitative analysis of the phenotypes of the resulting offspring desirable properties in garden peas for genetic experiments garden peas pisum sativum carry following desirable properties which makes it a suitable organism to study patterns of inheritance pea plants are available in many varieties with contrasting traits the generation time is short a large number of offspring is produced from each cross crossing between the plants could be strictly controlled self cross pollination probability laws and mendelian inheritance mendels laws of segregation and independent assortment reflect the same rules of probability that applies to tossing coins rolling dice and drawing cards from a deck probability measures how likely an event is to occur out of the number of possible outcomes it is calculated by dividing the number of events of interest by the number of total possible outcomes 1 the probability scale ranges from 0 to 1 an event that is certain to occur has a probability of 1 while an event that is certain not to occur has a probability of 0 during allele segregation in a f plant heterozygous of a monohybrid cross probability of each egg carrying the dominant allele 12 probability of each egg carrying the recessive allele 12 2 the probabilities of all possible outcomes for an event add up to 1 during allele segregation in a heterozygous f plant probability of all events having dominant and recessive alleles 12 12 1 3 when the occurrence of an event does not affect the occurrence of another event independent events the probability of simultaneous occurrence of both events can be obtained by multiplying the probability of one event by the probability of the other event this is known as the multiplication rule or product rule in probability in mendels monohybrid crosses for a f plant to have wrinkled seeds rr both the egg and the sperm that come together must carry the r allele the probability that the egg will have an r 12 the probability that the sperm will have an r 12 the probability of both gametes at fertilization carrying r allele x 14 4 the probability that any one of two or more mutually exclusive events will occur is calculated by adding their individual probabilities this is the addition rule or sum rule of probability there are two possible mutually exclusive ways for producing f heterozygotes i the dominant allele come from the egg and the recessive allele from the sperm the probability of the event 14 according to example in above 3rd sentence ii the recessive allele from the egg and the dominant allele from the sperm the probability of the event 14according to example in above 3rd sentence so the probability of getting an f heterozygote 14 14 12 prediction of the inheritance patterns in multifactorial crosses when the pattern of inheritance of two or more characters of an organism is being traced during a genetic cross it could be called as multifactorial cross finding out the outcomes of a multifactorial cross through a punnett square may be a difficult task therefore applying rules of probability may be useful to predict the outcomes of a multifactorial crossing the testcross this is a deliberate breeding process performed in order to determine the unknown genotypes the genotype of an individual showing dominant trait may be due either to double dominant genotype or to heterozygous status this involves the crossing of an organism having unknown genotype for a selected phenotype along with another organism from same species having homozygous recessive condition for same character testcross performed during the monohybrid cross is called as monohybrid testcross on the other hand test cross performed during the dihybrid cross is called as dihybrid testcross monohybrid testcross lets consider an example for monohybrid testcross in this example we want to know the genotype of the given tall pea plants in order to do that we will cross the tall pea plant with the dwarf pea plant since dwarf is a recessive trait the genotype of it will be tt there may be two possible genotypes for tall pea plants i tt 2 tt assume that unknown pea plant is having genotype of tt dihybrid testcross when an individual with dominant traits for two characters eg rrbb is crossed with a pure recessive for both characters rrbb it is known as a dihybrid testcross for example lets consider a cross between plants having red coloured flower petals with black coloured seeds and white coloured flower petals with brown coloured seeds the possible genotypes for red coloured petals with black coloured seeds are rrbb rrbbrrbb rrbb and for white coloured petals with brown coloured seeds is rrbb if the unknown phenotype is rrbb,mendels scientific approach in studying heredity involved conducting extensive genetic crosses maintaining accurate records and analyzing multiple generations of offspring his choice of garden peas pisum sativum was ideal due to their diverse traits short generation time and high offspring yield key principles of probability underlie mendelian inheritance including probability scale ranges from 0 to 1 indicating certainty 1 or impossibility 0 of an event addition rule total probabilities of mutually exclusive events sum to 1 multiplication rule for independent events multiply individual probabilities to find the probability of simultaneous occurrences mendel also employed test crosses to determine unknown genotypes by crossing dominant phenotype plants with homozygous recessive ones monohybrid test crosses focus on a single trait while dihybrid test crosses examine two traits
common mendelian characters many human traits follow mendelian patterns of inheritance some common examples are stated below attached or detached earlobe the extent to which the earlobe is attached to the head is inherited in the mendelian pattern the attached earlobe is a recessive trait presence of both copies of the recessive allele homozygous recessive condition for ear lobe attachment would result in attached ear lobe widows peak the pointed contour of the hairline on the forehead is known as widows peak it is due to a dominant allele w therefore all individuals who lack a widows peak must be homozygous recessive ww dimples on cheek cheek dimples are a genetically transmitted trait found in the muscle of the cheek when a person smiles the shorter muscle on the face pulls up the facial skin this in turn creates a slight depression in the skin which is called dimple dimples often occur on both the cheeks a single dimple on one cheek is a rare phenomenon dimple is a dominant trait and inherited in mendelian fashion bent thumb hitchhikers thumb and straight thumb hitchhikers thumbs is a condition where thumb bend backwards while stretching due to the hyper extensibility of interphalangeal joints having the dominant s allele would produce the dominant phenotype of straight thumb the absence of the dominant alleles would allow the thumb to bend rolling or nonrolling tongue the ability to roll the lateral edges of the tongue upwards into a tube is known as tongue rolling the tongues intrinsic muscles allow some people to form their tongues into specific shapes rolling the tongue into a tube shape is a dominant trait with simple mendelian inheritance pedigree analysis diagrammatic representation of the inheritance of a particular trait within a given family tree is called pedigree chart it is constructed by collecting data for many generations within a given family so that the pattern of inheritance can be understood common mendelian characteristics in humans analyzed with pedigree charts widows peak the inheritance of the trait widows peak over three generations in a particular family is represented in the pedigree chart given below as shown in figure 67 only one grand parent had widows peak out of the two pairs since widows peak is a dominant character grand parents without widows peak should be homozygous recessive ww for the trait in the next generation some individuals showed the widows peak while the others did not the two grand parents who express the widows peak should be heterozygous ww for the condition likewise the two parents of the third generation who are showing widows peak should be heterozygous for it as one of both their parents 1 generation are homozygous recessive ww the third generation with widows peak can carry either ww or ww genotype as both their parents are having the trait attached earlobe attached earlobe as explained earlier isa recessively inherited character in the pedigree chart given below the in hesitance of the trait is analyzed in the same family that was used to study the widows peak the dominant allele which is causing the free ear lobe is denoted with f while recessive allele is denoted with fi n the first generation both parents lacking the attachment of ear lobes resulted mixed progenies with attached and free ear lobes this tells us that those two parents were heterozygous ff and among the progeny two males with attached ear lobes carry homozygous recessive alleles ff and a male and female with free ear lobe may carry heterozygous ff or homozygous dominant alleles ff another cross happened at the first generation between a male with attached ear lobe and a female with free ear lobe this resulted one daughter with attached ear lobe therefore she must possess ff and the other must be ff a male from one family and a female from another family at the second generation expressing free ear lobe phenotype had resulted progeny having two females one with attached ear lobes and the other with free ear lobes for the third generation therefore the second generation male and female crossed with free year lobes must be ff third generation female with attached car lobes must carry ff genotype and the other may carry either ff or ff the probability that another child from the same family will have attached earlobes could be calculated using a monohybrid cross ff x ff since homozygous recessive ff genotype is causing the condition the probability is 14 for each child the chance that a child born to the family will have both the widows peak and attached earlobes can be calculated using probability rules assuming that the alleles corresponding to the two characters are on different chromosomes the two pairs of alleles assort independently in this dihybrid cross wwff x wwff,many human traits exhibit mendelian inheritance patterns key examples include attached or detached earlobes attached earlobes recessive trait require homozygous recessive alleles ff widows peak the pointed hairline dominant trait results from the dominant allele w individuals without it are homozygous recessive ww dimples dimples are a dominant trait influenced by a single allele thumb shape straight thumbs are dominant s while hitchhikers thumbs are recessive tongue rolling the ability to roll the tongue is a dominant trait pedigree analysis is a tool used to trace inheritance patterns across generations in a pedigree for widows peak grandparents showed different genotypes ww or ww affecting their offspring the probability of traits like widows peak and attached earlobes can be calculated using monohybrid and dihybrid crosses applying mendelian principles of inheritance
nonmendelian inheritance refers to inheritance patterns in which traits do not segregate in accordance with mendels laws of inheritance phenotypes that do not appear in ratios predicted by mendelian genetics are the indicators of nonmendelian inheritance examples for nonmendelian patterns when alleles are not completely dominant or recessive incomplete dominance and codominance when a particular gene has more than two alleles polyallelism when a single gene produces multiple phenotypes pleiotropy sometimes two or more genes are involved in determining a particular phenotype epistasis and polygenic inheritance gene linkage genes which are located in sex chromosomes exhibit a different pattern of inheritance in males and females due to the unequal distribution of genes in their sex chromosomes incomplete dominance the phenomenon of dominant allele completely masking the recessive phenotype resulting similar phenotypes for both homozygous dominant zygote as well as heterozygous zygote is called complete dominance on the other hand at the heterozygous state the phenomenon of expressing blend phenotypes from both alleles is called incomplete dominance degree of expression of each allele in the blend phenotypes may vary based on the nature of the alleles in mirabilis jalapa four oclock plant there are several types of flower colours when red flowered plants are crossed with white flowered plants all the f hybrids heterozygotes have pink flowers figure 68 this third intermediate phenotype results from flowers of the heterozygotes having less red pigment than the red homozygotes codominance in certain traits at heterozygote state expression of both alleles contributes equally to the phenotype such phenomenon is called codominance for example a person with ab blood group type has both a and b carbohydrates on the surface of red blood cells at the same time the two carbohydrates are added to the surface of rbc by enzymes encoded by the i and i alleles of a single gene a heterozygous individual would express both carbohydrates ii in an equal manner polyallelism multiple alleles polyallelism refers to the presence of multiple alleles for a single genetic locus a phenomenon where certain traits are determined by the combination of more than two types of alleles eg there are three alleles called i a and i b and i for a single genetic locus which at different combinations determine abo blood groups in humans in any diploid individual there are only two of the several alleles are present as mentioned earlier the alleles i a and i b code for enzymes that add a and b carbohydrates to the surface of red blood cells the two alleles are in a codominant relationship however the allele i results in lack of these carbohydrates on the red cell surface and it is recessive to both i a and i b alleles therefore both i a i and i b i genotypes will result in dominant phenotypes ie having either the a or b carbohydrates the ii genotype will result in the recessive trait of not having either of the carbohydrates thus based on the presence of the two carbohydrates a persons blood group may be one of four types as follows type a carbohydrate a present type b carbohydrate b present type ab both carbohydrates a b present or type o neither of the two carbohydrates present,nonmendelian inheritance describes genetic patterns that do not conform to mendels laws key examples include incomplete dominance in heterozygotes a blend of traits occurs as seen in the pink flowers of the four oclock plant mirabilis jalapa from red and white parents codominance both alleles express equally such as in ab blood type where both a and b carbohydrates are present on red blood cells polyallelism more than two alleles can exist for a single gene locus exemplified by the abo blood group system in humans where alleles i a i b and i determine blood type pleiotropy a single gene influences multiple phenotypes epistasis two or more genes interact to determine a phenotype gene linkage genes located close together on a chromosome tend to be inherited together understanding these patterns expands the knowledge of genetic inheritance beyond simple mendelian ratios
epistasis is the phenomenon resulting from interactions between genes of different loci the alteration in the phenotypic expression of a gene at one locus is due to the interference of another gene at a different locus epistasis could be categorized into two types dominant epistasis and recessive epistasis based on the nature of the gene interaction this causes deviation from the phenotype ratios of mendelian principles dominant epistasis when a dominant allele at a specific locus alters the expression of a separate gene at a different locus it is referred to as dominant epistasis dominant epistasis is seen in the plumage colour of house fowls consider the following experiment a cross between a known homozygous double dominant white house fowl and a homozygous double recessive white house fowl results a 100 white f progeny f generation produced from a cross between these f individuals consists of white and coloured fowls in the ratio of 133 the colour of these two fowl varieties are determined by two separate genes the gene c c is responsible for producing colour in the feathers the dominant c allele produces colour while the recessive c allele result in the absence of pigmentation the gene i is epistatic to gene c and suppresses the expression of the colour the dominant i allele prevents production of pigments while recessive 1 allele is unable to prevent coloration as a result the double dominant homozygous ccii house fowl is white dominant i allele prevents coloration the double homozygous recessive house fowl ccil is white recessive c allele couldnt produce colour the f generation all consist of heterozygous ccli fowls due to the inhibitory effect of the dominant i allele all f individuals are white when these fowls are allowed to interbreed the f generation genotypes carrying inhibitory i allele will give rise to white colour plumage despite the presence of the dominant c allele the presence of dominant c allele in the absence of inhibitory t allele gives rise to coloured fowls as per the mendelian principles genotype ratios in both f and f generation are expected to be similar to the genotype ratios seen in a normal dihybrid cross however due to the effect of epistasis phenotype ratio would deviate from mendels principles for normal dihybrid cross f phenotypic ratio may get altered from 9331 to 133 recessive epistasis when a homozygous recessive genotype of a particular chromosomal locus alters masks the expression of a separate gene at a different locus it is referred to as recessive epistasis a good example for recessive epistasis is found for flower colour in sweet pea lathyrus plant there are purple flowered and white flowered varieties across between homozygous dominant purple flower aabb and homozygous recessive white flower aabb strains produced 100 purple colour flowers in f generation inter breeding of f plants produced f generation with purple and white flower plants in a ratio of 9 7 the purple colour in sweet pea flower is governed by two dominant genes a and b both a and b alleles are coding for compounds that are necessary for the expression of purple colour hence purple colour will be there only when both the dominant alleles a and b are present double recessive genotype at any locus aabb aabb aabb or aabb results white flowers by masking the expression of purple colour thus double recessive genotype at any of the above locus is epistatic to either homozygous dominant aa and bb or heterozygous condition aa and bb of the other aabb aabb aabb aabb aabb white and aabb aabb aabb aabbpurplefiguer 613 all of the f generation plants were found to express purple flowers due to the presence of heterozygous condition at both loci aabb in f generation plants having genotypes with both a and b alleles 916 express purple flowers and plants having genotypes with aa and a b allele 316 or a allele and bb alleles 316 and aabb genotype 116 produce white flowers thus only two phenotypic classes are expressed purple and white thus the normal dihybrid phenotype ratio as per mendelian principles 933 1 is changed to 9 7 ratios in f generation,epistasis is the interaction between genes at different loci that alters the phenotypic expression of a gene it is categorized into two types dominant epistasis a dominant allele at one locus suppresses the expression of a gene at another locus for example in house fowls the dominant allele i inhibits color production by the c gene resulting in a 133 phenotypic ratio instead of the expected 9331 ratio recessive epistasis a homozygous recessive genotype at one locus masks the expression of a gene at another locus in sweet peas both dominant alleles a and b are required for purple flowers if either gene is homozygous recessive the flowers are white leading to a 97 phenotypic ratio in the f generation these examples illustrate how epistasis can deviate from typical mendelian inheritance patterns
inheritance of a phenotype such as quantitative characters height skin colour intelligence quotient etc which results from a cumulative expression of two or more genes is called polygenic inheritance eg skin colour in humans is determined by many genes for simplicity only three genes are considered each gene a b or c has a darkskin allele contributing one unit of darkness to the phenotype and being incompletely dominant to the other allele a b or c therefore aabbcc person very dark skin aabbce person very light skin aabbcc person intermediate between skin colour because the dominant alleles from various loci have a cumulative effect on the skin colour campbell et al 2015 based on the number of genes involved in determining a polygenic character the phenotypic and genotypic combinations in the progenies may vary data for a polygenic character representing a population may result in a normal distribution curve the majority of offspring would be expected to have intermediate phenotypes skin colour in the middle range genetic linkage some genes coding for particular characters are located on the same chromosome and also at a closer distance thus they escape from crossing over and independent assortments occur during the meiotic cell division at gametogenesis and inherit together this results in deviation from mendels law of independent assortment the above phenomenon is called genetic linkage eg inheritance of body colour and wing size in the fruit fly drosophila in drosophila wildtype flies are found to have gray bodies and normalsized wings due to mutation for the above traits body colour becomes black and wings become vestigial both characters are determined by genes of autosomal chromosomes in this example the mutant alleles are recessive to the wildtype alleles the alleles for body colour are indicated as g gray and g black and those for wing size are indicated as n normal and n vestigial to examine the above wild type flies were crossed with flies which are mutant to both body color as well as wing size and followed by a dihybrid test cross,polygenic inheritance refers to the genetic determination of quantitative traits such as height skin color and intelligence through the cumulative effect of multiple genes for example skin color in humans is influenced by three genes a b and c each with a darkskin allele contributing to a unit of darkness the phenotype varies based on the combination of these alleles leading to a range of skin colors from very light aabbcc to very dark aabbcc with intermediate shades aabbcc this trait often displays a normal distribution curve in a population genetic linkage occurs when genes that code for specific traits are located close together on the same chromosome this proximity reduces the chances of crossing over during meiosis resulting in linked inheritance that deviates from mendels law of independent assortment for example in drosophila genes for body color and wing size are genetically linked affecting the traits inheritance patterns
sex is determined by the expression of sex chromosomes inhumans each individual carries 22 pairs of autosomal chromosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes type of sexchromosomes expressing male traits are named chromosome and the other as x chromosome comparatively x chromosome is bigger than y chromosome they both code for different traits except their homologous regions when x and y chromosomes pair up they remain homologous only in specific regions on the other hand when chromosome x pair up they both remain homologous to each other on the occurrence of gametogenesis in females meiosis yields haploid eggs carrying 100 x chromosomes whereas in males half the number of the haploid sperms produced carry x and the remaining half y chromosomes during the fertilization of male and female gametes the occasion where both egg and sperm carry x chromosomes results in a female zygote and on the other hand an occasions where an egg fuses with a sperm carrying y chromosome results in a male zygote thus any mating occasions between male and female organisms of same species leading to fertilization can have fifty percent chance for yielding either male or female zygotes anatomical sex signs develop in humans based on the expression of xx and xy chromosomal combination human sex linked characteristics certain characters of humans are carried on the genes located on the sex chromosomes those genes located on the sex chromosomes are called sex linked genes and the characters expressed by them are called sex linked characters characters expressed by or carried on the x chromosome are called x linked characters and the genes expressing or carrying those characters are called x linked genes on the other hand characters which are expressed by or carried on the y chromosome are called y linked genes and the genes expressing or carrying those characters are called y linked genes y chromosome carry only few genes other than those related to the sex some disorders carried on the ylinked genes are transferred and expressed only through male progeny inheritance of xlinked genes the inheritance of sex linked characters or genes differ for male and female due to the xx genotype of female and the xy genotype of male during the fertilization x chromosome from both of their biological parents result a female zygote and on the other hand x chromosome from the female parent and y chromosome from the male parent results a male zygote thus for females xlinked recessive disorders are expressed only at their homozygous genotype however in males due to the presence of only one x chromosome have only one recessive xlinked allele therefore having a recessive xlinked allele with disorder is sufficient for expression pleiotropy in some occasions expression of a single gene affects the expression of multiple traits which are not related to each other the above phenomenon is called as pleiotropy pleiotropic alleles are responsible for the multiple symptoms associated with certain hereditary diseases in humans such as cystic fibrosis and sicklecell disease sicklecell disease sickle cell disease is caused by an alteration in the hemoglobin protein of red blood cells a single gene mutation is responsible for the above condition in homozygous recessive individuals all the hemoglobins are of the sicklecell variety people living in high altitudes or under physical stress experience low oxygen content in their blood low oxygen content in the blood may induce the sicklecell hemoglobin proteins to get accumulated and results sickle shape in red blood cells sickle cells may clump and clog small blood vessels causing tissue and organ damage in several body parts this may result renal failure heart failure and thrombosis cystic fibrosis cystic fibrosis is a disease condition causing thicker and stickier mucus than its normal nature as a result mucus get accumulated in the pancreas lungs digestive tract and reproductive organs which cause lung infections respiratory failure poor digestion and infertility the thickening of mucus is due to the excess chlorine secretion of defected chloride channels of the plasma membrane the defect in the transmembrane chloride channel occurs as a result of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator cftr protein the altered cftr protein is due to the mutation of cftr gene this is identified as autosomal recessive disorder epigenetics study of occurrence of certain phenotypes of certain characters controlled by factors other than their dna sequence or genetic code is called epigenetics this is due to switching on and switching off of certain genes by modifying nucleotides of a dna sequence by methylation and demethylation where methyl groups are added to wild type dna sequence or else removed from a methylated dna sequence the above random occasions result different modified expression for a single dna sequence epigenetics results due to either inherited signals from parents or signals arising due to the environmental factors inheriting epigenetic traits from parents to the childrens generation is called epigenetic inheritance this may get reversed by various external stimuli from the environment some epigenetic influences result in inappropriate gene expressions leading to cancers schizophrenia is a mental disorder that occurs due to the genetic defects in some identical twins only one of them gets schizophrenia and the other does not get it this is due to two types of expressions for same dna sequence called epigenetics,sex determination in humans is based on the expression of sex chromosomes females have two x chromosomes xx while males have one x and one y chromosome xy during gametogenesis females produce eggs with only x chromosomes whereas males produce sperm with an equal mix of x and y chromosomes fertilization results in a 50 chance of male xy or female xx offspring key concepts sexlinked genes genes located on sex chromosomes with xlinked genes affecting traits in both sexes but being expressed differently due to the single x in males pleiotropy a phenomenon where a single gene affects multiple traits as seen in disorders like sicklecell disease and cystic fibrosis epigenetics the study of gene expression changes not due to dna sequence alterations but through modifications like methylation these changes can be inherited or influenced by environmental factors
hardyweinberg equilibrium hardyweinberg equilibrium is used to assess whether a population is evolving with respect to a particular characteristic genetic locus the genetic makeup of a trait in a population would remain unchanged if they are not evolving at that genetic locus therefore the predicted data for a particular trait of a population can be compared with the actual data obtained from the same population the comparison of both data as mentioned above may help to determine whether the population evolves or not for the considered trait hardyweinberg equilibrium principle in 1908 british mathematician gh hardy and german physician w weinberg independently showed that in a population that is not evolving allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation this is now considered as key concept in population genetics and referred to as hardyweinberg equilibrium principle to determine whether the allele and genotype frequencies have changed in consecutive generations a punnett square can be drawn considering the combination of alleles in all possible crosses in a population the following example can be used to work out the hardy weinberg equilibrium a wild flower plant population showing incomplete dominance for the flower colour alleles have distinct phenotypes indicating their genotypes 1e plants homozygous for the c r allele c r c r produce red pigment and have red flowers plants homozygous for the c w allele c w c w have white flowers heterozygous plants c r c w produce some red pigment and have pink flowers in the population of 500 flowers there were 800 c alleles and 200 cw alleles since the flower colour of the above plant type is determined by pair of alleles 500 flowers may consist of 1000 alleles for their flower petals pigmentation therefore allele frequency of c r alleles p 8001000 08 allele frequency of c w alleles q 2001000 02 if the gametes are formed at random the probability that an egg or sperm contains a c r or c w allele is equal to the frequency of each of these alleles in the population thus each egg has an 80 chance of containing a c r allele and a 20 chance of containing a c w allele the same is true during random fertilization gametes fuse together randomly therefore rule of multiplication can be applied to calculate the probability for each genotype combination according to hardyweinberg equilibrium if a character is determined by two alleles the three genotypes will appear in the following proportions p2 frequency of dominant homozygotes q2 frequency of the recessive homozygotes 2pq frequency of the heterozygotes the probability that two cr alleles will come together p x p p2 08 x 08 064 hence the proportion of cr cr genotype in the progeny 64 the probability that two cw alleles will come together q x q q2 02 x 02 004 hence the proportion of cw cw genotype in the progeny 4 cc heterozygotes can arise in two different ways if the sperm provides the cr allele and the egg provides the cw allele the resulting cr cw heterozygotes in the progeny p x q 08 x 02 016 16 if the egg provides the cw allele and the sperm the cr allele the resulting cr cw heterozygotes in the progeny q x p 02 x 08 016 16 thus the total frequency of heterozygote in the progeny pq gp 2pq 016 016 032 or 32 in the above example only three kinds of genotypes are possible when conditions suits for hardyweinberg equilibrium the sum of frequencies of all three genotypes equals 1 thus the equation for hardyweinberg equilibrium can be written as below p2 2pq q21 conditions for hardyweinberg equilibrium the hardyweinberg approach describes a hypothetical population that is not evolving and fulfilling the following conditions 1 absence of mutations mutations result changes in alleles insertion deletion or substitution of nucleotides result altered alleles this leads to a modified gene pool 2 occurrence of random mating breeding occurs randomly without any influence that causes selectiveness mating of closely related individuals may alter the allele frequencies 3 absence of natural selection all genotypes of the progeny are expected to survive irrespective of their differences abilities and the environmental conditions variations in survival and reproduction of some genotypes may alter the frequency of alleles 4 size of the population is extremely large in small populations particular genotypes may disappear due to death or infertility therefore larger the population more likely to favor the hardyweinberg equilibrium 5 absence of immigration or emigration individuals moving in and out of the populations may cause appearance of new genes and disappearance of existing genes this is called gene flow and it may alter allele frequencies naturally most populations do deviate from hardyweinberg equilibrium except for certain genetic loci slowly evolving populations may also do not deviate much from hardyweinberg equilibrium and therefore they remain as predicted for a nonevolving population evolution and change in gene frequency evolution can be explained in terms of changes in allele gene frequencies over generations a species evolves when changes in gene frequencies drive the species into a higher level of adaptation for a specific ecological niche genetic variation within the population is the key to evolution mutation will create new alleles and migration will include it into the population to increase variation natural selection will then choose the better adapted individuals based on their phenotypic variations causing population to evolve as a result after the evolution the population is at a higher adaptive level compared to the level of adaptation they showed before being evolved this concept can be illustrated with the evolution of the peppered moth in england during the time of industrialization the moth had two phenotypic varieties based on their colour dark and light prior to the industrialization of central england the lightcoloured allele was most prevalent the lightcolored moths had an advantage over the dark coloured ones as they could hide on the whitebarked trees to avoid predation from birds due to the pollutants generated parallel to the industrialization the lightcoloured trees were stained dark this exposed the light coloured moths to predation reducing their numbers as a result the light colour allele became less prevalent in its place the darkcolour allele became more predominant because dark moths could camouflage themselves better on the stained trees and avoid being eaten by their bird predators the population evolved to a higher adaptive state with the change in gene frequencies light colour allele frequency went down while dark colour allele frequency went up,the hardyweinberg equilibrium is a principle used to determine if a population is evolving regarding a specific genetic trait it states that in a nonevolving population allele and genotype frequencies remain constant across generations key conditions for this equilibrium include absence of mutations no changes in alleles random mating mating occurs without selective pressures absence of natural selection all genotypes survive equally large population size reduces the impact of random events on allele frequencies no immigration or emigration prevents gene flow which alters allele frequencies the principle uses the equation 2221p 22pqq 21 to predict genotype frequencies based on allele frequencies p and q an example involving a wildflower population illustrates how allele frequencies csubrsub and csubwsub lead to specific genotype ratios evolution occurs when gene frequencies change due to factors like mutations migration and natural selection exemplified by the peppered moths color adaptation during industrialization
people have intervened in the reproduction and genetic make up of plants and animals since the dawn of agriculture eight to ten thousand years ago early farmers selected the best looking plants and seeds and saved them to plant for the next season likewise the best farm animals were allowed to mate with each other to preserve and improve their desirable traits this phenomenon wherein human beings interfere in the process of reproduction to allow only selective mating to occur so that offspring with improved characters are produced is called breeding as against natural reproduction with the science of genetics became better understood plant and animal breeders used what they knew about the genes of a plant or an animal to select for specific desirable traits to develop improved plant varieties or animal breeds the selection for features such as faster growth higher yields pest and disease resistance larger seeds or sweeter fruits in crop plants colour and pattern of the skin hair or feathers in animals have now dramatically changed domesticated species compared to their wild relatives importance of plant and animal breeding in breeding programs the attributes structure and composition of plant and animals are manipulated in such a way to make them more useful to humans accordingly plant and animal breeding has a significant impact of worlds agroeconomy as discussed below 1 addressing world food and feed quality needs an estimated 800 million people in the world including 200 million children suffer from malnutrition and associated health issues plant and animal breeding helps to enhance the value of food by improving their nutritional quality for example rice which is the most widely eaten staple food lacks many essential vitamins another problem encountered in major food crops is the presence of toxic substances within them such as alkaloids in yam cyanogenic glucosides in cassava mantioc trypsin inhibitors in pulses and steroidal alkaloids in potatoes plant breeding is useful in reducing these toxic components and making them safer to eat plant breeding is also useful in making some plant products more digestible for example a high lignin content of the plant material reduces its value for animal feed which can be overcome with the use of breeding techniques 2 addressing food supply needs for a growing world population it is anticipated that an additional three billion people will be added to the world population within the next three decades aligned with this population growth an expansion in world food supply should be required to meet the projected needs unfortunately land for farming is scarce and therefore more food will have to be produced on less land this calls for improved and high yielding animal and plant varieties to be developed in response plant breeding has produced super rice which has 50 more yield compared to the normal rice super wheat which boost the harvest by 2040 of normal wheat and several high yielding corn maize and soya bean varieties the total production of meat and milk has also increased considerably over the years due to careful use of selective breeding techniques 3 need to adapt to environmental stresses weather and soil conditions can have a major impact crop yield climate changes and global warming are partly responsible for modifying the crop production environment eg some regions of the world are getting drier and others saltier to meet the increasing demand for food new cultivars need to be bred which can sustain these adverse conditions for example it is necessary to develop new plant types that can resist various biotic diseases and insect pests and other abiotic eg salt drought heat cold stresses in the production environment in response genetically modified pest resistant cotton maize and potatoes which carry bt toxin salinity tolerant rice varieties cold tolerant tobacco potato and strawberry varieties etc are now available in agricultural industry likewise both crop plants and farm animals cattle pig sheep goat etc with increased immunity to pathogens have also been produced through various breeding techniques 4 satisfying industrial and other enduse requirements consumers are having different requirements based on the texture colour and composition of a particular food item irrespective of its taste or nutritional value these diverse demands for the same food can be now successfully met through breeding procedures for example potato is a versatile crop used for food and industrial products different varieties are being developed by breeders for baking cooking fries frozen chipping and for starch these cultivars differ in size specific gravity and sugar content among other properties high sugar content is undesirable for frying or chipping because the sugar caramelizes under high heat to produce undesirable browning of fries and chips likewise there is a high demand for seedless fruits such as grapes melon and strawberries and also for leaner meat depending on these enduser requirements it is possible to develop quality added products using animal and plant breeding techniques 5 developing animal and plant varieties with aesthetic values aesthetics is of major importance in horticulture as well as in the industry of ornamental and pet animals the ornamental plant industry depends to a large extent on the development of new varieties that exhibit new flower leaf colours varying sizes and attractive shapes etc using plant breeding the pursuit of novelty has spurred a similar explosion of types in pet animals as well today selective breeding for numerous morphological features and functional abilities have given rise to nearly 400 dog breeds making them one of the most diversified species on earth likewise there are close to 50 rabbit breeds vast number of bird varieties and an extensive range of ornamental fish,human intervention in the reproduction of plants and animals known as breeding has been practiced for thousands of years to enhance desirable traits this has evolved with genetic understanding enabling breeders to select specific attributes for improved species key aspects of plant and animal breeding include nutritional improvement enhances food quality by increasing nutritional value and reducing toxins in crops food supply addresses the needs of a growing population by developing highyield varieties such as super rice and wheat environmental adaptation breeding new cultivars that withstand adverse conditions like drought and salinity industrial demand meets consumer preferences for texture and composition creating diverse food products aesthetic values in horticulture and pet industries breeding leads to new ornamental plants and diverse animal breeds breeding significantly impacts agriculture addressing food security and environmental challenges while fulfilling consumer demands
plant and animal breeders use numerous techniques to create new varieties with enhanced features many of these techniques have been successfully practiced over centuries even without the knowledge of the underlying genetics following section summarizes some of these traditional breeding techniques which has caused significant improvements in agriculture and farming i artificial selection artificial selection is the earliest form of biotechnology and has been used by humans for thousands of years it is a process of selective breeding where plants or animals with specific traits were selected to breed so that their desired traits could be passed to the next generations to produce a high performing new variety the method has made a huge impact on agriculture by way of improving plant and animal products before the discovery of more sophisticated technologies like genetic engineering the first prerequisite of artificial selection is the availability of variation with respect to the desirable characters once a population with a desirable variation is recognized the best performing individuals for the desired feature are selected for example when selecting for fruit size in plants only those giving the biggest fruits are chosen for the breeding program and the rest of the population is discarded or rejected the progeny of the selected individuals is grown further and again screened for the desired feature this process is repeated sometimes for many generations until a uniform plant population is attained which has the bestdesired characters eventually a new uniform crop variety with the desired characteristic is produced by this successive selection followed by multiplication of the selected individuals the advantage of selective breeding is that it uses the processes of natural selection but under direct supervision from carefully selected animals or plants with the desired traits there are no genetic modifications or other forms of tampering that could potentially harm people and the risk to the plant or animal is often minimum crops like corn and wheat are commonly selectively bred in order to obtain the highest yielding plants breeding animals with higher protein and lower fat percentages as well as plants that have higher nutritional values had been used to create food sources with a higher quality of nutrition in addition selective breeding has effectively removed undesirable traits such as low resistance to disease in some animals and plants however selective breeding among animals can take a long time for the process to work in horse breeding for example the given standard to establish a new breed is to have offspring with the desired traits to be produced over the course of 7 generations this means it may take 2550 years for the desired traits to become a foundational component of an animal 2 inbreeding and out breeding i inbreeding the breeding among genetically similar individuals are known as inbreeding among plant breeders the term inbreeding is commonly used to mean selffertilization le the fertilization of a flower with its own pollen or with pollen from a different flower on the same plant this is done to produce an inbred variety which is exactly the same generation after generation many important crops such as wheat oats barley and tobacco are produced from seeds which are habitually selffertilized however in animal breeding the term inbreeding is used to refer to the mating of closely related individuals as for instance the mating of father and daughter brother and sister or cousins in both crop plants and farm animals inbreeding brings uniformity of the required type while preserving the desired characters inbreeding is used for developing pure lines in agriculture as well as for research as a rule inbreeding increases homozygosis and thus exposes harmful recessive genes which would have otherwise stay hidden among heterozygotes continued inbreeding therefore reduces genetic fitness of the population as a result the growth and fertility of the inbred population would go down with adverse effect on their productivity prevalence of genetic disorders might also increase among the inbred population this phenomenon of having a reduced genetic fitness in a given population as a result of inbreeding is called inbreeding depression however in agriculture and animal husbandry positive effects of inbreeding will be harnessed as much as possible to ensure this only those offspring that are exhibiting the desired trait without other negative ones will be used for future breeding the negatively affected individuals in the progeny are removed or are not be allowed to be bred thus inbreeding is used in agriculture to help accumulation of superior genes ii outbreeding when plants or animals of different breeds races are mated with each other it is known as outbreeding or cross breeding this allows the desirable characters of the exotic parent which the indigenous parent does not have to be transmitted to the progeny for example cross breeding is carried out by animal breeders to enhance milk and meat production in india zebu breeds of cows and nondescript cows are crossed with exotic breeds like holstein fresian brown swiss and jersey bulls or their semen to enhance the milk production potential of the progeny likewise crop plants like corn and hemp are normally crossfertilized 3 hybrid breeding when genetically unrelated purebred plants or animals in the same species are mated with each other it is known as hybridization or outcrossing generally this is carried out with plants and animals who do not share common ancestors on either side of their pedigree up to four to six generations the offspring of such a mating is known as the out cross and will possess stable characteristics and hybrid vigour hybrid vigour also called heterosis is the increase in such characteristics as size growth rate fertility and yield in the hybrid organism over those of its parents plant and animal breeders exploit heterosis by mating two different purebred lines that have certain desirable traits the firstgeneration offspring generally show in greater measure the desired characteristics of both parents this vigour may decrease however if the hybrids are mated together so the parental lines must be maintained and crossed for each new crop or group desired in plant breeding because creating hybrids involves many years of preparation to create pure lines that have to be constantly maintained so that f hybrid seeds can be harvested each year the seeds then become more expensive nevertheless hybrid seeds have had a tremendous impact on agricultural productivity today nearly all corn and 50 of all rice are hybrids in the us the widespread use of corn hybrids coupled with improved cultural practices by farmers has more than tripled corn grain yields over the past 50 years from an average of 35 bushels per acre in the 1930s to 115 bushels per acre in the 1990s no other major crop anywhere in the world even comes close to equaling that sort of success story many cultivars of popular vegetables or ornamental plants are hybrids in terms of improved plant characteristics tropical vegetable breeders can point to some rather clear achievements over the last two decades yield improvement hybrids often out yield traditional true breeding varieties inbred varieties by 50100 due to its improved vigor improved genetic disease resistance improved fruit setting under stress and higher femalemale flower ratios extended growing season hybrids often mature up to 15 days earlier than local true breeding varieties for many crops the hybrids relative advantage over the true breeding is most pronounced under stress conditions quality improvement hybrids have helped stabilize product quality at a higher and more uniform level this implies improved consumption quality eg firm flesh of wax gourd crispy taste of watermelon 4 interspecific breeding in this approach which is also known as interspecific hybridization male and female organisms of two different species are mated the progeny obtained from such a mating are usually different from both the parental species and may be fertile partially fertile or sterile plants hybridize much more frequently and successfully than animals do pollen from flowering plants disperses widely and may land on flowers of other species allowing natural interspecific breeding to take place plant forms are less stringently controlled than animal forms and so the intermediate form of a plant hybrid is more likely to be physiologically successful often interspecific hybrids are sterile or for some other reason cannot interbreed with the parental species occasionally sterile interspecific hybrids can undergo a doubling of their chromosome set and become fertile tetraploids four sets of chromosomes for example the bread wheats that humans use today are a result of two hybridizations each followed by chromosome doubling to produce fertile hexaploids six sets of chromosomes in such instances the hybrids can become new species with characteristics different from either of the parents crop yields increase dramatically when hybridization is used to exceed one or more of the parents in size and reproductive potential for example boysenberries rubus ursinus x idaeus were developed at knotts berry farm in california they are a result of a set of crosses between blackberries rubus fruticosus european raspberries rubus idaeus and loganberries rubus loganobaccus for many fruit crop species the use of interspecific breeding is increasing in order to utilize naturally occurring sources of pest and disease resistance fruitquality components etc within the available germ plasm for example winter hardiness of apple was improved by making a hybrid species malus x domestica from malus asiatica and malus pumifolia however among animals interspecific breeding is restricted to few species common examples include mule male donkey x female horse hinny male horse x female donkey and liger male lion x female tiger note that in mules and hinnies the common genus the parents belong to is equus and liger its panthera other examples are zebradonkey cross resulting in an offspring called zonkey zebra horse cross resulting in zorse the offspring from this cross could develop into adults but may not develop functional gametes sterility is often attributed to the different number of chromosomes the two species have for example donkeys have 62 chromosomes horses have 64 chromosomes,plant and animal breeders employ various traditional techniques to create new varieties with enhanced traits significantly improving agriculture key methods include artificial selection the process of selectively breeding individuals with desired traits leading to highperforming varieties over generations this method relies on existing genetic variation without genetic modifications inbreeding mating closely related individuals to create uniform varieties often leading to reduced genetic fitness and increased recessive disorders a phenomenon known as inbreeding depression outbreeding crossing different breeds to introduce desirable traits from one to another enhancing production traits such as milk yield in cattle hybrid breeding crossing genetically unrelated purebred plants or animals resulting in hybrids with increased vigor and productivity termed heterosis interspecific breeding mating individuals from different species which may produce hybrids with unique characteristics this approach is more common in plants than in animals due to physiological compatibility these techniques demonstrate the blend of art and science in breeding practices that have shaped modern agriculture
from the beginning of plant and animal breeding farmers made use of principles of genetics with or without awareness of these concepts following section explains three most widely used genetic principles applied in animal and plant breeding at present 1 polyploidy polyploidy refers to the presence of more than two complete sets of homologous chromosomes per cell nucleus this is a widely used principle in plant breeding in plants polyploidy can be induced artificially using antimitotic agent colchicine one of the most important consequences of polyploidy for plant breeding are the increment in plant organs gigas effect caused by the larger number of gene copies polyploid individuals may thus exhibit larger organs compared to their diploid counterparts such as roots leaves tubers fruits flowers and seeds polyploid plants also have lower growth rates and tend to flower later or over a longer period of time than related diploids which is a desirable feature for ornamental breeding in addition polyploidy often results in reduced fertility due to meiotic errors allowing the production of seedless varieties such as the triploid watermelon on the other hand when the crossing between two species is not possible because of differences in ploidy level polyploids can be used as a bridge for gene transferring between them similarly the genome doubling in a newly formed sterile hybrid allows the restoration of its fertility genome redundancy having additional gene copies due to increase ploidy have other benefits as well it promotes a buffering effect in which the deleterious alleles are masked by the extra copies of wildtype alleles at the same time it allows functional diversification of redundant gene copies in which one member of a duplicated gene pair mutates and acquires a novel function without compromising essential functions the increment in heterozygosity is another feature that accompanies polyploidy higher levels of heterozygosity have been positively related to vigor increment in maize potato and alfalfa improving the product quality and increasing the tolerance to both biotic and abiotic stresses 2 mutation breeding methods for inducing mutation have the potential of producing new sources of genetic variability for crop breeding these methods can be employed when it appears there is little or no variability for the character to be improved available within the gene pool of the species this method of inducing desirable mutations in crop plants using either chemical or physical agents was termed mutation breeding several agents can be used to cause mutations this include ionizing radiation such as gamma rays protons neutrons alpha and beta particles and chemicals such as sodium azide and ethyl methane sulphonate since the desirable mutations induced by these treatments are found at a very low frequency 01 of total mutations breeders have to screen a large population to select a desirable mutation in addition most mutations act in a recessive fashion and are likely to be masked by their dominant allelic counterparts making the screening procedure even harder the effectiveness of using induced mutation depends on the breeding system of the plant its use in selfpollinated plants is likely to be more successful than in crosspollinated ones populations of crosspollinated plants usually possess stores of genetic variability in the recessive condition and it would not be likely that induced mutation would produce significant amounts of new variability further induced mutation is potentially useful in the improvement of asexually propagated crop plants despite these limitations mutation breeding efforts continue around the world today it has improved both morphological and physiological characteristic of both crop and ornamental plants such as flower colours seed size crop yield disease resistance and salinity tolerance drought tolerance and early maturity examples of plants that have been produced via mutation breeding include wheat barley rice potatoes soybeans and onions 3 genetic modification genetic modification also called genetic engineering is the direct manipulation of an organisms genes to change the genetic makeup of cells in this method genetic material is obtained from one organism showing a desired trait and will be inserted to another second organism using recombinant dna technology so that the receiving organism will also show the same desirable trait thus by transferring genes within and across species improved or novel organisms are produced in traditional plant breeding techniques transfer of genes is limited to the closely related species or genera for example traditional breeding techniques could not be used to insert a desired gene from daffodil into rice because the many intermediate species between rice and daffodil and their common ancestor is extinct with genetic engineering however such gene transfers can be done more quickly more specifically and without the need for intermediate species the term transgenic organism or genetically modified organism gmo is used to describe organisms that have been engineered to express a gene from another species advocates for plant biotechnology believe that the genetic engineering of crop plants is the key to overcoming some of the most pressing problems of the 21st century including world hunger and fossil fuel dependency examples of transgenic plant varieties include transgenic papaya that is resistant to ring spot virus golden rice with increased levels of betacarotene and salinity resistant rice varieties among others natural or artificial breeding advantages and disadvantages although artificial breeding is extensively practiced today with remarkable economic gains there are serval drawbacks in the method in comparison to the natural breeding the artificial breeding is geared towards producing a uniform set of plants or animals with traits desirable to humans the development of this uniformity needs compromising the variability within the species this reduction of genetic diversity will have adverse consequences on the evolutionary fitness of the species leading to low resistance to infections higher prevalence of congenital anomalies and reduced fertility for example when a population of animals or plants with the same genetic traits are attacked by a pathogen to which they are susceptible the entire population is likely suffer due to the absence of the resistant trait within the gene pool this limited opportunities for the natural selection to act upon the population is likely to drive them towards a lower fitness plateau on the other hand natural breeding can rule out weaknesses and disabilities which affect survival by allowing natural selection to act upon the species this will produce fitter and stronger individuals in the long run however the natural selection would not guarantee a productivity increase in the consumer perspective despite the increase in genetic fitness as discussed earlier sometimes inbreeding is practiced as an artificial breeding technique this would result in an increase in homozygosis which would in turn increase the expression of recessive deleterious mutations that would otherwise stay masked within heterozygotes this can cause the population to undergo inbreeding depression with adverse effects on the overall fitness sometimes artificial breeding can exhibit negative correlated responses this refers to the fact that while artificial breeding is improving certain characters in the population simultaneously and unintendedly it could lead towards deterioration of other characters that are not under direct observation for example the shape of the skull in some dog breeds has made it difficult for them to eat normal food because of the upper jaw being much shorter than the lower jaw such as in the case of boxer or the bulldog likewise selection for large offspring has resulted in a high fraction of difficult births sometimes requiring caesarean sections in the texel sheep and even almost as a standard way of delivering in the beef cattle breeds belgian whiteandblue cattle and the dutch improved redandwhite this kind of negative responses are difficult to predict in advance and usually only visible after the new breed is established although there are negative impacts artificial breeding is still preferred over natural breeding for the numerous advantages it could bestow upon overall animal and plant productivity as discussed earlier,farmers have utilized genetic principles in animal and plant breeding consciously or not three key principles are polyploidy this is the presence of more than two complete sets of chromosomes in a cell often induced using colchicine polyploid plants tend to have larger organs and may produce seedless varieties such as triploid watermelons they also exhibit increased heterozygosity which can enhance vigor and stress tolerance mutation breeding this method involves inducing mutations through chemicals or radiation to create genetic diversity when natural variation is low although successful mainly in selfpollinated species it has improved various traits in crops like wheat and rice genetic modification also known as genetic engineering this process alters an organisms genes to express desired traits by transferring genes across species it enables faster and more specific changes compared to traditional breeding methods despite advantages like improved productivity artificial breeding can reduce genetic diversity and lead to issues like inbreeding depression and unintended negative traits
nucleic acids are capable in directing their own replication from their monomers in most organisms dna is found as the genetic material however some viruses such as influenza virus consist rna as their genetic material accurate replication of dna its transmission from one generation to the other and its ability to store and express hereditary information facilitates dna for acting as vital genetic material in organisms dna double helix model james watson and francis crick based on the xray crystallography of a dna molecule obtained by rosalind franklin proposed the double helix model to describe how the six molecules deoxy ribose sugar phosphate group and four different nitrogenous bases are organized into dna and explain its properties according to this model dna is a twisted ladder spiral staircase in which the rails are composed of alternating phosphate and sugar molecules forming the back bone the steps of the ladder are paired nitrogenous bases a purine is paired with a pyrimidine as per the base pairing rule with either two hydrogen bonds at or three g c th morgan and his group through their experiments concluded that chromosomes are made up of dna and proteins and genes as regions of chromosomes architecture of chromosomes architecture of chromosomes is the way the dna molecules are arranged in the nucleoid or nuclear region of the cytoplasm of the prokaryotic cells or in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells na of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes are called chromosomes however true chromosomes are present only in eukaryotes prokaryotic bacterial chromosome is a single double stranded circular dna molecule associated with a few protein molecules eukaryotes have several chromosomes each consisting of a single double stranded linear dna associated with histones and other protein molecules when the size of all chromosomes of an organism are considered it is an enormous amount of dna these facts illustrate that a cell has a huge problem in having its dna either in the nucleoid of prokaryotes or the nucleus of eukaryotes the containment of the genomedna in the nucleoid or in the nucleus is called dna packaging architecture of prokaryotic chromosomes packaging of dna in prokaryotes is facilitated by the proteins associated with the dna molecule the protein molecules cause the dna to coil or fold or loop and supercoil so the dna molecule is compacted into the nucleoid the dna molecule is initially coiled into loops and these loops then independently supercoil into domains identifiable in electron micrographs the loops of compacted mass of dna are bound to a core consisting of rna and protein the core also attaches the chromosome to the membrane the supercoiled dna can be relaxed by introducing single strand nicks since the chromosomes are attached to the membrane and held together by the core acting as a barrier for rotation the domains can relax and supercoil independently this is important in the transcription of specific genes removal of rna will lead to loss of independence of the loops in addition to the chromosomal dna certain prokaryotes have extra chromosomal genetic elements called plasmids they are also circular dna and are coiled and supercoiled architecture of eukaryotic chromosomes eukaryotic chromosomes are associated with a large number of proteins called histones that helps to organize the dna inside the nucleus this dnaprotein complex is known as chromatin the chromatin may be lightly packed as in euchromatin or tightly packed as in heterochromatin euchromatin is rich in genes and is probably active in transcription heterochromatin consists nucleotide sequences which are mostly inactive they may contribute in gene regulation epigenetic inheritance and protection of chromosomal integrity in the first level the double helix winds around a complex of eight histone molecules these are called nucleosomes and they look like beads of a necklace the adjoining beads of nucleosomes are linked together by a stretch of dna linker dna in the second level the nucleosomes twist and pack in a spiral fashion to form a chromatin fiber of roughly 30 nm in diameter30 nm fibers from 10 nm fibers at the third level the 30 nm fiber forms loops called looped domains attached to a protein scaffold this structure has a thickness of 300 nm figure 75 finally at the fourth level the looped domains coil fold and further compact to form the mitotic chromosome the diameter of a chromatid is about 700 nm in the metaphase chromosome the chromatids are already replicated,nucleic acids primarily dna are crucial for genetic information storage and replication in organisms dnas double helix structure proposed by watson and crick consists of deoxyribose sugar phosphate groups and four nitrogenous bases chromosomes the organized dna structures differ in prokaryotes and eukaryotes prokaryotic chromosomes single circular dna molecule coiled and supercoiled compacted in the nucleoid with associated proteins eukaryotic chromosomes linear dna wrapped around histones to form nucleosomes resulting in chromatin which can be euchromatin active in transcription or heterochromatin mostly inactive dna packaging in eukaryotes involves multiple levels of coiling and folding leading to compact mitotic chromosomes during cell division
this is the process which copies a double stranded dna molecule to produce two identical copies because dna replication process is basically similar in prokaryotes and eukaryotes however there are differences in enzymes involved this is because the eukaryotic nuclear dna is organized into chromosomes and contain histones in their structure for packaging and the prokaryotic dna are usually found as circular molecules which are supercoiled for packaging importance of dna replication e the essential information for life is stored in dna therefore the new cells produced must receive the dna from their parent cells as each cell in the body of a diploid organism should contain the same genetic information as was in the zygote a multicellular organism grows by addition of new cells e damaged or dead cells are also replaced by new cells e in asexual reproduction the offspring is identical to the parent cell this is possible only because dna has the ability to replicate and provide an identical set of genetic information stored in dna to each daughter cell by mitosis e in sexually reproducing organisms meiosis occurs at some point of life cycle in order to maintain a constant number of chromosomes dna replication occurs prior to meiosis e dna replication is a very accurate process so that it makes identical copies however rare errors occur in dna replication introducing mutations which results in variation variation leads to evolution of organisms e therefore dna replication is important in maintenance of the life of an individual organism and continuation of a species the process of dna replication in prokaryotes the entire replication process is carefully controlled and coordinated by a number of enzymes and other proteins dna is synthesized on the existing dna strands of the double helix of the dna molecule the parent dna strands are used as the templates thus the newly synthesized dna double helix contains one parent dna strand and a new complimentary strand first of all the tightly packed dna supercoiled dna in prokaryotes and chromatin in eukaryotes has to relax so that the dna replication machinery can have access to the place where the replication begins the separation of the double helix occurs at the origin of replication origin of replication or ori is a specific sequence of dna to which proteins that initiate dna replication bind starting from this the entire circular dna is replicated on both directions since the enzyme synthesizing the new dna strand can move only in one direction 5 to 3 direction one of the new strands can be synthesized continuously while the other will be synthesized as small fragments the small fragments of lagging strand are called okazaki fragments these are called leading and lagging strands respectively replication of large dna molecules may begin at several origins of replication to speed up the process functions of major enzymes and other proteins of replication machinery a number of enzymes and other proteins are required in the replication of dna these proteins assemble at the origin of replication the major enzymes involved in the dna replication are helicase topoisomerase primase dna polymerases and dna ligase there are several other proteins in the replication machinery including single strand binding ssb proteins helicase these are the enzymes that unwind the double helix and separate the two strands of a dna molecule with the expense of energy as atp the separation occurs by breaking hydrogen bonds between the base pairs of the two strands this is important for exposing the two strands to function as template for new dna synthesis replication topoisomerase these enzymes are working ahead of the direction of dna synthesis the untwisting of the strands at one place causes further twisting and strain on other places topoisomerase enzymes introduce breaks on one or both strands of dna twist the molecule to relieve the strain and then reseal the cut ends single strand binding proteins ssb these protein molecules bind to exposed single stranded dna to prevent repairing of the separated dna strands and to stabilize them if the two strands repair then they cannot serve as templates for new dna synthesis primase in order to synthesize a new dna strand on a template complementary deoxyribonucleotides should be added one after the other in the correct sequence this is done by dna polymerase but dna polymerases can add nucleotides only to the 3 end of an already formed nucleic acid chain for this a small fragment of nucleic acid chain is sufficient and this fragment is called a primer primase is a type of rna polymerase which can initiate synthesis of rna on a dna template by adding ribonucleotides primase adds a short rna primer on the dna template forming dnarna hybrid to facilitate the action of dna polymerase dna polymerases there are several types of dna polymerases one type of dna polymerase initiates dna polymerization by adding a deoxyribonucleotide to the 3 end of a primer and continues polymerization on 5 to 3 direction elongating the new dna strand with deoxyribonucleotides with bases complementary to template his dna polymerase is almost 100 errorfree in adding correct complementary nucleotides to growing strand according to the nucleotide sequence of the parent dna strands however one error in 10 added nucleotides is possible has a proofreading mechanism and therefore can correct its own mistakes and the error rate will be reduced by 100000 times to one in 10 therefore the daughter dna molecules are almost identical to the parent dna molecule and of course to each other when a wrong nucleotide is added to the growing chain of dna by dna polymerase this mismatch is identified by the same enzyme stops adding the next nucleotide removes the incorrect nucleotide by exonuclease activity and continues again its polymerase activity this is called as proofreading activity of dna polymerase another type of dna polymerase identifies dnarna hybrid removes ribonucleotides and replaces those with deoxyribonucleotides and so replaces the rna primer with dna now the replication of the dna segment is complete but the dna polymerase unable to connect the ends of okazaki fragments results gaps dna ligase in dna synthesis it joins the newly synthesized adjacent fragments making a complete strand by the formation of a phosphodiester bond it seals the gaps of the newly synthesized dna strand,dna replication is the process that copies a doublestranded dna molecule to produce two identical copies vital for cell division and genetic continuity in organisms while similar in prokaryotes and eukaryotes they differ in the enzymes used due to their dna organizationcircular in prokaryotes and linear in eukaryotes importance of dna replication ensures genetic information is passed to new cells replaces damaged or dead cells facilitates asexual reproduction producing identical offspring prepares for meiosis in sexually reproducing organisms introduces rare mutations that contribute to evolution prokaryotic dna replication process dna unwinding at the origin of replication initiated by helicase the strands are stabilized by single strand binding proteins primase synthesizes an rna primer for dna polymerase to begin replication dna polymerases add nucleotides in a 5 to 3 direction leading and lagging strands are formed dna ligase connects okazaki fragments on the lagging strand major enzymes and proteins helicase unwinds the double helix topoisomerase relieves strain during unwinding single strand binding proteins ssb stabilize separated strands primase creates rna primers dna polymerases synthesizes new dna strands and proofreads for accuracy dna ligase joins okazaki fragments
eukaryotes share many characteristics of dna replication of the prokaryotes they also use helicase to unwind the dsdna and use dna polymerases for the polymerization reaction the replication is originated in both types at specific sequences origin of replication ori to initiate dna replication packed dna is relaxed with topoisomerase and replication process move in the same manner and therefore having leading and lagging strand rna primers are formed and replaced the gaps are sealed by dna ligase although the process is superficially similar there are several significant differences too the size of the dna molecule in a eukaryotic chromosome is much larger than that of a circular dna molecule of a bacterium therefore prokaryotes usually have one ori while an eukaryotic chromosome has several ori the dna polymerases in eukaryotes and prokaryotes are different from each other in their structure while having the same functions the dna replication of the prokaryotes occurs continuously whereas in eukaryotes it happens only in the sphase of cell cycle dna repair and its significance damage to dna can be caused by various chemical and physical agents introducing mismatches in dna double helix and may lead to a permanent change in the sequence of dna this may also be caused by errors in dna replication that goes unnoticed by proofreading this is called mutation a mutation or collection of mutations can make a cell malignant and result in a cancer mutations also alter the phenotype and very often they are either lethal or at least produce unfavorable phenotypes when the mutations occur in cells producing gametes they may be passed onto the next generations resulting in variations among offspring when such a mismatch is there the shape of the double helix is distorted for example uv radiation can covalently link two adjacent thymine bases distorting the dna molecule one of the two copies of dna molecules generated by these distorted sequences carries a permanent change in the sequence a mutation such distorted locations are usually recognized and repaired by the dna repair mechanism of the cell before it becomes permanent and that reduces the risk of accumulation of mutations because dna repair is very important for the survival of organisms a large number of dna repairing enzymes are found in various organisms such enzymes may cut off the mismatched sequences in the damaged strand and replace with correct nucleotides the cutting excision is done by a nuclease and filling the gap using the correct strand as the template is done by a type of dna polymerase this is called nucleotide excision repair dna ligase completes the dna strand by sealing it with a phosphodiester bond genes and how they work the nature of prokaryotic and eukaryotic genes when gregor mendel put forward his laws of inheritance in 1860 he used the term hereditary factors to explain what control the characters shown in a phenotype and which are transmitted from generation to generation at that time these were imaginary units and where they were located in cellular structure was not known today these physical and functional units of heredity have been identified as genes that are located on chromosomes as discrete units this disclosure began with the development of cytology and the ability to observe the behavior of chromosomes in mitosis and meiosis behavior of chromosomes and the behavior of the mendels hereditary factors show the same pattern in eukaryotes chromosomes occur in pairs in diploid somatic cells and hence genes also occur in pairs a pair of chromosomes coming from the two parents containing the same genes is called homologous chromosomes generally prokaryotes have one chromosome in each cell and hence may be considered haploid the location or the site of a gene on the chromosome is called a locus loci in plural the alteration versions of genes that are located at the same locus on different chromosomes are called alleles of the genes prokaryotic genes are housed in loci on the circular dna molecule as discrete segments of dna there are many steps in a biochemical pathway and each step is controlled by a gene and therefore many genes are involved in controlling a particular phenotype in eukaryotes these genes are scattered among several chromosomes while in prokaryotes they are arranged in the same region of the chromosome one after the other as clusters these clusters are expressed together by a single control region and are transcribed into one mrna such mrna molecules will be translated into several different polypeptides with respect to the genes of the dna template these organized gene clusters in prokaryotes are called operons operon a group of genes that functions as a single transcription unit it is an operator a promoter and structural genes that are transcribed into one mrna coding for several peptides comprised of a control region in prokaryotes all dna segments in the chromosome are functional either transcribed into mrna or act as control regions while in eukaryotes a large proportion of dna has no identified function such dna segments that are present in between the genes are referred to as intergenic dna there are also sequences within the genes that are transcribed but are not translated into polypeptides that means there are coding sequences as well as noncoding sequences in the transcript of the gene the noncoding sequences within the genes are called introns while the sequences that code for polypeptides are exons accordingly the transcript contains exons as well as introns the transcript is a premrna and it undergoes processing where introns are excised and exons are joined in order to produce mrna,eukaryotic and prokaryotic dna replication share several similarities such as the use of helicase to unwind dna and dna polymerases for synthesis however there are key differences origins of replication ori prokaryotes typically have one ori while eukaryotic chromosomes contain multiple structure of dna polymerases they differ structurally between eukaryotes and prokaryotes replication timing prokaryotic replication is continuous while eukaryotic replication occurs only during the sphase of the cell cycle dna repair is crucial for correcting damage caused by environmental factors or replication errors preventing mutations that could lead to cancer this involves nucleotide excision repair enzymes cut out damaged sections and replace them using the undamaged strand as a template genes the units of heredity are located on chromosomes in eukaryotes genes occur in pairs on homologous chromosomes while prokaryotic genes are clustered in operons which are groups of genes transcribed together
evidences collected in genetic studies were noted by scientists and several of them independently developed chromosome theory of inheritance the mendelian hereditary factors or genes are located on the chromosomes at specific loci therefore chromosomes and genes housed on them occur in pairs in diploid cells the aligning of homologous chromosomes in metaphase i occurs at random and therefore this is independent assortment ie no order in arranging maternal and paternal chromosomes in anaphase i the independently assorted homologous chromosomes separate reducing the number of chromosomes to half this is segregation with the independent assortment and segregation of chromosomes alleles of genes on nonhomologous chromosomes are assorted independently in different combinations in metaphase i the alleles segregate after completion of anaphase 1 to form four haploid cells having different allele combinations in equal proportions the same reasoning can explain the phenotypic ratios observed by mendel in f generation after random crossing of f gene expression genes control characters when a gene is at work and it is said that the gene is expressed gene expression is the process by which the information stored in a gene is used to make a functional gene product the final product of a gene is usually a polypeptide which after suitable modifications becomes a protein however several rnas also function as final gene products for example ribosomal rna rrna and transfer rna trna are such rna molecules having direct functions in examining how genes control characters it was revealed that the first suggestion came in 1902 from archibald garrod inherited diseases are caused by the inability to produce related enzymes as a result of inborn errors in metabolism the symptoms of a hereditary disease condition known as alkaptonuria is due to inability to make the metabolic enzyme which metabolizes the chemical alkapton in patients alkapton remains in urea and its oxidation results in black coloration of urine the gene expression begins by copying the the term copying is used in transcription as in linguistics since the information written in the nucleotide sequence of dna by four letters agct is copied to the same chemical language as a nucleotide sequence of rna written in four letters agcu with only difference that t is replaced by u the amino acid sequence in the polypeptide chain is also linear and parallel to the base sequence in the gene or mrna but the chemical languages are different language written in four letters to a language written in 20 letters this is information stored in a segment of dna or a gene e reason why the second step is called translation into sequence of rna in synthesis of polypeptide the gene is not directly converted into polypeptide but involves an rna molecule to pass the message in dna to a message in polypeptide since the rna molecule acts as a messenger to communicate the information from dna to polypeptide it is called messenger rna mrna the two steps in polypeptide synthesis are 1 transcription copying a sequence of dna into mrna 2 translation converting the information in mrna to a sequence of amino acids transcription is similar to replication since a dna strand is acting as a template to make a complementary mrna strand the difference in transcription is that the copy isa mrna molecule and only one dna strand is copied the major enzyme catalyzing polymerization is named as rna polymerase this is mrna because it transmits the message stored in the gene to the place where the polypeptide chain is actually being assembled message in mrna is translated to a sequence of amino acids this process occurs in association with ribosomes which are present in the cytosol in addition to mrna other types of rnas and enzymes are involved in the polypeptide synthesis the basic mechanism of the process of polypeptide synthesis is similar in prokaryotes and eukaryotes with some important differences genetic code in transcription each letter of the template will be copied to the corresponding letter in mrna note that the mrna is complementary to template and hence it is a copy of the other dna strand this seems to be straight forward one to one copying on the other hand language of nucleic acid has four letters nucleotides whereas the language of protein has 20 letters amino acids if each kind of nucleotide is translated into amino acid only four amino acids would be specified or coded therefore a combination of nucleotides would be needed to code for one amino acid it has been proven by experiment that amino acids are coded by triplets of nucleotide bases and the protein synthesis is based on a triplet code therefore the genetic code is a triplet code if threeletter combinations or triplets are considered 4 64 possibilities are there the three letter words or triplets are read one after the other and hence are nonoverlapping since all the words have three letters no space is required to delimit the words the genetic code stored in a gene in nonoverlapping threeletter word is copied to nonoverlapping threeletter word in complementary mrna this is translated by reading three letters at a time identifying an amino acid corresponding to each threeletter word figure 716 the triplet of nucleotide bases of mrna either coding for an amino acid or a termination signal is called a codon therefore the genetic code has 64 codons out of 64 61 triplets code for 20 amino acids and the other three are used to signal the stop of translation or as termination codons uaa uag and uga aug codon codes for methionine met as start codon signaling the protein synthesizing machinery to start translation of mrna at that codon therefore the first amino acid of all protein is methionine but this may be enzymatically removed after the translation figure 716 shows all 64 codons and what each of them codes for it is easily noticeable that certain amino acids are coded by more than one codon to read a message accurately a starting point and a termination point as well as correct sequence of letters should be identified this is called a reading frame the protein synthesizing machinery starts and ends reading at precise positions and reads triplets one after the other in a nonoverlapping fashion since all words are three letter ones no spaces between words are required if the reading starts at a wrong place entirely wrong message will be read and a wrong polypeptide will be synthesized if one letter is missing or one letter is added in the reading frame the wrong message will be read from that point onwards once again making a wrong polypeptide if at all the reading of the message is always from left to right by convention another interesting feature of the genetic code is that its universality this means nearly all organisms share the same genetic code accordingly a gene isolated from one organism and inserted in to another related or nonrelated organism should express the same protein this is how human insulin is produced by bacteria the reading frame for insulin protein will be translated in exactly the same way in both human and bacterial cells a firefly gene can be expressed in tobacco plant so that the plant emits light,the chromosome theory of inheritance posits that genes are located on chromosomes which exist in pairs in diploid cells during meiosis homologous chromosomes align randomly in metaphase i leading to independent assortment followed by segregation in anaphase i which reduces the chromosome number by half this results in haploid cells that contain various allele combinations gene expression involves two critical processes transcription the copying of dna into messenger rna mrna where the dna sequence is translated into a complementary rna sequence translation the conversion of the mrna sequence into a polypeptide protein chain the genetic code comprises triplets of nucleotide bases known as codons with 64 combinations coding for 20 amino acids the start codon aug indicates the beginning of translation while three termination codons signal the end of the process a key feature of the genetic code is its universality allowing genes from one organism to be expressed in another exemplified by the production of human insulin in bacteria
i transcription transcription is dna directed rna synthesis this is completed in three steps 1 initiation the process of transcription is initiated at a specific site called promoter the promoter site includes a transcription initiation site and several other nucleotides only one strand of the double stranded dna acts as a template for transcription this is because only the template strand will have the promoter sequence in the correct orientation which facilitates the binding of rna polymerase the enzyme polymerizing the rna is rna polymerase this enzyme binds to the promoter site in correct orientation the rna polymerase then unwinds the two dna strands and begins the transcription at start point a component of rna polymerase has the helicase activity and hence dna helicase is not involved in transcription 2 elongation rna polymerase enzymes can start adding complementary ribonucleotides against the template dna rna polymerase continues to add nucleotides in 5 to 3 direction until it reaches the transcription termination site the dna strands unwinds as the rna polymerase moves forward exposing template dna and allowing pairing with ribonucleotide the two strands rewind at the other end 3 termination in prokaryotes the polymerization continues passing the termination sequence of dna and rna polymerase enzyme falls off ending the transcription after termination the newly synthesized pre mrna in eukaryotes is subjected to rna processing the mature rna leaves the nucleus ii translation once the mrna is in the cytosol translation process is initiated ribosomes read the message written as a sequence of triplet codons in an mrna and translate it into a sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide with the assistance of transfer rnas trna a trna attached to the correct amino acid from a pool in the cytosol transports it to the ribosome which adds the amino acid to the growing end of the polypeptide chain by making a peptide bond the key players in translation are trnas a specific trna molecule binds a specific amino acid to its one end its structure also carries at a specific location a triplet of nucleotides which is complementary to the codon in the mrna that code for the amino acid it carries this triplet is known as anticodon and it can basepair with the codon figure 718 this is how trna does the translation by acting as an adapter molecule between the triplet codon and the amino acid specified by it process of translation the translation is also completed in three stages 1 initiation the first step in initiation is binding of small subunit of ribosome to mrna and to the initiator trna which carries methionine as the first amino acid then the two subunits of the ribosome combine to form the functional ribosome this complex of ribosomal subunits mrna and initiator trna is called translation initiation complex figure 720 then the mrna moves until the aug start codon aligns with the p site of the large subunit then the anticodon of the initiator trna forms hydrogen bonds with aug start codon this signals the initiation of the translation 2 elongation in this stage amino acids are added to the c terminus of the growing polypeptide chain by peptide bonds one after the other governed by the triplet codons elongation is completed by a threestep cycle at the end of the initiation stage p site is occupied with trna attached to methionine and a site is empty and is aligned with the next codon the second trna charged with the corresponding amino acid is brought to the a site matching the codon and anticodon this first step in the cycle is the codon recognition as the second step a peptide bond is formed between the carboxy group of the growing polypeptide chain in the p site with the amino group of the amino acid in the a site an rrna catalyzes this reaction the third step is the translocation of the mrna the mrna moves codon by codon unidirectionally in the process the trna with the growing polypeptide chain in the a site is moved to the p site the released trna in the p site will move simultaneously to the e site from where it is released to the cytosol the a site is now aligned with the next codon so that this cyclic process can continue gtp is used for the energy requirement of the elongation process see figure 721 for an illustration of elongation stage in translation 3termination when the mrna moves it finally aligns one of the stop codons uag uaa or uga with a site they do not code for any amino acid hence there is no trna which comes into a site this releases the completed polypeptide chain to the cytosol the ribosome and the remainder of the translation assemble then fall apart polyribosomes polysomes when the mrna moves away for a sufficient distance a second ribosome can bind to it depending on the length of mrna a number of ribosomes can be attached to the mrna simultaneously as such mrnas that are being translated actively are associated with multiple ribosomes attached to a string of mrna forming polyribosomes or polysomes forming polyribosomes increases the rate of translation since they allow simultaneous translation by several ribosomes,transcription and translation are vital processes in gene expression i transcription definition the process of synthesizing rna from a dna template steps initiation rna polymerase binds to the promoter unwinds dna and starts synthesizing rna elongation rna polymerase adds complementary ribonucleotides in a 5 to 3 direction unwinding dna as it progresses termination in prokaryotes transcription ends when rna polymerase detaches after passing the termination sequence in eukaryotes the premrna undergoes processing before leaving the nucleus ii translation definition the process of synthesizing proteins from mrna steps initiation the small ribosomal subunit binds to mrna and initiator trna forming the translation initiation complex elongation amino acids are added sequentially to the growing polypeptide chain via peptide bonds with trna matching codons on mrna termination the process ends when a stop codon is reached releasing the completed polypeptide polyribosomes groups of ribosomes that translate mrna simultaneously increasing translation efficiency
the phenotype of an organism basically depends on the genetic information stored in dna and the final outcome is a result of the interaction between genetics of the organisms and the effects of the environment alterations in dna may bring about certain changes in the characters of individuals in a species which result in phenotypic variation among organisms these changes occur permanently and are called nucleotide sequence mutations significance of mutation in evolution mutations are the sources of variation seen among individuals of a species the effect of a mutation may be neutral beneficial or deleterious deleterious mutations may be lethal or at least they are less favorable than the original phenotype a mutation may also cause complete loss of a function in rare occasions the function of a polypeptide may be enhanced due to a mutation these are beneficial mutations entirely new functions may also be resulted by mutations for example an enzyme specific to a substrate may change due to mutation in such a way that it changes its specificity to act on another substrate the product due to the mutation is capable of catalyzing a new biochemical reaction beneficial mutations may contribute to the evolution of organisms types of mutation there are two major types of mutations based on the scale of alterations in the genetic material smallscale changes occurring in the sequence of nucleotides in a gene or largescale changes in the number or the structure of chromosomes these are known as gene mutations and chromosome aberrations or chromosome mutations respectively gene mutations the permanent alterations of dna sequence of a gene are called gene mutations they may be occurred due to rare errors occur during dna replication these are called spontaneous mutations in addition certain external factors can also cause mutations at a higher rate since these factors generate mutations they are called mutagens mutagenic agents can be classified as chemical or physical factors xrays and uv rays are examples for mutagenic physical agents the mutagenic agents can introduce changes to nucleotide sequences of dna and cause mutations during replication of the dna in a cell mutations are also the cause of carcinogenesis therefore mutagens are carcinogens and carcinogens are mutagens these chemicals and radiations need to be handled with utmost care types of gene mutations these are smallscale mutations involving only one nucleotide pair or more than one nucleotide pair if only one pair is altered these are called point mutations there are three types of gene mutations they are 1 a single nucleotide pair substitution change one nucleotide pair with another 2 nucleotide pair insertions addition of one or more nucleotide pairs 3 nucleotide pair deletions removal of one or more nucleotide pairs the substitution of a pair of nucleotide is a point mutation insertions or deletions can be point mutations or may involve more than one nucleotide pair substitution here one nucleotide pair is replaced by another pair figure 723 there is no change in the length of the gene and hence the polypeptide because the same amino acid may be coded by more than one codon some substitutions are silent mutations substitution of one nucleotide pair of a gene may not have an effect on the polypeptide it codes for because the same amino acid may be coded by more than one codons the third letter in the codon triplet has a wobble meaning that even if the third letter of a codon is replaced by another letter the same amino acid is coded in the third letter for example the codon 5 ggc3 on the mrna will be modified to 5 ggu3 if 3ccgs triplet on the dna template strand be altered as 3cca5 by substitution g with a a substitution may also change one amino acid in the polypeptide therefore the meaning of the primary structure of the polypeptide is changed slightly hence these mutations are missense mutations this substitution of the amino acid with another amino acid may or may not have significant impact on the tertiary or quaternary structure functional form of the protein occasionally this may render the protein a higher activity or even with new properties however very often these changes are either neutral or detrimental mutations make the proteins useless or less efficient t is also possible that a point mutation converts a codon coding for an amino acid to a stop codon this causes premature termination of the protein synthesis and therefore it is called nonsense mutation figure 723 the result is a shorter polypeptide than original which is usually non functional insertion and deletion these mutations bring about drastic changes in polypeptides compared to substitutions note nonsense mutations due to substitutions may also result in major changes insertion or deletion of a nucleotide or a couple of nucleotides will result in shift in the reading frame reading wrong codons after the point of mutation therefore such mutations are called frameshift mutations figure 723 resulting in extensive missense the polypeptide may not be functional at all unless the insertion or deletion occurred is very close to the termination codon it may also introduce a new stop codon which was not in the original sequence if that is the case the translation terminates causing nonsense mutation however if the insertion or deletion is a triplet or a multiple triplet the reading frame will be back to the original reading frame immediately after the point mutation figure 723 in such cases one or a small number of amino acids will be added or removed respectively from the entire sequence the message will only be slightly changed and the polypeptide may be functional depending on the importance of the mutated region of the polypeptide in its correct folding,the phenotype of an organism is determined by the interaction between its genetic information and environmental factors alterations in dna known as mutations lead to phenotypic variations and can be classified as neutral beneficial or deleterious mutations play a significant role in evolution by introducing genetic diversity types of mutations gene mutations permanent changes in dna sequence caused by spontaneous errors or mutagens eg chemicals radiation point mutations alterations of one nucleotide pair which can be silent no effect missense changes one amino acid or nonsense prematurely terminates protein synthesis insertions and deletions result in frameshift mutations causing shifts in the reading frame that can severely affect polypeptide function unless they are triplet or multiple triplet insertions overall mutations are critical for genetic variation and can influence evolutionary processes
since many genes are involved most of the chromosomal mutations are lethal while others are deleterious spontaneous abortions or miscarriages in mammals occur due to unusual numbers or structures of chromosomes such mutations also bring about various developmental disorders beneficial chromosome mutations are extremely rare in plants some chromosomal mutations cause beneficial variations i mutations due to alterations in chromosome structure large chunks of chromosomes which may include several genes to several hundred genes may be lost moved to another chromosome cut and paste copied and moved to another chromosome copy and paste or the orientation changed in chromosome mutations these four types of chromosome mutations are called deletion translocation duplication and inversion the loss of a part of a chromosome removes several genes and hence often these changes are lethal in translocation there is no loss of total amount of dna however the expression of genes can be altered due to the change in the environment at the new location the cutting of the chromosome may occur within a gene and if this happens that gene cannot function in duplication an extra piece of dna carrying many genes is present in another location of the genome this situation may also alter the gene expression usually leading to deleterious impacts on the phenotype the change of the orientation of a chunk of chromosome or inversions can also result in changes in gene expression most of these are adverse variations ii mutations due to alterations in chromosome number in addition to the structural changes of the chromosomes a cell may contain an entire chromosome or even a set of chromosomes in excess to the normal number of chromosomes a cell may also get one chromosome less than the normal number when there is one more or one less chromosome in a cell that situation is referred to as aneuploidy here the ploidy level has not changed but when a complete set of chromosomes are present in excess then ploidy level is said to be increased for example to triploid tetraploid hexaploid etc aneuploidy is resulted in by the mistakes in meiosis during meiosis the two sets of chromosomes in a diploid cell must separate and move towards the two poles of the cell however due to abnormal arrangement of homologous chromosomes both chromosomes of a pair may migrate to one pole so the other end has one less chromosomes the resulting cells or gametes in sexual reproduction also have either one more or one less chromosomes than the haploid number of chromosomes a similar result is obtained when chromatids of a chromosome do not separate and migrate to the opposite poles of the cell in meiosis ii the inability to separate a pair or pairs of chromosomes in meiosis is called nondisjunction figure 725 when a gamete with one less chromosomes unites with a normal gamete the resulting zygote is an aneuploid with 2n1 chromosomes this type of cells is called monosomic since a specific chromosome has only one of it a gamete with one more than the usual haploid set of chromosomes may fuse with a normal gamete the zygote will carry a chromosome in triplicate and hence 2n1 this aneuploidy status is called trisomic for that chromosome such abnormalities can take place also in mitosis ploidy level can also increase by abnormal separation of chromosomes a triploid 3n can result in fertilization of an abnormal diploid egg if a zygote does not divide into two daughter cells after the first steps in mitotic division it will carry four sets of chromosomes and be developed into a tetraploid 4n animals with higher ploidy level are very rare plants on the other hand can tolerate higher ploidy levels and often perform better than their diploid individuals examples of plants having higher ploidy levels banana triploid 3n wheat hexaploid 6n strawberries octaploid 8n polyploids are more common in invertebrates than in vertebrates among vertebrates polyploidy is observed in a few fishes and amphibians polyploids are rather normal compared to aneuploids although having higher number of chromosomes than usual polyploids maintain the genetic balance whereas genetic balance is lost in aneuploids,chromosomal mutations can significantly impact organisms often resulting in lethal or deleterious effects they can be categorized into two types alterations in chromosome structure and alterations in chromosome number i mutations due to alterations in chromosome structure deletion loss of a chromosome segment which often leads to lethality translocation segment moves to another chromosome potentially altering gene expression duplication extra chromosome segment present which can disrupt normal gene function inversion a segment of a chromosome is reversed which can affect gene expression adversely ii mutations due to alterations in chromosome number aneuploidy abnormal number of chromosomes one extra or one less caused by nondisjunction during meiosis resulting in conditions like monosomy 2n1 and trisomy 2n1 polyploidy an increase in the number of chromosome sets eg triploid tetraploid which is more tolerated in plants than animals polyploidy is more common in invertebrates and some plants while aneuploidy often leads to developmental disorders and miscarriages
i due to gene mutations two examples of human genetic disorders by gene mutations are described below colour blindness colour blindness or colour vision deficiency is a genetic disorder more common in males than in females due to mutations on one or more genes located in x chromosome these genes code for proteins that absorb different wavelengths of visible light these are visual pigments called photopsins which are categorized as red green or blue a person with a normal colour vision can distinguish different colours and their hues because they have all three categories of pigments in the retina the absorption of different proportions of different wavelengths by the pigments is resolved by the brain as the colour of the object in human genes coding red and green pigments are located in x chromosomes and gene for blue pigment is on the chromosome 7 since males have only one x chromosome and the relevant genes are absent in y chromosome any defect in one or both of these genes will make the phenotype in females at heterozygous condition a defective allele in one x chromosome is masked by the good allele in the other therefore colour vision deficiency is more common in males 58 of males than in females less than 1 of females colour blindness nearly always affects the perception of red or green colours because these are the genes that are sex linked sickle cell aneamia sickle cell aneamia is a genetic disease prevalent in human populations in africa and other warmer regions of the world a mutated allele of a gene coding for b globin subunit of hemoglobin the oxygen carrying pigment causes an abnormality of the hemoglobin molecules the presence of this abnormal hemoglobin in red blood cells changes the shape of the rbcs to curve as a sickle from its diskshape individuals with this disorder have fewer numbers of rbcs and hence develop aneamia this is because the sickled rbcs breakdown prematurely the mutation substitutes glutamic acid at a particular place in the primary structure of the b globin with valine figure 726 which results in abnormal folding of hemoglobin the mutated allele is codominant which means both normal 8 globin and mutated b globin are produced in individuals who are the heterozygous for this locus therefore they have both good and bad hemoglobin and hence both normal and sickled rbcs are present they are normally healthy and are the carriers of the mutant allele since the mutated alleles causes severely detrimental effects in homozygous individuals normally they should have been eliminated from the human population by natural selection however there is prevalence of malaria in warmer countries like in africa the heterozygous individuals will survive malaria attacks better than individuals with homozygous wild type alleles this is because the malaria parasite can not survive in sickled rbcs therefore at heterozygous individuals parasite density remains at a lower level ii due to chromosomal mutations chromosomal mutations bring about drastic changes in amount of genetic material or chromosome structure leading to abortions of the fetus in mammals if they survive they show a peculiar set of abnormal characteristics in the phenotype which are called syndromes three genetic disorders of humans due to aneuploidy are described below down syndrome down syndrome is also known as trisomy 21 because the cells of the affected individual contain an extra copy of chromosome 21 the syndrome shows characteristic facial features short body heart defects which can be corrected and developmental delays they have a high risk of developing leukemia and alzheimer disease almost all males and half of the females with down syndrome are sexually under developed and sterile their life span is shorter than normal but can live past middle age with proper medical treatment however they have a lower risk of high blood pressure atherosclerosis hardening of the arteries strokes and many types of solid tumors despite their abnormalities many live independently and are employed the risk of having a baby with down syndrome increases with the age of the mother this is caused by nondisjunction in meiosisi while down syndrome is due to trisomy of an autosome there are human genetic disorders due to aneuploidy in sex chromosomes as well the aneuploidy conditions in sex chromosomes cause turner syndrome due to monosomy and klinefelter syndrome due to trisomy turner syndrome turner syndrome is due to monosomy in x chromosome in very rare cases there are females with only one x chromosome and hence their genotype is xo this is the only known viable monosomy in humans these individuals are phenotypically female but they are sterile because their sex organs do not mature when girls affected with turner syndrome are treated with estrogen replacement therapy they develop secondary sex characters they have a short stature and some may have an extra skin on the neck webbed neck other characters are puffiness or swelling lymphedema of the hands and feet skeletal abnormalities heart defects high blood pressure and kidney problems most of them have normal intelligence klinefelter syndrome this is due to rare condition having an extra x chromosome in the genotype of xxy since it carries a y chromosome these individuals are males although these people have male sex organs they are sterile there testes are abnormally small one out of the two x chromosomes is inactivated yet these males may have enlarged breasts and may develop other female body characteristics they have subnormal less than normal intelligence xyy trisomy will make males and xxx trisomy will make female they do not show any syndrome and have normal male and female characteristics respectively they are fertile and slightly taller than the average genetic counseling genetic counseling is a service which is important for families having genetic disorders or families having a risk of genetic disorders this service is intended to estimate the risk a couple may have in conceiving a child with genetic disorders and providing necessary advice to avoid such instances genetic counseling is a profession that requires on one side a good knowledge of human genetics to understand how traits obeying the rules of simple mendelian inheritance would behave and on the other side an ability to provide guidance to minimize the risk of having a child with a genetic disorder if the family already has such a child the genetic counselor would also provide advice how to manage the situation and how to plan the birth of next child some of the genetic disorders are multifactorial which means several factors including multigene inheritance and that is also affected by environment for example heart attacks and diabetes may be inherited but the risk of developing the disease is affected by external environmental factors such as life style and food habits as such a clear pattern of inheritance of the disease cannot be traced the risk of the effect of a trait that follows simple mendelian laws of inheritance on a child to be conceived can be estimated by studying the history of the family with regard to a particular disorder and hence becomes the subject of genetic counseling if the disorder is caused by a dominant allele it can easily be observed in the potential parents however if the allele is recessive a parent or both the parents with normal phenotype may be homozygous for dominant allele or heterozygous carrier tracing the history of the family with regards to the disease using pedigree analysis would allow estimation of probability of parents being carriers and accordingly would estimate the probability of the risk of having a child with the disorder the information available through pedigree analysis sometimes is sufficient to determine exactly the genotype of one or both parents the genetic counselor explains the situation to the potential parents and guides them to choose the most suitable option in having a child techniques are now available to determine whether the already conceived fetus carries the mutant alleles for this the cells of the early fetus are sampled and dna is sequenced to find out the presence or absence of the mutant allele and if present whether the fetus is homozygous or heterozygous this information is very important to take well informed decision to keep the fetus or to abort it legislations of some countries allow abortions of such fetuses which would otherwise be born with genetic disorders this however is a difficult decision for parents to make therefore genetic counselor has a task of guiding the potential parents to make the best decision possible,human genetic disorders arise from gene and chromosomal mutations gene mutations color blindness affects color perception due to mutations in genes on the x chromosome that code for photopsins resulting in red or green color deficiencies more common in males 58 than females 1 sickle cell anemia caused by a mutation in the bglobin gene leading to sickleshaped red blood cells rbcs that break down prematurely causing anemia heterozygous individuals carry both normal and mutant alleles and have some protection against malaria chromosomal mutations down syndrome caused by trisomy 21 extra chromosome 21 resulting in developmental delays and characteristic features turner syndrome a monosomy of the x chromosome xo leading to female sterility and developmental issues klinefelter syndrome affected males xxy have an extra x chromosome leading to sterility and some female characteristics genetic counseling offers risk assessment for genetic disorders advising families on inheritance patterns and options for managing genetic conditions
tools techniques and methods in gene technology this section examines the process of gene technology starting from dna isolation through identification of desired dna sequences to gene technology or recombinant dna technology the isolated dna needs to be cut different pieces of dna must be joined and at times dna must be copied in vitro these involve several enzymes acting on dna distinguishing a unique dna sequence from the rest of the dna requires separation of dna based on the size of the fragments and identification of it in making genetically modified organisms this dna needs to be transferred to a recipient organism using a suitable method copying of dna is possible in vivo using cloning and in vitro using polymerase chain reaction pcr sequencing of dna has become a very important technique in many studies in dna isolation of dna gene technology begins with isolation of the target dna sequence from the total genome of the donor cells purified dna is required for many applications such as studying dna structure and chemistry examining dnaprotein interactions carrying out dna hybridizations sequencing pcr performing various genetic studies or gene cloning since dna molecules are very long the entire length of a dna molecule cannot be isolated except for shorter dna molecules such as plasmid dna and viral dna however breaking of dna or shearing has to be minimized during the extraction process the basic principles and major steps of dna isolation can be identified as follows homogenization or disruption of cells dna is located in the nucleus of the eukaryotic cells and it is concentrated in nucleoid in prokaryotic cells the first step in dna isolation is releasing the dna from the cells by breaking cells or lysis of the cells cells can be lysed by mechanical methods such as grinding and homogenization enzymatically by lysozyme to break bacterial cell wall inhibition of dnase when the cells are broken the dna may get in touch with dna degrading enzymes such as deoxyribonuclease dnase therefore dna must be protected from such enzymes causing shearing chelating agents are added to remove metal ions required for nuclease activity dissociation of nucleoprotein complexes dna needs to be freed from the proteins that bind to dna dnaprotein interactions are disrupted with detergents such as sds phenol or proteolytic enzymes removal of contaminating materials all other molecules in a cell are contaminants of dna removal of this contaminants is required for some applications precipitation of dna here the dna dissolved in aqueous phase is precipitated with cold ethanol the precipitate is usually redissolved in a buffer rna is removed by limited treatment with dnase free rnaase ribonuclease enzymes reacting with dna enzymes are required in cutting joining and copying of dna in vitro 1 restriction endonucleases there are several different types of nucleases in cells having different functions in gene technology cutting dna at precise locations is important the enzymes that recognize specific sequences of dna and cuts at or near these sites are called restriction endonucleases the position where the dna sequence is cut 1s called as restriction site or cleavage site figure 728 eg ecori source e coli 2dna ligase cut dna fragments from different sources are joined together by forming a phosphodiester bond by dna ligase to obtain recombinant dna molecules figure 727 t4 dna ligase is the most commonly used dna joining enzyme in gene technology the source of this enzyme is t4 bacteriophage 3 dna polymerases these are enzymes that add complementary deoxyribonucleotides to the template strand in a growing dna strand so that they copy dna these are therefore very important in gene technology especially in pcr and dna sequencing the most widely used dna polymerase is taq dna polymerase this is a heat stable enzyme isolated originally from the thermophilic bacterium thermus aquaticus in addition to the enzymes reacting with dna enzymes which can make dna on an rna template is also very useful in gene technology these enzymes are called reverse transcriptase because their action is the reverse of the transcription this is used to make cdna copy dna or complementary dna on an mrna template the dna shearing or cutting with restriction enzymes makes a mixture of dna fragments of different sizes in dna fingerprinting using pcr dna strands having different sizes are obtained therefore in many applications with dna separation of dna molecules becomes important separation of fragments having different size on a gel matrix is the most practical way of doing this agarose gel electrophoresis electrophoresis is a technique that separates large charged molecules such as dna rna and proteins according to their mobility in an electric field the speed of a molecule moving in an electric field depends on its net charge and the size in gel electrophoresis the molecules are moving through small pores of a matrix of gel this restricts the movement of the molecules and helps in separation according to the size larger molecules move slowly compared to smaller molecules in the case of nucleic acids the net charge depends on the length of the molecule and therefore the separation is based on the size for the separation of dna agarose gel electrophoresis is the most frequently used technique agarose is purified agar obtained from a type of seaweed this forms a polysaccharide matrix in the agarose gel electrophoresis equipment the gel is placed in buffer and a cathode and an anode are placed on either end of the gel figure 729a when a current is applied using a power supply the negatively charged dna molecules migrate towards the anode through the gel when preparing the gel wells are formed and the dna is loaded into these wells the separated dna can be stained by ethidium bromide and be visualized by exposing to uv light although stains like ethidium bromide show the presence of double stranded dna band on an agarose gel those stains cannot differentiate a band with a specific nucleotide sequence from the others in order to identify such a band among many other bands a dna probe is used dna probes and hybridization a dna probe is a fragment of single stranded labeled dna used to detect the presence of complementary nucleic acid sequences by hybridization labeling is a modification of the dna strand in such a way that it gives a signal which enables the detection of that dna strand the labeling can be done by for example incorporation of a radioactive isotope or addition of a fluorescent molecule to the structure of the probe this single stranded dna stretch can hybridize to complementary single strand of dna or rna therefore before hybridizing with the probe the double stranded dna needs to be denatured to make room for the probe the denatured bands on the gel need to be transferred to a nitrocellulose or nylon filter membrane by a process called southern blotting the bands are then fixed to the membrane then the labeled probe is added to the membrane and allowed to renature the probes will bind strongly only to the complementary sequences which are fixed to the membrane when the membrane is washed the probe is removed except the probes bound to the bands with target nucleotide sequence if the probe is radioactively labelled the band with the target sequence can be identified by autoradiography of the membrane if the probe is labeled with a fluorescent dye the band can be identified using uv light,gene technology involves several critical processes beginning with dna isolation and culminating in recombinant dna technology key steps include dna isolation extracting target dna from donor cells requiring purification to study dna structure perform sequencing and cloning homogenization breaking cells to release dna dnase inhibition protecting dna from degradation using chelating agents dissociation of nucleoprotein complexes removing proteins that bind to dna using detergents precipitation isolating dna using cold ethanol enzymes in gene technology restriction endonucleases cut dna at specific sites dna ligase joins dna fragments to create recombinant dna dna polymerases copy dna in pcr and sequencing gel electrophoresis separates dna fragments by size using an electric field in agarose gel dna probes singlestranded labeled dna that identifies specific sequences by hybridization after denaturing doublestranded dna
in dna cloning the dna replication machinery of a host cell is used to copy the desired dna however inserting a fragment of dna into a host cell will not be copied unless an origin of replication ori is present in that therefore in order to replicate the recombinant dna molecule or dna of interest it has to be combined with dna with ori and that can be replicated independent of the chromosomal dna chromosomal dna replicates only once in a cell division in a bacterial host there are several copies of plasmids and also when infected with a bacteriophage a large number of copies of viral dna per bacterial cell are present as such the dna molecule of interest can be integrated into these selfreplication units which are called vectors vectors the vectors are vehicles to carry the dna of interest into a host for multiplication or cloning the vectors used in cloning of dna are called cloning vectors when the vector is carrying the foreign dna it is called a recombinant vector making a recombinant vector also follows the same procedure for making the recombinant dna molecule here the gene of interest has to be cut with a restriction enzyme and the vector plasmid or the viral dna should also be cut with the same enzyme these two should be mixed and allowed to integrate and ligated using dna ligase figure 730 the site in the vector where the dna to be cloned is inserted is a called cloning site in order to be able to use several restriction enzymes to cut dna both the vector and the dna to be cloned the cloning site contains a sequence which carry sites for many restriction enzymes therefore this is called multiple cloning site a host cell usually a bacterial host which can copy the vector is then transformed by the recombinant vector the host then will copy the plasmid carrying the dna of interest a number of recombinant plasmid is present in each descendent cell of the colony of bacterial host types of vectors and their differences any selfreplicating unit in a particular host cell can be used as a vector in bacteria plasmids and bacteriophages are used as vectors plasmids are present in yeast cells also therefore they can also be used as vectors in yeast the yeast cloning vectors are called yeast artificial chromosomes or yacs they are plasmids but are called chromosomes because they carry sequences of centromeres they work as chromosomes when they are linearized in addition they also have autonomously replicating sequences ars to enable them to replicate independent of the cell division all of these vectors carry genes which are not necessary for a vector these are removed and this space is used to insert the dna of interest the yeast vectors should contain sequence of centromere and autonomously replicating sequences ars as described above main purpose of cloning vector is to copy dna in an in vivo system for this number of copies in a single host has to be high so this condition is fulfilled by bacterial plasmids bacteriophages and yacs the transformation of cells is a very inefficient process however using bacteriophages as vectors overcome this problem because the vector can be inserted to the host cell by the mechanism of infection of the bacteriophage an advantage of yacs is that they are large therefore large amount of dna can be copied using them it has also another advantage because they operate in the eukaryotic system the copies of the dna of interest or recombined dna is retrieved by harvesting the host cells releasing the vectors by lysis isolation of the vectors and cutting the dna with the same restriction enzymes that was used originally to isolate the fragment of dna the recombinant dna is then isolated after separation and detection on an agarose gel after electrophoresis use of marker genes the efficiency of the transformation of the host cells with the recombinant plasmid vector is very low this means that for one transformed host cell there are millions or billions of cells that are not transformed both transformed and untransformed cells will make colonies in a suitable medium but these cannot be distinguished therefore some sort of marker gene should be engineered into the cloning vector so that the few colonies originating from the transformed cells can be screened among many untransformed cells most common markers are antibiotic resistance genes the host cell is sensitive to the particular antibiotic and hence will not grow on a medium containing the antibiotic since the vector is carrying the gene for resistance the transformed cells can grow in the medium with antibiotic such markers are called selectable markers since they allow the growth of only the transformed cells there is another problem to be solved the transformation does not necessarily mean that the insert is there not all vectors are recombined with the gene of interest therefore another marker is required to distinguish the colonies with the vector containing the insert from those with vector only the second marker located at the multiple cloning site becomes inactive due to the insertion,dna cloning involves using a host cells replication machinery to copy desired dna which must be combined with a selfreplicating unit called a vector that contains an origin of replication ori common types of vectors include plasmids circular dna in bacteria allowing multiple copies per cell bacteriophages viruses that infect bacteria efficiently transferring dna into host cells yeast artificial chromosomes yacs used in yeast they can carry large dna fragments and replicate independently the process of making a recombinant vector includes cutting the dna of interest and the vector with the same restriction enzyme then ligating them the cloning site within the vector contains a multiple cloning site mcs for various restriction enzymes to select transformed cells marker genes typically antibiotic resistance genes are included allowing only transformed cells to grow in the presence of antibiotics a second marker helps confirm the presence of the insert by becoming inactive upon successful insertion
when a genome is cut into random pieces by shearing using mechanical force or by restriction enzymes it creates an extremely large number of different sequences depending on the size of the genome all these pieces can be integrated into cloning vectors and the recombinant vectors can be used to transform bacterial hosts these hosts can then be cultivated in a suitable medium for selection of transformed cells and screening for transformed cells with vectors carrying an insert since there was no selection for a particular segment of dna in this case each transformed cell with an insert may carry a different piece of dna of the genome selected earlier when all colonies are isolated and cultivated separately the collection of these colonies is referred to as a genomic dna library figure 732 dna libraries are a collection of microbial cultures each propagating a different fragments of a total genomic dna which are cloned in a population of identical vectors inserts of each colony can be sequenced separately in order to have a complete sequence of the genome this is how the elucidation of sequence human genome under the human genome project started there is another type of dna libraries these are called cdna libraries these libraries contain complementary dna obtained by reverse transcription of the mrnas isolated from cells tissues collection of mrnas of a cell is called transcriptome mrnas are isolated and reverse transcribed into a dna strand complementary to the mrnas the enzyme used here is reverse transcriptase the second dna strand is replicated on the first dna template using dna polymerase to obtain double stranded cdna the dna fragments are cloned and similar procedure is followed as for genomic dna library in order to construct a cdna library dna libraries are basically used as sources of dna fragments for sequencing cdna libraries also reflect the pattern of expression of genes dna delivery systems a cell contacting foreign dna is called a transformed cell getting the foreign dna in a cell can be done using several methods e transformation in this method a large number of copies of dna of interest is mixed eg a recombined vector with host cells this is based on the ability of a cell to take up dna from its surroundings through the cell membrane the efficiency is very low in getting the dna into the cells various treatments can increase the competency ability to take up dna from outside of host cells e transduction this method is based on the ability of bacteriophages to infect host cells viruses infecting plants and animals can also be used as vectors to deliver foreign dna into plant and animal hosts the gene of interest is integrated into the modified viral genome and packaged into the protein capsid this viral particle can pass the recombined dna as in its normal infection process the capsid protects the dna and this method is more efficient than transformation e gene gun in this method small particles of a heavy metal such as gold are coated with a large number of copies of the dna of interest and the particles are shot at high velocity into the cells to be transformed the equipment used is the gene gun agrobacterium mediated gene transfer agrobacterium is a soil bacterium which can infect plants their mode of infection is very special the infection causes a tumor on the plant and the bacterium is living inside it the disease is called crown gall disease the cells in the tumor or gall are actually genetically transformed by a segment of a plasmid of agrobacterium this plasmid is called ti tumor inducing plasmid figure 734 a part of this plasmid can actually be transferred to plant genome and hence called transfer dna or tdna tdna contains genes which induce formation of a tumor and also characters associated with pathogenicity what is needed for transfer of the dna is the right and left boarder sequences of the tdna therefore scientists have removed most of the bacterial genes including virulent genes from tdna and have made room for inserting genes of interest into this space between the two border sequences agrobacterium can deliver this modified tdna with inserted gene to plant cells through its infection ability however plant cells will not become sick because the virulent genes have been removed from tdna this is called disarming the tdna,when a genome is sheared into random pieces these fragments can be inserted into cloning vectors to create recombinant vectors which are then transformed into bacterial hosts the resulting collection of transformed colonies is known as a genomic dna library which allows for the sequencing of different dna fragments an alternative is the cdna library formed from complementary dna synthesized via reverse transcription of mrna which reflects gene expression patterns key methods for introducing foreign dna into cells include transformation uptake of dna by a host cell often requiring treatments to increase cell competency transduction use of bacteriophages to deliver dna into host cells offering a more efficient method than transformation gene gun a device that shoots dnacoated metal particles into cells at high velocity agrobacteriummediated gene transfer utilizes the soil bacterium agrobacterium which transfers tumorinducing dna tdna into plants modified to carry desired genes without causing disease
when the morphological characters are used to classify the number of characters available is limited so that usually the smallest group identified is a species when more characters are available more divisions such as subspecies strains varieties etc become possible biochemical properties ie enzyme activities are useful characters in classification to separate organisms into smaller groups since characters are controlled by the combination of the genetics of the organism and its environment above mentioned characters may vary depending on the environment hence if one needs to look how two groups of organisms are similar or different genetically he has to investigate at the dna level various techniques for dna analysis have been developed to facilitate the identification of genetic similarities and differences among organisms and some of these can be used even to identify an individual these techniques are used in conjunction with techniques such as dna isolation gel electrophoresis and use of probes that were discussed above restriction maps as shown earlier restriction enzymes cut dsdna into fragments at specific sequences depending on the number of restriction sites and where they are located a number of fragments of varying sizes will be generated different restriction enzymes cut at different sites and generate different numbers of fragments having different sizes a restriction map is a diagram showing the position of each restriction site with respect to each other and the distance between these sites figure 735 distances can be measured by cm centi morgans or number of base pairs restriction maps are very important in construction of cloning vectors cloning vectors are cut by restriction enzymes at the cloning site to insert the fragments of dna from other sources to the cloning site dna sequencing a dna molecule is made of two complementary and antiparallel strands each comprising four bases adenine guanine cytosine and thymine arranged linearly in a sequence dna sequencing is a process to determine the precise order of these bases in a dna molecule the techniques have been improved greatly since the introduction of dna sequencing in 1977 the technology of dna sequencing that was available by the time of obtaining the sequence of entire human genome in 2003 under the human genome project was called first generation sequencing technology those methods were time consuming and it was possible to determine the sequence only of short dna fragments the technology developed since then to next generation sequencing or second generation sequencing and to the most modern third generation sequencing technology the most modern technology can sequence strands of lengths of millions of nucleotides and therefore the time required for sequencing has reduced greatly although the human genome project took 15 years to complete the sequencing of human genome one can today obtain his her genome sequenced in several hours at a cost 1000 us 2018 with the development of the technology of dna sequencing its applications also have been widened applications of dna sequencing molecular biology information on base sequence of dna is important in understanding the functions of dna genes coding for a polypeptide can be located by studying the dna sequence certain domains in the dna sequence of a gene specify the function of the protein for example whether the protein will be a transmembrane protein or whether it is a dna binding protein dna sequencing has revealed the presence of multiple copies of genes in human genome although amino acid sequence of a peptide can be determined using an amino acid sequencer it has now become easier to work out the amino acid sequence via dna sequence evolutionary biology dna is passed from generation to generation over time changes occur and accumulated in the dna therefore the similarities and differences in the sequences of dna of individuals within a species and among different species reveal their evolutionary relationships sequencing of dna samples obtained from ancient humans remains preserved for example as mummies or buried in ice or as fossilized remains has given insight into when the homo sapiens evolved and how they migrated to conquer the world medicine certain families inherit some genetic disorders sequencing of dna reveals if a healthy person is a carrier or not how a particular disease causing allele is distributed among family members is very important in assessing the risk and to plan a management similarly diagnosis of cancer is also possible through dna sequencing the response to a drug given for cancer can be followed by sequencing dna carried in the blood of a patient if a drug is responding then the dna sequences related to cancer must be reduced in blood dna isolated from a placenta of a fetus is useful in early diagnosis of presence of genetic disorders forensics except for identical twins it is extremely rare that two individuals share exactly the same sequence of dna that means dna sequencing can identify an individual having the same dna sequences as dna material from blood hair sperm saliva etc found in a crime scene similarly paternity testing is another use of dna sequencing metagenomics microbiome is the totality of microorganisms in a particular habitat including human body and different environments conventional methods for studying the microorganisms in a microbiome are based on culturing in pure cultures however a large number of microorganisms are unculturable and hence are largely neglected metagenomics is a science in which total dna present in an environment is extracted as community dna and studying this sample as a whole sequencing some specific sequences in this community dna and analysis using suitable software will reveal the number of different species and their identity some of these are presently known and many others may be new species therefore metagenomics studies are important in ecology epidemiology and other fields,classification of organisms begins with morphological characters but can be expanded using biochemical properties leading to finer divisions like subspecies and strains to understand genetic similarities and differences dna analysis techniques are essential key processes include restriction maps diagrams showing the position of restriction enzyme sites in dna crucial for cloning vector construction dna sequencing determines the order of bases adenine guanine cytosine thymine in dna advances in sequencing technologies have drastically reduced time and cost for genome sequencing applications of dna sequencing molecular biology identifies gene functions and protein characteristics evolutionary biology reveals relationships among species through dna changes over generations medicine aids in diagnosing genetic disorders and cancers forensics identifies individuals based on unique dna sequences useful in crime scene analysis and paternity testing metagenomics studies the total dna in an environment to explore unculturable microorganisms essential for understanding ecosystems and epidemiology
the unique set of genetic markers of an individual makes its dna fingerprint or genetic profile the presence absence of markers are nowadays determined by mostly pcr using specific primers for the marker see below these markers are called small tandem repeats str markers or microsatellite dna eukaryotic dna contains some noncoding sequences where two to six base pairs are repeated tandemly one after the other 100 to 1000 times so that the lengths of these repeats vary since they are noncoding variations do not have an impact on phenotype these are variable in individuals so that can be used as makers the advantages of using str markers are they occur frequently in genome easily amplified by pcr highly variable polymorphisms and a large number of characterized strs are available the method used earlier was probing specific sequences using labeled markers as describes earlier see dna probes and hybridization in dna profiling a set of markers probes or pcr primers is used a dna fingerprint cannot be obtained by using one marker since there are many individuals with the same banding pattern when more and more markers are used in combination the probability of finding the same pattern reduced it has been calculated that if 13 markers are used the probability becomes between 10 billion to several trillions since the world population is in the region of seven billion it is highly unlikely that two individuals to have the same genetic profile fingerprint applications of dna fingerprinting criminal identification and victim identification figure 737 the fingerprints of the suspects are matched with fingerprints obtained from biological material obtained from a crime scene the experts opinion on the identity of the criminal is accepted by the courts of law paternity testing figure 738 the dna fingerprint of a child is never identical to that of either the father or the mother however the child shares some markers from the father and others from the mother therefore when the paternity of a child is in question dna profiling can be accurately used to confirm or rule out a person as the father of that particular child identifying infectious agents when probes or primers are known to obtain the fingerprint of a pathogenic infectious organism dna fingerprinting can detect the presence or absence of this organism in the patient or in food or water,dna fingerprinting or genetic profiling relies on unique genetic markers called small tandem repeats strs or microsatellite dna these markers consist of noncoding sequences of two to six base pairs repeated multiple times varying in length among individuals str markers are advantageous because they occur frequently in the genome are easily amplified by pcr polymerase chain reaction exhibit high variability polymorphisms have many characterized strs available a single marker cannot reliably identify an individual due to shared patterns among many people however using multiple markers eg 13 strs significantly reduces the probability of matching making it highly unlikely for two individuals to have identical dna profiles applications of dna fingerprinting include criminal identification matching dna from crime scenes to suspects paternity testing determining if an individual is the biological father based on shared genetic markers identifying infectious agents detecting pathogens in patients food or water using specific dna probes
polymerase chain reaction pcr is used to copy sequences of dna in vitro mimicking the dna replication as in replication a dna polymerase enzyme is needed to catalyze the reaction of elongation of the new dna strand the raw materials needed are the deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate dntps which are the four deoxyribonucleotides datp dgtp dttp and dctp a single stranded template dna is required since the dna polymerase cannot initiate dna replication a primer is also needed in pcr a primer is a specific sequence of dna with a small number of nucleotides oligonucleotide which is complementary to a sequence at 3 end of the target dna to be copied to copy both the strands two primers each binding to either of the two strands at 3 end are used in the cell the primer is an rna sequence in addition to these mg is also required these become the ingredients in pcr mix the dna fragment in which the sequence to be copied is present in dsdna and hence it needs to be denatured denaturation is done by heating the pcr mix to 95 c at this temperature most of the enzymes will denature and therefore it may be necessary to add dna polymerase after the denaturation however the enzymes of the thermophilic organisms are resistant to high temperature therefore the common heat resistant dna polymerase used in pcr is taq dna polymerase which is obtained from thermophilic bacterium thermus aquaticus the primer will bind to the complementary sequence of the denatured template dna this happens at a lower temperature and this step is called annealing the annealing temperature will depend on the sequence and the length of the primer once the annealing of the primer is achieved then the primer extension dna synthesis will take place at a different temperature this is the optimum temperature of the dna polymerase used when sufficient time is given a complementary copy of the template dna is completed at the end of this first thermal cycle denaturation annealing and extension temperatures one copy of each strand is produced however these are longer than the intended copy of the target dna sequence figure 739 after a couple of pcr cycle an exact copy of the target dna is synthesized after this copies of the target dna will be produced in an exponential manner ie 2 4 8 16 etc after each cycle a typical pcr will have 35 to 40 cycles at the end millions of copies of the desired dna sequence will be produced from a single template dna molecule pcr is an essential technique in cloning procedure which allows generation of large amounts of pure dna from tiny amount of template strand and further study of a particular gene applications of pcr analyzing clinical specimens for the presence of infectious agents eg hiv hepatitis malaria analysis of mutations causing genetic diseases eg cystic fibrosis sickle cell aneamia phenylketonuria used in forensics laboratories since pcr can make a large number of copies from a small number of template dna it is especially useful because only a tiny amount of original dna is required eg droplet of blood or a single hair pcr is an essential technique in cloning procedure which allows generation of large amounts of pure dna from tiny amount of template strand and further study of a particular gene sequencing of dna depends on pcr pcr has been used to identify and to explore relationships among species in the field of evolutionary biology in anthropology it is also used to understand the ancient human migration patterns in archaeology it has been used to spot the ancient human race pcr commonly used by paleontologists to amplify dna from extinct species or cryopreserved fossils of millions of years old and can thus be further studied to elucidate on their evolutionary relationships,polymerase chain reaction pcr is a technique used to amplify specific dna sequences in vitro mimicking natural dna replication key components of pcr include dna polymerase enzyme that synthesizes new dna strands deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates dntps four building blocks datp dgtp dttp dctp necessary for dna synthesis primers short sequences of dna that bind to the target dna and initiate replication two primers are used for both strands mg essential cofactor for dna polymerase activity pcr involves three main steps denaturation heating the mix to 95 c to separate dna strands annealing lowering the temperature to allow primers to bind to the template dna extension dna polymerase synthesizes new dna strands at an optimal temperature this cycle is repeated 35 to 40 times resulting in exponential amplification of the target dna pcr has numerous applications including diagnosing infectious diseases eg hiv analyzing genetic mutations forensic analysis from small dna samples cloning and sequencing dna investigating evolutionary relationships and ancient human migrations
the host with the extra trait introduced by genetic engineering techniques is called a genetically modified organism gmo some related terms are genetically engineered microorganisms gems transgenic organisms and living modified organisms lmos the food and feed obtained from gmos are called genetically modified food gmf since majority of the crop plants farm animals and pets animals used today are genetically modified by domestication it is important to note that what is referred to as gmos in todays context are essentially the organisms derived as a result of rdna technology note it is important to realize that animal cloning is not a gene technology it does not include any of the above mentioned steps the steps in the process making a genetically modified plant or an animal are as follows 1 identification of a suitable gene 2 isolation and purification of the gene 3 amplification of the gene by cloning 4 in vitro modifications of the gene of interest 5 amplification of modified gene by cloning 6 transformation of the recipient cells microbial cells cells or protoplasts of plants or fertilized eggs of animals 7 screening for expression of the inserted gene 8 monitoring for stable integration of the modified gene 9 backcrossing to introduce the new trait to other varieties of crops and breeds of animals the applications of gene technology can be found in many fields including agriculture medicine and industry applications of gmo in agriculture with the growing human population and decrease in agriculture land it becomes obvious that the crop yield per unit area needs to be increased in order to achieve an economically sustainable agriculture a higher crop yield should be obtained with a low cost of production improving the quality of foods is also a major concern in agriculture in addition to the quantity the green revolution from 1930s to 1960s increased the crop yield by introducing high yielding crops and use of artificial fertilizer and pesticides however impact of green revolution is also limited and is now being overcome by the genetically modified plants gm crops when a single plant cell is genetically modified it can be regenerated in a plant as plant cells are totipotent when a useful trait is introduced into a crop it can be introduced to other varieties of the same crop by plant breeding most significant contributions in crop yield enhancement by gene technology in agriculture are due to the production of gm crops that are resistant to pests and diseases herbicides and environmental stresses in addition crops with higher nutritional values are also available eg golden rice enriched with vitamin a increased triglycerides content in canola oil plants resistant to pests several gm crops have been engineered with a gene producing a toxic protein that kills the plant eating larval stages of certain lepidopteron and coleopteron insects most widely cultivated pest resistant gm plants are cotton maize canola and potato a gm rice variety resistant to lepidopteron insects is also available the protein is called bt toxin since the protein originally came from a bacterium bacillus thuringiensis different strains of this bacterium produce several different bt toxins whenlarvae feed on plant parts that express bt toxins they die due to the ingestion of the toxin bt toxins are not harmful to mammals and are therefore considered safe for human consumption however btmaize btcorn is grown mostly for bio fuel and for animal feed since the toxin is present in the plant tissues the only insects that are killed are plant pests and therefore bt crops are also considered safe for beneficial insects figure 741 show some insect pests of com and cotton bt toxins are natural products and therefore are biodegradable however the insects when exposed to the same toxin over the time develop resistance to that toxin rendering the gm crop useless several solutions to delay the resistance development in insects have been proposed since the pollen grains containing the toxin can escape from the field where btcrop is planted insects that are not feeding on the crop may also be killed by accidental ingestion of such pollen therefore bt crops has a potential danger for nontarget insects plants resistant to diseases a well known example of disease resistant crops developed by genetic engineering is the availability of new varieties of papaya resistant to papaya virus prsv this virus is limiting the success of papaya cultivation worldwide the same virus also attacks the cucurbits squash with resistance to the virus has been successfully developed and cultivated other examples for disease resistant crops are potato varieties resistant to potato virus y pvy potato leaf roll virus plrv and late blight disease ringspot plants resistant to herbicides the herbicide tolerant crops htcs are developed in order to be able to spray a broadspectrum herbicide to control weeds when the crop has been established in the field when the crop is resistant to the herbicide that is sprayed it can kill all the weeds without harming the crop the advantage in this is that the farmers can wait and see if the weeds become a problem and can use herbicide only when it is necessary this reduces the herbicide usage however if the same herbicide is used repeatedly the weeds resistant to that particular herbicide will develop these are called superweeds when a crop with resistance to one herbicide is planted after a gm crop with resistance to the same herbicide leftover seeds of the previous crop may germinate and become a weed which cannot be controlled by the same herbicide in order to avoid these problems rotation of crops with tolerance to different herbicides can be practiced the best known examples of herbicide tolerant crops htcs are crops modified to tolerate the herbicide glyphosate these plants are known as roundup ready crops because the commercial name of glyphosate is roundup the examples of commercially available roundup ready crops are cotton maize canola soybean sugar beet and wheat another type of popular herbicide tolerant crops are called liberty link and in vigor and are resistant to glufosinate examples of glufosinate resistant crops include cotton maize canola soybean sugar beet and rice cotton modified to tolerate bromoxinol are called bxn cotton gm plants with other important traits other agriculturally important traits include improving product quality one of the priorities in this area is to increase the nutritional value of crops gm canola varieties with increased triglyceride component and with increased phytase enzyme to breakdown indigestible plant phytate to release phosphorus gm potato with reduced amylose and increased amylopectin content and soybean with increased oleic acid content in the seed are commercially available a rice variety named golden rice with increased levels of provitamin a is an interesting example of product quality enhancement the commercially available variety is modified with genes from pantoea ananatis a plant pathogenic bacterium containing a yellow pigment tomato with delayed fruit ripening to increase the flavour and reduce the rate of softening is another interesting development in gm crops the source of the gene is tomato itself a part of the gene is copied in reverse direction by changing the orientation of the promoter applications in medicine human insulin vaccines and other therapeutics are being produced using gmos these pharmaceuticals produced by gmo are cheaper since mass production at low cost is possible and are considered safer producing human insulin by genetically engineered coli is the best known example of the use of genetically modified organisms in producing pharmaceuticals insulin extracted from animals had various side effects on diabetic patients the cost of production was also very high due to the limited amount of source to extract insulin since those insulins are not the same as human insulin they were less effective nowadays the entire insulin supply is from coi genetically engineered by inserting insulin gene from human therefore the bacteria derived insulin is exactly the same as its original product hepatitis b vaccine used today is a recombinant vaccine produced in yeast engineering plants to produce vaccines in their edible parts is a concept being experimented the idea is to express an antigenic protein in the plant cells when the edible part with the antigen eg fruit is consumed by someone the person will develop antibodies against the antigen so that immunity is developed against a particular disease these are called edible vaccines and if this becomes successful low cost safe vaccines can be produced and the delivery of the vaccine would be painless storage will also not be a main problem therefore these are more important in less developed regions of the world gm mammalian cells grown in cell culture are used to extract factor viii used to treat hemophiliacs and tissue plasminogen activator tpa used to treat heart attack and stroke patients after the completion of human genome project the causes for various genetic diseases are being identified with ease and speed when the cause is identified how to correct the mistake in the defective genes can also be worked out the incorrect gene then can be replaced with the correct one by gene technology if the problem is the expression of a specific gene this technology can also influence the expression of that gene this treatment is called gene therapy or human gene transfer the dna is delivered to the target cells extracted from the patient by using a viral vector or as naked dna using various techniques the cells with corrected gene are reintroduced into the appropriate tissue of the patient although the concept of gene therapy has a long history since 1972 only a few applications are available to date a gene therapy to treat leukemia 1s the first of that type in the usa another example of gene therapy is to replace the mutated betaglobin gene causing sickle cell anemia with the correct gene during this procedure bone marrow derived hematopoietic stem cells are extracted from the patient the normal beta globin gene is inserted into these cells and return the modified cells back into the patient the corrected bone marrow stem cells will produce normal erythrocytes the concept of personalized medicine is being developed which is based on genetic information of the patient to treat or prevent diseases gm insects have been employed to control insect vector born disease gm mosquitoes have been engineered which do not allow entry of malaria parasite into the gut therefore breaking the life cycle of the parasite release of these mosquitoes into the wild would reduce incidence of malaria another example is the making of gm male mosquitoes carrying a male sterile gene mass release of these male sterile insects results in mating with females but not producing offspring this technology is call sterile insect technology sit in field trials in brazil the aedes aegypti populations have reduced by 95 by the introduction of sterile gm males applications in industry use of gmos in industry has made it possible to produce novel products with low cost while minimizing environmental impacts industries based on organisms or their products run at ambient temperatures and pressures demanding less energy apart from the booming pharmaceutical industry based on gmos and gm crop industry some products originated from gmos are produced industrially some enzymes for food processing and detergents are products of gems chymosin rennin or rennet is the first approved enzyme produced by gmo this is used in cheese industry to coagulate milk to separate whey chymosin has been obtained by extracting it from stomachs of slaughtered calves since the supply was limited the cost was high and it affected dairy industry the chymosin gene from cattle has been engineered in yeast cells and these recombinant yeasts are the source of chymosin today the price has gone down considerably and the product is purer and devoid of contaminants of animal origin amyl maltase is another enzyme produced by a gm bacillus sp this enzyme modifies starch to be used as an ingredient in dairy industry,genetically modified organisms gmos are created through genetic engineering techniques including the introduction of specific genes to enhance desired traits key steps in creating gmos include gene identification isolation modification and integration into recipient cells gmos are crucial in agriculture for increasing crop yields and improving quality through pest resistance crops like bt corn produce a toxin from bacillus thuringiensis that targets pests but is safe for humans and beneficial insects disease resistance varieties such as virusresistant papaya protect against limiting agricultural diseases herbicide resistance crops like roundup ready plants tolerate specific herbicides allowing for effective weed control in medicine gmos produce insulin and vaccines while gene therapy aims to correct genetic diseases industrially gmos enable the production of enzymes for food processing overall gmos enhance agricultural efficiency contribute to medical advancements and promote sustainable industrial practices
the most significant risk factor in use of gmos is their possible unintended effects since this is a relatively new technology public is reluctant to accept it readily however the public also accepts the unlimited potentials of the gmos the debate between progmo and antigmo groups organizations and individuals is intensive some of the controversial issues about gmos are mentioned below health issues 1 data of some experiments involving rats mice and other animals showed some health implications after feeding with genetically modified food such as potato maize tomato and soybean the reports include damage to various tissues such as stomach liver and kidney and even increase in deaths however many other scientists question the methodology used in such experiments and they also claim that they could not reproduce the results therefore more independent research is needed to confirm or to reject such claims 2 allergy development due to consumption of gm food or inhaling pollen of gm crops is discussed as another health issue the integration of foreign dna in the host cells may change gene expression or cause mutations leading to unpredictable products some of them may be allergenic toxic or even carcinogenic however concrete scientific research findings are not available or the findings are doubtful the technology is now developed so that the insertion can be done at precise locations without disturbing other functions of the host 3 the possibility of horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistant genes used as marker gene is also highlighted as a potential health issue the gm foods contain such genes and are ingested in large quantities by consumers although there a possibility all organisms have barriers to horizontal gene transfer and therefore chance of horizontal gene transfer into humans is very low horizontal gene transfer among bacteria is more probable and hence transfer of antibiotic resistance to pathogenic organisms may have some health related issues however the antibiotics used in rdna technology are not used in chemotherapy on the other hand the humans as well as all other animals have been eating food of animal or plant origin ever since they were evolved but there is no evidence to show genes transferred due to eating food environmental issues 1 the development of insect tolerant crops may harm the nontarget insect by accidentally ingesting the toxin produced in the gm crops the toxin may be dispersed in pollen and deposit on noncrop plants which the insects feed on an experiment has shown that monarch butterfly larvae feeding on milk weed leaves dusted with pollen from gm crops die however proponents of gm argue that the amount of pollen dusted on the leaves is very much higher than the amount that could be deposited naturally 2 cross pollination will transfer the transgene the foreign gene to other nongm varieties of the same crop as well as wild relatives of the crop it can therefore contaminate organic or nongm farming 3 when bt gene is transferred to wild plants the insects feeding on them will die causing environmental imbalances 4 when the herbicide resistance genes are transferred to weeds they cannot be controlled using the same herbicide and therefore become super weeds 5 the spread of a foreign gene in naturally growing plants is called gene pollution 6 since the herbicide tolerant crops are resistant to a particular weedicide farmers may tend to over use this herbicide to keep their fields clean if that is the case herbicide tolerant weeds will develop by frequent exposure of the weeds to the same herbicide it is however argued that the farmers will not spend money just to have a clean field and they can use a wait and see approach in order to spray herbicides only when necessary rather than spraying as a precaution rotation of crops with tolerance to different herbicides will avoid development of such super weeds 7 as gm crops are being accepted by farmers as well as consumers the extent of land under cultivation will be dominated by gm crops limited to very few varieties when the crop diversity is reduced to such a small number the tolerance to environmental impacts become very low and a single environmental event may wipe out entire crop fields leading to food scarcity 8 narrowing down of crop diversity will contribute to loss of genes from the crop gene pool socioeconomic issues 1 the newly developed gm crop varieties will be owned by the developers and patented therefore the farmers are compelled to purchase their seeds every year from giant seed companies with a monopoly spending a lot of money poor farmers may not be able afford to buy the seeds and therefore there is a risk of widening the gap between the rich and the poor farmers 2 there is a growing public concern whether it is ethically correct to patent crops and biological resources including genes that are found in nature some crops and products that have been developed traditionally and used by indigenous people have been patented under some biotechnology companies 3 the consumer has the right to decide whether he she purchases gm or nongm food to secure this right the regulatory agencies need to implement a system of labeling to indicate clearly whether the product is gm or not and if it is gm then what are the changes that have been made labeling is mandatory in some countries however products labeled non gm have often been found to be contaminated with gm when tested 4 biological resources of a country or region with high biodiversity and traditional knowledge are taken away by biotechnology companies without any authorization by the countries and people or without paying compensation for product development this is called biopiracy 5 the manipulation of the nature in making gmos contradicts the beliefs of certain religions in order to address potential risks and hazards of gmo gmf and associated processes a thorough testing and screening procedures have come into effect as such the process of producing and commercialization of gmo and gme are under strict control of several legislations and authorities in order to safeguard the consumer society and environment approval of some gmos has taken 25 years from the creation to market eg gm atlantic salmon which grow twice as faster than non gm an example of an international agreement is cartagena protocol many countries also have their own legislations such as national biosafety framework of sri lanka,genetically modified organisms gmos present several concerns across health environmental and socioeconomic dimensions health risks include potential damage to organs like the liver and kidneys as seen in animal studies and the possibility of developing allergies due to the insertion of foreign genes there is also a concern about antibioticresistant genes transferring to humans or bacteria although the likelihood is low environmental risks involve the accidental harm to nontarget species gene pollution through crosspollination and the emergence of super weeds resistant to herbicides additionally the reduction of crop diversity can make agricultural systems more vulnerable to environmental stresses socioeconomic concerns focus on the monopolization of gm seeds by large corporations forcing farmers to buy seeds annually and the issue of biopiracy where indigenous resources are patented without consent to address these risks gmos undergo strict regulatory approval processes including international agreements like the cartagena protocol and national frameworks like sri lankas national biosafety framework despite these risks gmos hold significant potential for agriculture and food production
cartagena protocol on biosafety students are not expected to memorize the dates cartagena protocol on biosafety to the convention on biological diversity is an international agreement signed on 15 may of 2000 in montreal canada as a supplement to the convention on biological diversity cbd signed in 1992 at the rio earth summit and is effective from 1993 cartagena protocol on biosafety came into effect from 11 september of 2003 it is called cartagena protocol on biosafety since it had been originally scheduled to sign in cartagena in colombia the provisions in cbd were not sufficient to cover many aspects in biodiversity related to the gmos the number of signatories to the cartagena protocol has exceeded 100 this includes sri lanka which gave formal consent to the protocol on 28 april of 2004 the aim of the cartagena protocol on biosafety is to protect the biological diversity from the potential risks caused by genetically modified organisms or living modified organisms lmos created as a result of modern biotechnology cbd defined biotechnology as any technology that uses biological systems living organisms or derivatives thereof to make or modify products or processes for specific use the protocol is based on precautionary principle of cbd so that products of new biotechnologies should follow rigorous control measures to avoid any potential risk to the environment or human health and is applied to transboundary movement transit handling and use of lmos that may have adverse effect on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity this also applies to risks to human health the provisions of the protocol are intended to allow developing nations to balance public health against economic benefits countries and states may take appropriate actions to limit entering of an lmo to their territory if they feel that there is lack of scientific information to ensure that the lmo is safe on environment or human health the lmos maybe intended to be introduced into the environment or to be used as food or feed the shipment should accompany with appropriate documentation which identify the lmo and whom to contact for further information sufficient information should be supplied by the importer or exporter to the importing party to arrive at an informed decision on accepting or rejecting the lmo imports and how to handle them in a safe manner the protocol established a biosafety clearing house bch to assist parties to implement the protocol by facilitation exchange of scientific technical environmental and legal information on and experience with movement of lmos sri lanka signed the protocol in may 2000 and it is in force in sri lanka from july 2004 ministry of environment and natural resources was identified as the responsible institution for coordinating the activities related to the protocol national biosafety framework of sri lanka students are not expected to memorize the dates the drafting of the national biosafety framework of sri lanka nbfsl was completed in 2005 by ministry of environment and natural resources now ministry of mahaweli development and environment momde this is based on a precautionary approach in accordance with cartagena protocol on biosafety with the objective of ensuring that the risks likely to be caused by modern biotechnology and its products will be minimized and biodiversity human health and environment will be protected in a maximum way regulating the transboundary movements through formulation of relevant policies regulations technical guidelines and establishment of management bodies and supervisory mechanisms national biosafety framework of sri lanka is the starting point for a permanent legislative framework on biosafety in sri lanka based on the nbfsl two policies have been formulated national biosafety policy 2005 is one of those the policy on biosafety sets the overall framework in which adequate safety measures will be developed and put into force to minimize possible risks to human health and the environment while extracting maximum benefits from any potential that modern biotechnology may offer a national policy on access to biological resources sustainable use and benefit sharing has been formulated in 2013 by momde with the goal of ensuring conservation and sustainable use of biological resources and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from them in accordance with cartagena protocol on biosafety and the national biosafety framework of sri lanka however these policies have not yet been enacted by law the target 12 of the national biodiversity strategic action plan for 20162022 of biodiversity secretariat of the momde states that by 2022 biosafety is assured the actions to be taken in this direction are 1 strengthening policy on biosafety 2 implementing biosafety master plan and formulate biosafety legislature 3 strengthening risk assessment procedures for new technologies 4 strengthening capacity for risk assessment 5 developing and implementing legal instruments to protect native biodiversity and indigenous crops from contamination from gmos and 6 enhancing sri lankas scientific capacity on biosafety,the cartagena protocol on biosafety is an international agreement designed to protect biodiversity from the potential risks posed by genetically modified organisms gmos and living modified organisms lmos produced through modern biotechnology signed in 2000 as part of the convention on biological diversity cbd the protocol emphasizes the precautionary principle ensuring that new biotechnologies are rigorously controlled to prevent harm to the environment or human health it regulates the transboundary movement of lmos allowing countries to refuse lmo imports if safety information is insufficient the biosafety clearing house bch was established to facilitate the exchange of scientific and legal information on lmos sri lanka signed the protocol in 2000 and implemented the national biosafety framework nbfsl in 2005 this framework aims to minimize risks associated with biotechnology through policies and regulations the national biodiversity strategic action plan 20162022 outlines goals such as strengthening biosafety policies creating legal instruments to protect biodiversity from gmo contamination and enhancing scientific capacity for risk assessment
what is environment the environment is the complex of physical chemical and biotic factors that act upon an organism or an ecological community and ultimately determine its form and survival what is environmental biology definition a scientific study of the origins functions relationships interactions and natural history of living populations communities species and ecosystems in relation to dynamic environmental processes in other words environmental biology is the study of different biological components of the environment and its relationship with each other and with the abiotic components why learn environmental biology by learning of environmental biology will be able to understand the structure and the functions of the environment we live in specifically to understand how biotic and abiotic components of the environment are linked and interact with each other recognize organizational levels of the environment learn about major processes of an ecosystem recognize different components offer retrial and aquatic ecosystems under stand how human activities are altering ecological systems and understand how natural changes in the environment such as climate change flooding erosion etc affect species and habitats organizational levels of the environment several levels of organization are recognized by environmental biologists levels of organization include the individualorganism population community ecosystem and biosphere individual organism the first level is an individual an individual is any organism or living thing an organism has its own characters in physiology evolution and behavior in relation to environmental factors population a group of individuals of the same species living in the same area and producing fertile offspring through interbreeding community a collection of populations of different species living in the same area interacting with each other ecosystem an ecosystem is a collection of communities as well as the abiotic factors with which they interact biosphere includes the entire portion of earth that is inhabited by life,environmental biology is the study of how living organisms interact with each other and with the physical and chemical components of their environment this field helps us understand the structure and functions of ecosystems how biotic living and abiotic nonliving components are interconnected and how natural and humaninduced changes such as climate change impact species and habitats it also covers organizational levels of the environment starting from the individual organism followed by populations groups of the same species communities different species living together ecosystems communities interacting with abiotic factors and the biosphere the global sum of ecosystems learning environmental biology is essential to grasp how ecosystems function and the consequences of altering them
all organisms live in a complex environment that includes several components which are categorized under two major groups abiotic components the nonliving components physical and chemical factors of the environment such as water air light temperature nutrients sunlight soil abiotic resources are usually obtained from the lithosphere atmosphere and hydrosphere abiotic components limit the geographic range distribution and the abundance of species biotic components the living components of the ecosystem which include plants animals fungi bacteria and protists etc structure and function of ecosystems the concept of niche and habitat to understand how an ecosystem work one should first look into the concepts of niche and habitat niche a niche is the role that a particular organism plays in the ecosystem each organism plays a particular role in its ecosystem in other words a niche is how an organism makes its living this involves how the organism gets its energy which usually has to do with what an organism eats and how the organism passes that energy through the ecosystem an organisms niche also includes how the organism interacts with other organisms its role in recycling nutrients tolerance to environment conditions such as temperature soil moisture etc therefore niche of an organism describes what it needs to live and what it does in a particular ecosystem habitat the habitat is the physical area where a species lives many environment factors are used to describe a habitat the average amount of sunlight received each day the range of annual temperatures and average yearly annual rainfall describe a habitat these and other abiotic factors of the environment such as soil condition will determine the kind of traits an organism must have in order to survive there a habitat should not be confused with an ecosystem the habitat is the actual place of the ecosystem whereas the ecosystem includes both the biotic and abiotic factors of the habitat interactions between abiotic and biotic components of the environment there are different types of interactions in an ecosystem they are bioticbiotic interactions eg competition feeding relationships symbiotic relationships between individuals and species bioticabiotic interactions eg water uptake of plants from soil abioticabiotic interactionseg chemical reactions occurring in the soil feeding relationships within an ecosystem develop food webs and food chains through which energy is passed from one organism to another energy transfer in an ecosystem the main energy provider for the earth is the sun using sunlight the green plants produce their own energy and store in tissues the source of energy required by all living organisms is the chemical energy of their food ultimately chemical energy in any organism is obtained by the conversion of the radiant energy of sun which are stored in tissues of plants and animals trophic level the producers and consumers in ecosystem can be arranged into several feeding groups each known as trophic level feeding level in any ecosystem producers represent the first trophic level herbivores represent the second trophic level primary carnivores represent the third trophic level and top carnivores represent other levels,organisms live in complex environments composed of abiotic nonliving components like water light temperature and soil and biotic living components like plants animals and microbes these factors influence the distribution and survival of species understanding the structure and function of ecosystems involves concepts like niche which refers to the role an organism plays in its ecosystem and habitat the physical area where a species lives interactions between abiotic and biotic factors are crucial for ecosystem dynamics including bioticabiotic interactions eg water uptake by plants and bioticbiotic interactions eg competition energy flows through ecosystems via food chains and food webs starting with producers plants that capture solar energy organisms are grouped into trophic levels based on their feeding roles from producers to top carnivores
a food chain is a linear sequence of organisms through which nutrients and energy pass from one trophic level to another trophic level of an ecosystem beginning with a primary producer lets look at the parts of a typical food chain starting from the bottom the producers and moving upwards as primary consumers secondary consumers and tertiary consumers primary producers at the first trophic level of the food chain lie the primary producers the primary producers are autotrophs and are most often photosynthetic organisms such as plants algae or cyanobacteria these organisms convert light energy to chemical energy or in another words produce organic matter the organisms that consume eat the primary producers are called primary consumers primary consumers are usually herbivores planteaters though they may be algae eaters or bacteria eaters the organisms that consume the primary consumers are called secondary consumers secondary consumers are generally carnivores meateaters the organisms that consume the secondary consumers are called tertiary consumers these are carnivoreeating carnivores such as eagles or big fish species food web in a natural ecosystem isolated food chains do not exists the food chains are interconnected with each other to form food webs the food web is an interconnected feeding relationships in an ecosystem energy loss along food chains the flow of energy along a food chain is always unidirectional at each trophic level in the food chain a considerable fraction about 90 of the potential energy is lost as heat and respiration as a result organisms in each trophic level pass on lesser energy about 10 to the next trophic level than they actually receive this limits the number of trophic levels in any food chain to four or five the most ecologically efficient food chain is the shortest one longer the food chain the lesser energy is available for top members because of this tapering off of available energy in the food chain a pyramid is formed that is known as an ecological pyramid shorter food chain has more energy available even at the highest trophic level than that of longer food chain ecological pyramid the trophic structure of an ecosystem can be indicated by means of ecological pyramid the higher the steps in the ecological pyramid the lower will be the number of individuals and the larger their size the concept of ecological pyramid was developed by charles elton these pyramids are also known as eltonian pyramids the pyramids are a graphical representation which depicts the number of organisms biomass and productivity at each trophic level all ecological pyramids begin at the bottom with the primary producers and they proceed to various trophic levels such as herbivores consume plants carnivores prey on herbivores and so on the highest level is at the top of the food chain there are three types of ecological pyramids pyramid of energy pyramid of numbers pyramid of biomass pyramid of energy pyramid of energy represents the amount of energy at different trophic levels the pyramid of energy or the energy pyramid describes the overall nature of the ecosystem as there is considerable loss of energy during the flow of energy from organism to other the energy pyramid always upright and vertical this pyramid shows the flow of energy at different trophic levels it depicts the energy is minimum as the highest trophic level and is maximum at the lowest trophic level at each trophic level there is successive loss of energy in the form of heat and respiration etc pyramid of numbers the pyramid of numbers depicts the relationship in terms of the number of producers herbivores and the carnivores at their successive trophic levels in most cases there is a gradual decrease in the number of individuals from the lower to the higher trophic levels the number of individuals from the lower to the higher trophic levels the number pyramid varies from ecosystem to ecosystem pyramid of biomass the pyramid of biomass is more fundamental in this pyramid there is a gradual decrease in the biomass from the lower to the higher trophic levels as the fresh weight of biomass contains a larger amount of water dry weight of the biomass represents the amount of energy available in the form of organic matter of an organism,a food chain is a sequence through which nutrients and energy pass from one organism to another in an ecosystem it begins with primary producers such as plants algae or cyanobacteria which use sunlight to create chemical energy these are eaten by primary consumers herbivores which are in turn consumed by secondary consumers carnivores and at the top are tertiary consumers carnivoreeating carnivores like eagles in natural ecosystems multiple food chains are interconnected forming complex food webs energy transfer in ecosystems is inefficient with about 90 of energy lost as heat or through respiration at each trophic level leaving only about 10 for the next level this limits food chains to 45 trophic levels the decreasing energy creates ecological pyramids pyramid of energy shows energy flow through trophic levels and is always upright reflecting energy loss pyramid of numbers illustrates the decreasing population size at higher trophic levels pyramid of biomass shows the decline in biomass as you move up the trophic levels these pyramids highlight how ecosystems are structured and why shorter food chains are more energyefficient
the materials available for living organisms in the ecosystem is limited therefore these materials should be recycled the material stock in the ecosystem is decreased when the organisms such as animals plants etc utilize them therefore when the organism is died they are decomposed by decomposers thus those materials will be available for the organisms and absorb them into their body assimilate and the excess will be removed as waste materials to the environment what is a biome a biome is a large geographical area which is classified based on the predominant vegetation adapted to that particular environment the climate and geography of a region determines what type of biome can exist in that region each biome consists of many ecosystems whose communities have adapted to the small differences in climate topography and soil conditions within the biome major terrestrial biomes include tropical forest savanna desert chaparral temperate grassland temperate broad leaf forest northern coniferous forest and tundra 1 tropical forests this biome is distributed close to the equator and extends to the sub equatorial areas therefore both tropical rainforests and tropical dry forests are included the average annual rainfall in tropical rain forests is about 2000 4000 mm and in tropical dry forests it is about 1500 2000 mm seasonal rainfall with a dry season of 67 months is prominent in the dry forests and a fairly constant rainy season is prominent in the rainforests tropical rainforests have an average temperature of 25 29 c whereas in the tropical dry forests it may reach up to 33 c in tropical rainforests an emergent layer canopy and sub canopy layers are visible these are followed by an understory layer which consists of shrubs and large herbaceous plants the forest floor consists of small herbaceous plants mushrooms and a thick layer of dried plant litter therefore the vegetation is arranged in several vertical layers and stratification is observed evergreens are prominent in tropical rain forests whereas in dry forests leaves of deciduous species fall in the dry season epiphytes are common in this biome however in dry forests they are less common shrubs with thorns as well as succulent plants often occur in dry forests tropical forests constitute the higher diversity of plants and animals out of all terrestrial biomes it has many mammal species and 530 million species of arthropods some of which have not been fully described yet animals in this biome have adaptations to suit the environment animals in the rainforests show year round activity camouflage is common among small animals large animals may have markings in their bodies birds often migrate to other regions during dry period human involvement in agriculture and development related activities has led to destruction of these forests 2 savanna savanna is spread close to the equator and subequatorial areas the average annual rainfall in this biome is around 300500 mm a prolonged dry season of approximately 89 months is prominent the average temperature range is 24 29 c however in subequatorial areas seasonal variations may occur savannas are characterized by a landscape that supports scattered trees in a tall grass cover during dry periods the dried grasses catch fire easily therefore grasses adapted to withstand drought naturally grow in savannas these grasses have a very good underground connectivity the few herbs found among grass cover contain small leaves to reduce transpiration and thorns to be protected from herbivores seasonal rains encourage a fresh growth of grasses to compensate the loss of biomass due to consumption by herbivores many insects mainly termites lions zebras ed are the common animals in this region many animals have effective locomotion for long distance migration and long range vision for figure 89 a savanna hunting human settlement from a very early time has been reported in these areas due to rearing of cattle and hunting of animals by humans the population of mammals have been decreased fires caused by human aid help to maintain the grass cover of this biome in one way but it may also have a negative impact by suppressing the growth of trees 3 desert desert is a temperate or tropical biome commonly occurring near 30 north and south latitudes eg sahara and in the center of continents eg gobi desert in north central asia the distribution of this biome is determined by the non availability of water such as in areas with annual average rainfall is less than 300 mm per year the temperature varies seasonally and daily and exceeds 50 c in hot deserts while in cold deserts it drops below 30 c deserts have more bare lands if the vegetation is found they are sparse and widely scattered desert plants have several adaptations to withstand the high temperature and scarcity of water succulent plant body eg cacti and euphorbs most plants have c pathway of photosysnthesis deep roots in shrubs ability to tolerate heat and desiccation reduced surface area of leaves presence of spines thorns presence of toxins in leaves nocturnal animal species are abundant in deserts water conservation is a prominent feature with some species surviving solely on water obtained during the breaking down of carbohydrates in seeds animals include snakes lizards beetles ants scorpions rodents and birds compared to other biomes desserts relatively escape from disturbances due to human activities as these areas experience extreme temperatures and contain limited water,in ecosystems limited materials are recycled after organisms die through the action of decomposers making nutrients available for reuse a biome is a large geographical area defined by its climate and vegetation major biomes include tropical forests savannas and deserts each with unique characteristics tropical forests found near the equator receive high rainfall and have a diverse range of plant and animal species vegetation is stratified into different layers including emergent canopy and understory rainforests are rich in biodiversity with epiphytes and evergreen species being common savannas are characterized by scattered trees and tall grasses they experience prolonged dry seasons and frequent fires with herbivores and carnivores like zebras and lions being common deserts are marked by extreme temperatures and low rainfall with plants like cacti and animals such as snakes and beetles adapted for water conservation and survival in harsh conditions each biome has adapted to its environment and human activities like agriculture and settlement have impacted their stability particularly in tropical forests and savannas
4chaparral chaparral occurs in mid latitude coastal regions such as north america chilie spain southern france and south africa chaparral is best developed in southern california chaparrals receive an average annual rainfall of 300500 mm they experience rainy winters and dry summer the average temperature is between 10 to 12 c but can reach up to 40 c the chaparral biome is typically composed of dwarf forests and shrubs and interspersed herbaceous vegetation which include grasses and herbs chaparral is highly prone to events of catastrophic wildfire therefore plants show the some of the following adaptations seed germination occurring only after a hot fire fire resistant roots uses of food stored in the fire resistant roots for resprouting after a fire quick re sprouting of the mother plant enables usage of nutrients released by the fire tough evergreen leaves in woody plants to survive in droughts most of the native mammals in chaparrals are browsers they include deers and goats chaparrals are rich in diversity of small mammals and several species of amphibians birds reptiles and insects these areas have been reduced and disturbed due to human settlement urbanization and agricultural conversions chaparral is vulnerable to fire caused by human activities 5 temperate grasslands these grasslands occur under temperate climatic regimes that are intermediate to those that support forest and desert grasslands in north america are called prairie they are often called steppe in eurasia and called pampas in argentina precipitation is highly seasonal with periodic drought these grasslands have relatively dry winters and wet summers the average rainfall is 300 to 1000 mm per year during winter seasons the average temperature falls below 10 c and in summer it is about 30c grasses are the dominant plant species in these grasslands the prairie is often divided into three types according to height of the dominant vegetationtallgrass mixedgrass and shortgrass the height of grasses vary from few centimeters to two meters in tall grass pairrie fire and droughts are occurred in these grasslands but many plants growing in those areas have adaptations to cope with fire large grazers such as horses and many types of burrowing mammals prairie dogs in north america are found in these areas the tallgrass prairie is now an endangered natural ecosystem because it has been almost entirely converted to agriculture and farmlands 6temperate broadleaf forest distribution of temperate broadleaf forests are at mid latitudes in the northern hemisphere the average annual precipitation is between 700 to2000 mm significant amount of precipitation is received throughout the year in summer as rain and in winter as snow average temperature during winter is zero while in summer it is up to 35 c summer is hot and humid and allow a favourable time to the growth of trees the dominant trees are mostly deciduous a vertical layering stratification can be seen in temperate broadleaf forests they are closed canopy layer one or two strata of understory trees shrub layer and herb layer there are only few epiphytes can be found many mammals can be seen and they hibernate during winter seasons while the birds species migrate to are as where climate is warmer precipitation is highly seasonal with periodic drought these grasslands have relatively dry winters and wet summers the average rainfall is 300 to 1000 mm per year during winter seasons the average temperature falls below 10 c and in summer it is about 30c grasses are the dominant plant species in these grasslands the prairie is often divided into three types according to height of the dominant vegetationtallgrass mixedgrass and shortgrass the height of grasses vary from few centimeters to two meters in tall grass prairie fire and droughts are occurred in these grasslands but many plants growing in those areas have adaptations to cope with fire large grazers such as horses and many types of burrowing mammals prairie dogs in north america are found in these areas the tallgrass prairie is now an endangered natural ecosystem because it has been almost entirely converted to agriculture and farmlands 6 temperate broadleaf forest distribution of temperate broadleaf forests are at mid latitudes in the northern hemisphere the average annual precipitation is between 700 to 2000 mm significant amount of precipitation is received throughout the year in summer as rain and in winter as snow average temperature during winter is zero while in summer it is up to 35 c summer is hot and humid and allow a favourable time to the growth of trees the dominant trees are mostly deciduous a vertical layering stratification can be seen in temperate broadleaf forests they are closed canopy layer one or two strata of understory trees shrub layer and herb layer there are only few epiphytes can be found many mammals can be seen and they hibernate during winter seasons while the birds species migrate to areas where climate is warmer forests are disturbed due to logging clearance for agriculture and for human settlements 7 northern coniferous forest the largest biome on earth is the northern coniferous forest it is extended as a broad band from upper band of arctic tundra precipitation annual average precipitation 1s around 300 700 mm and a periodic drought is also common the temperature is 50 c in winter and 20 c in summer the northern forest is dominated by coniferous trees eg fir pine spruce are common tree species many conifers are conical in shape and this shape of trees prevents accumulation of snow thus preventing the breaking down of branches they have needle like leaves that prevent high transpiration the diversity of shrubs and herbs in these forests is less than that of temperate broad leaf forests because of the limitations in precipitation and warm temperature commonly found mammals are brown bears moose and siberan tigers during some period of time dominant plants can be killed by sudden attacks of insects these areas are not heavily populated by humans but logging is a severe threat 8 tundra this biome covers expansive areas of the arctic region amounting 20 of earths land surface alpine tundra occurs at high altitudes on mountains while arctic tundra occurs at high latitudes most tundras receive very small inputs of water as precipitation but nevertheless their soil may be moist or wet because there is little evaporation in such cold climates and deep drainage may be prevented by frozen soil the arctic tundra annually receive an average precipitation around 200 to 600 mm and the alpine tundra receives 1000 mm precipitation respectively during the winter time temperature falls below 30 c and during the summer temperature it is always less than 10 c mostly herbaceous plants can be seen that includes different types of grasses and forbs shrubs mosses lichens and trees also can be found in tundra a layer of permafrost which is a permanently frozen layer of soil can be seen this permafrost layer restrict the growth of the roots of plants large grazing mammals such as caribou and reindeer migratory musk oxen resident and predatory wolves foxes bears together with many species of migratory birds that nest during summer can be seen in this biome this area is sparsely colonized by humans but heavily used for extraction of minerals and oils,biomes are large geographical areas characterized by distinct climates vegetation and ecosystems key biomes include chaparral found in midlatitude coastal regions chaparral receives 300500 mm of rain annually with wet winters and dry summers it consists of shrubs and herbaceous plants adapted to wildfire such as fireresistant roots and quick resprouting capabilities this biome supports diverse species like deer and small mammals but faces threats from human activities temperate grasslands known as prairies in north america these grasslands experience seasonal droughts and average rainfall between 3001000 mm dominated by grasses they are home to large grazers like horses and burrowing mammals however extensive agriculture has endangered tallgrass prairies temperate broadleaf forests located in midlatitudes these forests receive 7002000 mm of precipitation annually and have distinct seasonal temperature variations they are characterized by deciduous trees and rich biodiversity but human activities such as logging threaten their health northern coniferous forests the largest biome it spans the upper arctic tundra with an average of 300700 mm of precipitation dominated by coniferous trees this biome supports species like bears and tigers but logging poses a significant threat tundra covering 20 of earths land tundra experiences harsh conditions with less than 10c in summer and below 30c in winter characterized by permafrost this biome supports migratory animals like caribou and a variety of herbaceous plants each biome faces environmental challenges and human impacts highlighting the need for conservation
sri lanka is in the northequatorial tropical zone therefore it experiences a climate with high rainfall and temperature which permits the country to be blessed with a wide array of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems the ecosystems can be broadly classified into groups as follows 1 terrestrial eco systems a forestslowland rain forests dry monsoon forests montane forests thorn scrubs b grasslands savanna patana 2 inland wetland ecosystems rivers and streams reservoirs marshes and swamps villus 3 ecosystems is with coastal areas lagoons and estuaries mangroves coral reefs sea shore sand dunes sea grass beds salt marshes the distribution of major vegetation types may be considered as broadly linked to the local climate mainly rain fall and temperature topography and the edaphic soil conditions a broad classification of major ecosystems of sri lanka is given below classification of eco systems in sri lanka arid zone temperature t 3236c rainfall r 1000 mm altitude alt 300 m forests

tropical submontane forests o 1500 m tropical montane forests grasslands talawa dry patana wet patana tropical wet low land rainforests the tropical wet lowland rainforests are found below 900 m elevation in the south western quarter of the country the mean annual temperature is about 28 c and the mean annual rainfalls varies between 2000 mm 5000 mm in different locations without any dry period the humidity is very high these forests are characterized by a tall canopy sub canopy and a sparse shrub layer consisting mostly of the saplings of canopy trees sometimes an emergent layer is also seen above the canopy the vegetation is filled with a network of woody lianas that reach to the canopy layer a diverse population of epiphytic lichens mosses liverworts ferns orchids are found while many fungi inhabit decaying woods and soil high endemism of floral and faunal diversity can be seen in these forests eg sinharaja nakiyadeniya and kanneliya are some examples of wet lowlands rainforests these forests are disturbed due to expansion of tea cultivation agriculture industrial and residential development some tree species found in wet lowland rain forests are s hora t ennai dipterocarpus zeylanicus snaat nagai mesua ferrea s hal tkungiliyam pinai vateria copallifera some animal species found in the wet lowland rainforests are purple faced langur sri lanka slender loris golden wet zone palm civet tropical montane forests they occur at elevation beyond 1500 m above mean sea level the average temperature is about 16 c and rainfall is about 2000 mm without any dry period the humidity is high as lowland rain forests these forests are characterized by a short canopy of about 13 m with a dense shrub layer there are trees with umbrella shaped rounded crowns and twisted branches having leathery small leaves to accommodate the strong winds that prevail in the montane zone high density of epiphytes cover the branches and stems of trees some plants found in these forests are s keena t pongu callophyllum walkeri s walkurudu t kaatu karuwa cinnamomum ovalifolium s gal weralu e wild olive eaeocarpus montanus some animals that inhabit montane rainforests of sri lanka are sri lanka yellow eared bulbul sri lanka highland shrew sambar montane forests are distributed in central hills including knuckles range piduruthalagala hakgala montane forests were greatly affected due to tea cultivation,sri lanka situated in the northequatorial tropical zone boasts diverse ecosystems due to its high rainfall and temperatures the ecosystems can be broadly classified into three categories terrestrial ecosystems these include various forests lowland rainforests dry monsoon forests montane forests and grasslands savanna patana inland wetland ecosystems this encompasses rivers streams reservoirs marshes and swamps coastal ecosystems comprising lagoons estuaries mangroves coral reefs seashores sand dunes sea grass beds and salt marshes sri lankas ecosystems are influenced by climate topography and soil conditions major zones include arid zone characterized by tropical thorn scrubs and salt marshes with temperatures of 3236c dry zone home to tropical dry mixed evergreen forests and grasslands with temperatures of 2832c intermediate zone features tropical moist evergreen forests with temperatures of 2428c wet zone contains tropical lowland submontane and montane forests thriving in temperatures of 1628c tropical wet lowland rainforests are noted for their high biodiversity humidity and species such as the purplefaced langur tropical montane forests at higher elevations exhibit unique flora and fauna adapting to strong winds and cooler temperatures both forest types face threats from agricultural expansion and development
tropical dry mixed evergreen forestsdry monsoon forests these forests have mean annual temperature of about 29 c and rainfall around 1000 mm 1500 mm most of which falls during the northeast monsoon periods there is a marked dry spell from may to august above forests are distributed in areas below 300m altitude these forests are characterized by having sparse canopy a sub canopy and a welldeveloped shrubherb layer some plant species naturally found in these forests are s weera t virai drypetes sepiaraia e s palu t paalai manilkara hexandra e s kaluwara t karunkaali diospyros ebenum some of the canopy trees are deciduous during the dry spell of the year these forests harbor the largest elephant populations in asia the mammal fauna includes leopard bear deer most of the forests are protected as national parks such as yala national park wilpattu national park wasgamuwa national park maduruoya national park ritigala strict nature reserve and many sanctuaries and forest reserves these forests are disturbed by chena cultivation human settlements extraction of timber poaching etc tropical thorn scrubs these are called scrubs than forests as large trees are sparse and the vegetation mainly consists of thorny shrubs they are found in arid lowlands the mean annual temperature is around 34 c and rainfall is below 1000 mm with a longer dry period the following plant species are commonly found gini andara tvindattai dichrostachys cineria s ranawara t avaram poo cassia auriculata s heeressa t pirandai cissus quadrangularis due to the dry conditions many fauna species cannot be found however deer leopard elephants can be seen in these areas they are distributed near hambantota yala mannar puttalam areas and disturbed due to various development pressures savanna savannas have a thick grass cover and few scattered trees these are common on hill slopes of the dry or intermediate zone the thin layer of soil on hill slopes cannot support the growth of trees and the grass cover of savannas helps to bind soil particles and reduce erosion of soil periodic fires are common to this ecosystem as the fried grass cover easily catch fire in dry period of the year they have trees with fire resistant species some plant species found in savanna are trees are saralu t kadukkay zerminalia chebula s nelli t topu nelli payllanthus emblica sbulu t adhan koddai tanti zerminalia bellirica and have grass species such as s mana e citronella grass vasanai pullu t cymbopogon nardus s iluk e cogon grass ttharpai pullu jmperata cylindrica savannas are seen in bibile monaragala mahiyanganaya wellawaya areas these are disturbed by periodic fires set by villagers for various reasons patana there are two types of patana found in sri lanka wet patana grassland and dry patana grassland based on the rainfall pattern and soil of the site wet patana grasslands are found in areas above 1500 m from the sea level with mean annual rainfall of over 2000 mm temperature ranges from 5c to 18 c mist fog and frost are common in these areas and do not experience any dry period the grasses do not reach more than one meter height and are called tussock grasses which include the chrysopogon nodulibarbis and arundinella villosa the animals include a large sambar and wild boare populations and few leopards extensive wet patana are found only in horton plains dry patana grasslands are found in altitudes between 500 m to 1500 m they receive a rainfall about 1250 mm to 2000 mm with a definite dry period temperature ranges from 18 c to 24 c the vegetation is made up of grasses that grow up to 12 m height such as pangiri mana cymbopogon nardus and themeda pini bara tana themeda tremula dry patana is common on hill tops in in hantana gampola welimada and haputale wetlands wetlands are simply habitats with permanent or temporary accumulation of water with associated plant and animals according to ramsar convention wetlands are defined as areas of marsh fen peatland or water whether natural or artificial permanent or temporary with water that is static or flowing fresh brackish or salt including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide not exceed six metres the wetlands of sri lanka which fit into the ramsar definition can be divided into three broad categories inland fresh water wetlands eg rivers stream marshes swamp forests and villus coastal wetlands eg lagoons estuaries mangroves sea grass beds salt marshes and coral reefs manmade wetlands eg tanks reservoirs rice fields and salterns rivers and streams sri lanka has an extensive network of rivers which drains a total of 103 distinct natural river basins the river basins originating in the wet highlands are perennial while many of those in dry zone are seasonal there is hardly any vegetation to be found in running water wetlands wetlands are simply habitats with permanent or temporary accumulation of water with associated plant and animals according to ramsar

mean annual temperature of about 29c and receive 10001500 mm of rainfall primarily during the northeast monsoon these forests found below 300 meters in altitude feature a sparse canopy a subcanopy and a welldeveloped shrub layer hosting diverse flora including species like weera drypetes sepiaraia and palu manilkara hexandra these forests are vital habitats for the largest elephant populations in asia alongside leopards and bears tropical thorn scrubs consist mainly of thorny shrubs in arid lowlands with temperatures around 34c and rainfall below 1000 mm species such as gini andara dichrostachys cineria thrive in these conditions though animal diversity is limited savannas feature thick grass cover and few trees common in hilly dry or intermediate zones which helps prevent soil erosion patana grasslands are classified as wet and dry based on rainfall and altitude supporting unique grass species and wildlife wetlands in sri lanka include freshwater and coastal ecosystems vital for biodiversity the ramsar convention defines wetlands as areas with accumulated water crucial for various plant and animal species coral reefs along the southern coast are biologically rich showcasing high diversity and productivity often referred to as the rainforests of the sea

definitions biodiversity includes all forms of life on earth biodiversity is the variability among living organisms from all sources including terrestrial marine and other aquatic ecosystems and their ecological interactions with the environment biodiversity is explained under three levels they are genetic diversity species diversity and ecosystem diversity genetic diversity the basic component of biological diversity is the genetic variation that exists both within and among species this genetic variation is the basis for evolution b species diversity this is simply the variation that can be recognized among different species it includes the number of species species richness and their abundance c ecosystem diversity is the variety of habitats living communities and ecological processes in the living world ecosystem diversity is the largest cale of biodiversity and with in each ecosystem there isa great deal of both species and genetic diversity in cooperated ecosystem diversity on a global scale would be the variation in ecosystems in large regions biomes such as deserts forests grasslands wetlands and oceans whereas in smaller localized regions it can be explained by means of different ecosystems the importance and values of biodiversity the individual components of biodiversitygenes species and ecosystems provide the human society with a wide array of goods and services genes species and ecosystems of direct indirect or potential use to humanity are often referred to as biological resources genes are used by plant breeders to develop new crop varieties many species are used as various foods medicines fibers fuels and industrial products this include food resources like grains vegetables fruits which are obtained from plant resources and meat fish egg milk and milk products from animal resources the biodiversity products can be harvested and consumed directly without passing through a formal market non commercial goods example fruits fish edible roots leaves nuts flowers meat animal product like milk and honey timber firewood fiber wool wax resin rubber silk and decorative items and traditional medicines etc some products can be harvested and available through a formal market commercial goods many industries such as food textile leather silk paper pulp are based on the direct use of biological resources the ecosystems provide many services to us such as air and water purification erosion prevention and flood control therefore the value of biodiversity is explained through its goods and services provided to humanity and sustenance of the environment environmental service value this is the most important services provided by biodiversity in maintaining critical environmental functions eg carbon dioxide fixation through photosynthesis maintaining of essential nutrition cycles maintaining water cycle and recharging of ground water soil formation and protection from erosion regulating climate by recycling moisture into the atmosphere water purification pollination etc recreational value there is a great aesthetic value provided by biodiversity natural landscapes at undisturbed places are a delight to watch and also provide opportunities for recreational activities and hobbies such as bird watching photography etc biodiversity provides inspiration in artistic activities like poetry painting dance etc it promotes ecotourism helps to generate revenue by designing of zoological botanical gardens national parks etc ethical value this is the right of all living beings to live on this planet humans have no right to decide which species should exist since we are just a small part of the greater creation of nature educationalscientific value knowledge about biodiversity helps in new scientific discoveries and technological innovations to find solutions to the problems we face today eg learning of other animals like nematodes rats and primates has helped in understanding human body and development of medicines knowledge about how animals react before a natural disaster is helpful in disaster management interacting with biodiversity is proven to be helpful in developing creativity relieving stress and development of personality socialculturalreligious values biodiversity can be important to different societies and communities due to unique reasons eg some wetland sites are sacred to aborigines of australia twenty eight species of trees are sacred for buddhists bulls are considered to be an important part of hindu culture,biodiversity refers to the variety of life on earth and encompasses the variability among living organisms across different ecosystems categorized into three levels genetic diversity variation within species species diversity the number and abundance of species and ecosystem diversity variety of habitats and ecological processes biodiversity is crucial for human survival offering a wide range of goods and services referred to as biological resources including food and medicine various plants and animals provide essential nutrients and medicinal compounds environmental services biodiversity maintains critical ecological functions such as air and water purification climate regulation and nutrient cycling recreational value natural landscapes inspire artistic expression and provide opportunities for activities like birdwatching and ecotourism ethical value all living beings have the right to exist emphasizing the moral obligation to protect biodiversity educational value understanding biodiversity leads to scientific advancements and innovations in summary biodiversity is integral to ecosystem health and human wellbeing providing essential resources and services that sustain life
animal and plant species die off all the time its how the biological world rolls however things have changed dramatically in recent decades according to some scientists earth is currently in the midst of its sixth mass extinction the last major extinction occurred some 65 million years ago when a large asteroid slammed off the coast of mexico killing off the dinosaurs and most everything else today scientists say the extinction rate is as much as 1000 times faster than what should be natural rate would be this is solely because of the very high and negative impact of humans on biodiversity due to high population and development virtually all of earths ecosystems have been dramatically transformed through human actions for example many mangrove and coral reef areas have been lost within groups of conifers cycads amphibians birds and mammals up to 50 of species are threatened with extinction according to the iucn red list within many species groups such as amphibians african mammals and birds in agricultural lands the majority of species have faced a decline in the size of their population in their geographical spread or both threats to biodiversity habitat lossfragmentation humans supplant natural ecosystems to grow food harvest materials and build our settlements these actions alter or eliminate the conditions needed for plants and animals to survive when natural habitats are converted into other human uses such as agriculture or built up area they are no longer able to support the species present in the original habitat this result in the displacement or destruction of biodiversity eg deforestation filling of wetlands mass scale destruction of mangrove in lagoons such as negambo and puttalam due to establishment of prawn culture destructed the biodiversity of mangroves in these areas when habitats are divided into fragments due to establishment of man built structures such as roads the animals and plant species are forced to occupy smaller area in a crowded manner which is harder for biodiversity to sustain as in previous habitat conditions overexploitation harvesting or exploiting biodiversity products in a manner and a rate which it cannot recover within the periods of exploitation leads to danger of biodiversity being completely lost eg over collection of indigenous medicinal plants from forests in sri lanka for export such as kotalahimbutu s salacia reticulata export of sea cucumber for medicinal purposes from sri lankan shores ebonyekaluwara s karunkaali t diospyrus ebanum is threatened due to over exploitation during the colonial period ebony has a very slow growth rate and take many years to grow intense commercial fishing has led to over fishing threatening decline of food fish like tuna and cod in worlds oceans pollution pollution simply means addition of unwanted materials to air water soil due to extensive use of agrochemicals that wash away with rain water into the water bodies make the water rich in nutrients eutrophication resulting in algal blooms algal blooms create oxygen depleted zone in aquatic ecosystems and greatly reduce the populations of fish and other aquatic species uses of synthetic fertilizers for tea in montane areas also has resulted pollution of rivers in many down stream areas affecting the water quality and making it unsuitable for human use releasing of sulphur dioxide so and nitrous oxide no gasses react with water and make the rain water acidic resulting acid rains acid rains caused by air pollution contributes to the death of trees killing many buds leaves and the seedlings and causing damage to the plant roots introduction of invasive alien species invasive alien species are alien exotic plants andor animals whose introduction and spread outside their natural geographic range threaten native biodiversity alien invasive species compete against or prey on native species which can lead to their extinction once introduced for a considerable period of time they may lack natural predators in the new environment this is a great opportunity for them to reproduces successfully and spread without limits to take over the environment they can transport disease outcompete native species alter food chains decrease biodiversity and even change ecosystems properties by altering soil composition or creating habitats that encourage wildfires eg alien invasive species such as lantanae gandapana s nayunni tlantana camara does not allow germination and seedling growth of many other plants as it produces toxins which are added to soil through leaf litter

sri lanka has a high degree of endemism sri lanka wet zone of sri lanka together with western ghats of india is considered as one of the biodiversity hot spot in south asian region,earth is currently facing its sixth mass extinction with extinction rates up to 1000 times higher than natural rates largely due to human activities key threats to biodiversity include habitat lossfragmentation human activities such as agriculture and urbanization destroy natural habitats displacing species and disrupting ecosystems overexploitation unsustainable harvesting of resources like medicinal plants and fish threatens their populations and leads to potential extinction pollution the introduction of harmful substances into the environment degrades ecosystems causing issues such as eutrophication and acid rain which harm aquatic and terrestrial life invasive alien species nonnative species such as lantana and guinea grass can outcompete native species disrupt food chains and alter ecosystems leading to biodiversity loss climate change increasing temperatures and extreme weather conditions threaten species unable to adapt quickly leading to further declines in biodiversity biodiversity hotspots like sri lanka and the western ghats of india are regions with high levels of endemic species facing severe threats highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts
existing species have to make room for new species either by changing themselves or by becoming extinct therefore natural extinction has to be recognized as part of the evolutionary process the rate of evolution has been generally higher than that of extinction therefor there has been an increase in biodiversity over time extinction is the elimination of the last member of a species from the earth with the growth of human population and civilization mankind has greatly increased the rate of extinction the earth today is dominated by humans and no ecosystems on earths surface is free from human influence in general it is estimated that about 510 of the species may face extinction within the next 30 years not only a species but also family or genus or a sub species taxon can become extinct if there had been a continuous pressure for its survival the red data book published by the international union for conservation of nature iucn provides a list of threatened species and define extinct and threatened species as follows extinct ex a taxon is extinct when there is no reasonable doubt that the last individual has died eg dodo lived in mauritius wooly mammoth lived in north america legume crudia zeylanica extinct in the wild ew a taxon is extinct in the wild when it is known only to survive in cultivation in captivity or as a naturalized population populations well outside its natural habitat eg giant tortoise of seychelles different categories of threatened organisms a species is said to be threatened when it is about to leave the world threatened organisms are described under three categories critically endangered endangered and vulnerable the red data book has indicated other categories such as nearly threatened least concern etc but these are not considered as a threatened species critically endangered cr a taxon is critically endangered when the best available evidence indicates that it is facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild marbled rock frog edumbara gal para diya madiya s and maha madu s ratchatha madupunai t can be listed as one example to represent animals and plants critically endangered in sri lanka endangered en a taxon is endangered when the best available evidence indicates that it is facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild eg etha aliya s yanai t elephant e wesak orchid set vulnerable vu a taxon is vulnerable when the best available evidence indicates that it is facing a high risk of extinction in the wild punchi lena s duskystriped jungle squirrel e and buttercup e are among the vulnerable species found in sri lanka endemic species an endemic species is a species that is confined to a particular area or country and not found growing naturally anywhere else in the world two examples for plant species endemic to sri lanka are dipterocarpus zeylanicuss hora t ennai garcinia quaesita s goraka t gorakappuli examples of two animal species endemic to sri lanka are puntius nigrofasciatus e black ruby barb s bulathhapaya t veddiyan loris tardigradus e slender loris sunahapuluwa tthevangu indigenous species a plant or animal species that occurs in its historically known natural range and that forms part of the natural biological diversity of a particular geographic area examples from sri lankan indigenous species are lulas snake head e viral t kituls thippilipanai t exotic alien species a species that has been introduced from another geographic region to an area outside its natural range due to human activities the introduction of species can be intentional or accidental the following examples represent examples for intentional and direct introductions accidental introductions are indirect introductions often considered as contaminations of direct introductions tilapia se japan meen t for inland fishery industry rubber se rupper t for plantation industry migratory species migration refers to the act of moving from one place to another in a manner that is seasonally determined and predictable migration takes place so that organisms can avoid unfavorable environmental conditions that limit breeding suduredi horas indian fly catchere

species chosen as a symbol or icon to represent an ecosysteminneedforconservationthesespeciesarechosenfortheirvulnerabilityattractiveness or distinctiveness in order to bring about support and acknowledgement from the public at large thus the concept of a flagship species is that the publicity given to few key species will help the conservation of entire ecosystem and all species contained therein the bengal tiger of india the giant panda of china blue magpie of sri lankansri lanka kehibella t neelavudalperumkuyil are examples keystone species these are species that play very import an role in the stability and functioning of a system if that species is removed the system tends to collapse e g planktons of a pond invasive alien species invasive alien species are alien exotic plants andor animals whose introduction and spread outside their natural geographic range threaten native biodiversity invasive alien species take the advantage of human disturbances in the environment to establish and spread themselves their capability to tolerate wide range of environment conditions and high reproductive output help them to easily and successfully expand their populations although only a small percentage of alien species be come invasive they damage biodiversity ecosystem species and genetic levels in everywhere they invade and alter the services and ecosystem values of the introduced environment therefore invasive alien species are considered as a major cause for depletion of biodiversity and environment degradation the following examples represent invasive alien animal and plant species in sri lanka kalutara golubella s giant african land snail e was introduced to sri lanka as a contamination of soil brought with some other plants the soil contained eggs of the snail japan jabara s water hyacinth e kulavazhai t was introduced to the country in nearly 110 years ago as an ornamental plant not knowing that it will become a serious invader afterwards conservation a principal goal of conservation is to ensure the long term survival of as many species as possible species that are in danger of extinction have to be specially protected and steps should be taken to ensure their continued reproduction and survival conservation can be done in two ways insitu conservation the species is protected and its reproduction facilitated in its natural habitat basically a large enough population and adequate appropriate habitat space has to be ensured eg national parks such as yala and minneriya national parks forest reserves such as kanneliya piduruthalagala exsitu conservation the species is taken out of its natural habitats and looked after in places where its survival and reproduction are ensured zoological gardens and botanical gardens of a country play a key role in exsifu conservation,extinction is a natural part of evolution where species may become extinct to make way for new ones however human activities have significantly accelerated extinction rates with an estimated 510 of species at risk over the next 30 years the red data book published by the international union for conservation of nature iucn categorizes species based on their risk of extinction extinct ex no reasonable doubt that the last individual has died eg dodo woolly mammoth extinct in the wild ew survives only in captivity or outside its natural habitat eg giant tortoise threatened species includes critically endangered cr endangered en and vulnerable vu additionally species can be classified as endemic confined to a specific region indigenous historically native exotic introduced from another area migratory seasonally moving and keystone species vital for ecosystem stability conservation efforts include insitu protection in natural habitats and exsitu protection in controlled environments methods to ensure species survival
definition climate change refers to a significant longterm changes of climate attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc 2011 in the meantime the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc defined the climate change as a statistically significant change in the state of the properties of the climate which persists for an extended period typically decades or longer this definitions refer to any change in climate over time whether due to natural variability or as a result of human activity global warming is the increase the average temperature of the earths surface atmospheric and oceanic temperatures due to enhanced greenhouse effect or greenhouse gasses ghg climate change includes warming and the effects arisen due to warming such as melting glaciers extremes of rains or more frequent drought etc it can say in another way global warming is one symptom of much larger problem of climate change contributing factors on global warming and climate change 1 increase of the emission of co and other greenhouse gasses ghg due to human activities 11 carbon dioxide co is produced by burning of organic matters and it is the most common greenhouse gas to contribute to the global warming and climate change events burning of fossil fuel for running vehicles electricity generation industries etc is the main cause of the emitting of co and burning of forests solid waste are the other main causes contributing the co emission 12 methane ch is another greenhouse gas which has a higher global warming potential main emitting sources are anaerobic decomposing at manure management and waste management cattle farming paddy cultivation and enteric fermentation even though the ch is a greenhouse gas with high global warming potential it is less abundant in the atmosphere compared to co 13 nitrous oxide is no another greenhouse gas also with higher global warming potential which is mainly released as by product of fertilizer production and use other industrial processes the combustion of certain materials biomass nitric acid production and fossil fuel combustion in internal combustion engines nitrous oxide can remain very long time in the atmosphere 14 manmade industrial gases namely perfluorocarbons pfcs hydrofluorocarbons hfcs and sulfur hexafluoride sf are also considered as greenhouse gases with a very high global warming potential 15 black carbon or the carbon particles which are suspended in lower atmosphere also identified as another cause for global warming those particles released as a result of the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and other organic matters these particles are extremely small ranging from 10 um 25 um these black carbon have an enormous ability to absorb heat and it cause to increase the air temperature these particles have ability to absorb heat than co carbon monoxide co nitrogen dioxide no sulfur dioxide so tropospheric ground level ozone o and nitrogen oxides nox are also considered as gases which have indirect radiative forcing effect water vapor nonmethane volatile organic compounds nmvocs and aerosols are also considered as ghgs 2 deforestation and decrease of the vegetation cover of the world deforestation is another main cause for global warming at present the conversion of tropical forest lands to commercial agricultural plantations like palm oil contributes to the mass deforestation all over the world forests remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and fix through photosynthesis carbon sequestration deforestation reduce the carbon sequestration capacity carbon capture on the planet ie soil carbon and increase the atmospheric co concentration 3destroying the large quantity of phytoplankton by uv radiation due to the depletion of the ozone layer this is also similar to deforestation phytoplankton which live in warm seas are very useful to maintain the oxygen and carbon dioxide balance normally the carbon absorption capacity of phytoplankton are higher than terrestrial plants though the phytoplankton are unicellular microscopic organism they have been distributed in large area and they were responsible for the 6070 of absorption of atmospheric carbon due to depletion of the ozone layer uv radiation which comes from sun can destroy this kind of tiny organisms and may cause to reduce the co absorption capacity of oceans and increase the global temperature effects of the global warming and climate change 1 sea level rising scientists predict an increase in sea levels worldwide due to the melting of two massive ice sheets in polar regions and thermal expansion of water however many island nations around the world will experience the effects of sea level rise 2 extreme weather events occurrence of extreme weather events such as prolong drought intensive rainfall and its effects such as floods and landslides and storms have been increased for last decades was considered as a negative impact of climate change it causes loss damages and disasters 3less production of foods threat to food security due to unexpected extreme weather condition the crop production will be getting loss around the world it may be due to heavy rains or the severe droughts 4 degradation of coral reefs the corals bleaching and degradation due to rises in sea temperature is a severe danger for whole ocean ecosystems and many other species which lives on coral reefs for their survival according to the recent reports coral populations will collapse by 2100 due to increased temperatures and ocean acidification and its effects 5 increase the insect population due to increase of the insect population some diseases such as mosquitoborne malaria and dengue will spread than present as well the over growth of the insect populations will be a massive threat to food production 6 loss of biodiversity climate change and global warming may cause reduced biodiversity ecosystems structure will be change and some species may move from their present range of occurrence and may survive while some others will not be able to move and could become extinct ozone layer depletion most ozone particles are concentrated in the region of stratosphere in between 1050 km of the atmosphere and this layer is identified as the ozone layer this is very much important to protect living things from burning from too much ultraviolet uv radiation emitting from the sun naturally the total concentration of ozone in the stratosphere remains relatively constant with the concentration of 300 to 350 dobson units du ozone depletion is described when levels fall below 200 du due to manmade ozone depleting chemicals odcs as in the stratosphere over the south polar region this thinning of the ozone layer refers as ozone hole contribution factors for the ozone layer depletion ozone depletion occurs when the natural balance between the production and destruction of stratospheric ozone is disturbed or lost this is mainly due to chlorine and bromine released from manmade compounds called ozone depleting substance such as cfcs mebr helene and hcfc effects of the ozone layer depletion depletion of the ozone layer in the stratosphere will increase penetration of solar uvb radiation which is likely to have profound impact on human health with potential risks of eye diseases skin cancer and infectious diseases it is a known fact that the physiological and developmental processes of plants are affected by uvb radiation uvb radiation is likely to result in changes in species composition mutation thus altering the biodiversity in different ecosystems it directly destroyed phytoplankton which form the foundation of aquatic food webs in the sea and it cause to reduce the composition of food web in the sea ecosystem uvb can also cause damage to early development stages of fish shrimp crab amphibians and other animals desertification desertification means process of land degradation in arid semiarid and dry subhumid areas resulting from various factors including climatic variations and human activitiesuncounted nations convention to combat desertification paris 1994 contribution factors for desertification the main driving forces of desertification can be separated into climate variations and human activities according to the unccd definition it is known that human activities have a great influence in the climate change and it has caused desertification deforestation is another main factor to decertification because of it is directly influencing to reduce the rainfall precipitation soil humidity and water recharge of underground reservoirs overexploitation of water and soil uncontrolled mining and excessive use of agrochemical products and as well as poor land management practices also caused to desertification effects of the desertification decrease ecosystems services and reduced biodiversity in affected areas decreasing of the vegetation cover induce water scarcity destroys habitats of animal and plant species and reduces agricultural activities mainly the growth of crop species it may effect to the food security of the people as well as for the animals the process of desertification presents a serious impact on the human wellbeing and health of the people living in the areas affected by droughts and land degradation due to the desertification carbon storage capacity of plants and soils will also be reduced in the long run,climate change refers to significant longterm alterations in climate patterns primarily driven by human activities that increase greenhouse gas emissions key greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide co methane ch and nitrous oxide no mainly produced through fossil fuel combustion deforestation and industrial processes global warming is a critical aspect of climate change leading to rising earth temperatures and various serious consequences rising sea levels melting polar ice sheets threaten coastal areas and island nations with flooding extreme weather events increased frequency and intensity of droughts heavy rainfall and storms cause damage and disrupt communities food security risks unpredictable weather patterns negatively impact agricultural yields leading to potential food shortages loss of biodiversity ecosystem disruptions can result in habitat loss forcing species to adapt or face extinction additionally the depletion of the ozone layer primarily due to humanmade chemicals like chlorofluorocarbons cfcs allows harmful uv radiation to penetrate the atmosphere increasing health risks and affecting plant life desertification driven by climate change and deforestation reduces biodiversity and leads to soil degradation and water scarcity further threatening food security
acid rain is one of the most serious global environmental issue which emerged due to air pollution mainly due to sulphur dioxide so and oxides of nitrogen these pollutants are released from anthropogenic activities such as combustion of solid waste fossil fuels in thermal power plants and vehicle engines acid rain is a commonly used term for acid deposition which includes rain snow fog and dry particles that fall from the sky uncontaminated precipitation is also slightly acidic and normal a in water may be about a 56 on the ph scale because carbon dioxide is dissolved and carbonic acid is formed acid rain may show a lesser ph contributing factors of acid rains mainly caused by the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere due to burning of fossil fuels where they are converted into sulfuric and nitric acid respectively effects of the acid rains acid rain directly causes severe damage to building structures and marble statues increases the acidity of fresh water ecosystems such as streams lakes and marshes and it causes to change the structure and the composition of above fresh water ecosystems cause to destroy soil organisms and loss the soil fertility it cause to leach metals such as copper aluminum and some heavy metals such as lead and mercury in the soil and into runoff as well as drinking water acid rain causes significant damage to forests it directly affects trees and other small plants which are important to the ecosystem international agreements and key national legislations the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites1975 the aim of cites is to ensure that international trade of specimens such as horns and skins of wild animals and whole plant or parts of plants does not threaten their survival according to cites the export of some species as listed requires prior permission and presentation of an export permit an export permit shall be granted only if export of that species will not be detrimental to that species survival some examples from sri lanka are skin of sri lankan leopard s kotiya t siruththaipuli plants of cyeas madu s madupanai t conventions related to conservation of the environment convention on biological diversity cbd 1992 the convention on biological diversity cbd known informally as the biodiversity convention addresses all aspects of biodiversity conservation it has three main goals the conservation of biological diversity or biodiversity eg conservation of genetic materials and species and ecosystems the sustainable use of components of biological diversity eg imposing limits to control overexploitation the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from genetic resources eg exchange of genetic material species between countries without conflict the convention on wetlands ramsar convention1971 the convention on wetlands called the ramsar convention provides the framework for the conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources in sri lanka there are six wetlands declared as ramsar sites anawilundawa bundala kumana maduganga vankalai and wilpattu international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships marpol 1973 international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships marpol is the main international convention covering prevention of pollution of the marine environment by ships from operational or accidental causes the objective of this convention is to preserve the marine environment in an attempt to completely eliminate pollution by oil and other harmful substances and to minimize accidental spillage of such substances montreal protocol 1989 montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer is an international treaty designed to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production of numerous substances that are responsible for ozone depletion kyoto protocol1977 the kyoto protocol is an international agreement linked to the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc which commits its parties by setting internationally binding green house gases ghgs emission reduction targets in 2012 doha qatar the doha amendment to the kyoto protocol was adopted during this commitment period 20132020 parties are committed to reduce ghg emissions by at least 18 percent basel convention 1989 the basel convention on the control of trans boundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal intends to protect human health and the environment against the adverse effects of hazardous wastes its scope of application covers a wide range of wastes defined as hazardous wastes based on their origin andor composition and their characteristics as well as two types of wastes defined as other wastes such as waste containing heavy metals such as lead pb and mercury hg and wastes from hospitals which contains contaminants environmental legislation and policies in sri lanka the constitution of the democratic socialist republic of sri lanka has provision for the protection preservation and improvement of the environment the government of sri lanka has formulated many legislation and policies

microbiology is the study of organisms that are too small and are not visible clearly to the naked eye or unaided eye when they exist individually these organisms are referred to as microorganisms microorganisms include bacteria archaea cyanobacteria blue green bacteria bgb fungi and protists mollicutes such as mycoplasmas and phytoplasmas viruses viroids and prions are also studied under microbiology microscopic nature of microorganisms in general microorganisms are less than 01 mm in size and cannot be observed with unaided eye therefore they must be observed with a microscope microorganisms and their structural components are measured in micrometers and nanometers 1 micrometer um 10 m 1 nanometer nm 10 m some microorganisms are more readily visible than other because of their larger size ubiquitous nature of microorganisms microorganisms are ubiquitous on earth they are found in water soil air and interior and exterior surfaces of other organisms marine and freshwater microorganisms form the basis of food chain in oceans and freshwaters some of them do photosynthesis and are primary producers in aquatic environments soil microorganisms help recycling of chemical elements between soil water air and living organisms microorganisms suspended in air as bioaerosols have the opportunity to travel long distances with the wind current and precipitate pathogenic bioaerosols cause opportunities for disease spreading only a minority of microorganisms that associate with other organisms such as plants animals and human are pathogenic majority of them are advantageous or harmless however all viruses are harmful to the organisms they attached to some microorganisms are capable of inhabiting extreme environmental conditions that are unfavorable or even lethal for other organisms such microorganisms are known as extremophiles extremophiles have been found inside the earths crust deep sea at high pressures extreme acidic or extreme basic conditions hydrothermal vents frozen sea water and anaerobic conditions extremophiles are classified according to the conditions in which they grow types of extremophiles extremophiles are microorganisms that thrive in extreme environmental conditions there are various types of extremophiles each adapted to specific extreme conditions thermophiles thrive in environments with high temperatures such as hot springs and hydrothermal vents on the other hand psychrophiles are adapted to live in extremely low temperatures often found in polar regions or deepsea environments acidophiles can survive in highly acidic conditions while alkaliphiles are able to live in environments with a basic or alkaline ph halophiles require high concentrations of sodium chloride salt for their growth often inhabiting salt lakes or saline environments lastly barophiles are microorganisms that thrive under highpressure conditions typically found in deepsea environments many of these microorganisms can survive in environments that present more than one extreme condition such as hot springs that are also acidic or deepsea habitats that combine cold temperatures and high pressure some of these extreme environments consist of more than one extreme condition for example many hot springs are acidic or alkaline in nature at the same time deep seas are cold and remain in high pressure microorganisms live in such environments are adapted to live with more than one extreme condition high growth rate of microorganisms rates of growth and reproduction of microorganisms are high microorganisms possess a high surface areavolume ratio due to their smaller size this means that they have large surface area available for exchange of materials from external environment as a result flowing rate of materials in to the inside of cells and the exit of waste materials to the outside of the cells increases and results in high metabolic rate therefore average generation time or the time required to double the population of microorganisms is relatively less morphological nutritional and physiological diversity of microorganisms microorganisms possess diverse morphological forms bacteria possess diversity in their shapes basically three distinct shapes rod shape bacillus spherical shape coccus and spiral shape spirillum the coccus bacteria may arranged in different forms coccus monococcus diplococcus streptococcus staphylococcus tetrads and sarcinae bacillus bacteria may arranged in to either diplobacillus or streptobacillus spiral bacteria may arranged in to either vibrio or spirillum or spirochete cyanobacteria exhibit a great variety of shapes and arrangements unicellular to long multi cellular filaments multi cellular cyanobacteria may appear as either filamentous or nonfilamentous filamentous appear as chains and the nonfilamentous appear as clusters or colonies forming spherical cubical square or irregular shape two morphological varieties are found in viruses based on their symmetry of protein coats icosahedral and helical in fungi some of them are unicellular and others multicellular consists of a mass of fine tubular branching threads known as hyphae collectively form mycelium hyphae may be septate or aseptate prions are smaller proteinaceous particles unicellular protists possess wide range of morphological diversity mollecutes are pleomorphic variable shapes microorganisms show a diversity of nutritional types based on the sources of carbon and energy nutritional types of microbes are classified there are forum a nondurational types seen among microorganisms chemoautotrophs chemoheterotrophs photoautotrophs and photoheterotrophsbasedontheutilization of oxygen micro organ is ms can be classified in to four physiological groups obligate aerobes obligate anaerobes facultative anaerobes and microaerophiles some microbes capable of fixing atmospheric molecular nitrogen show physiological diversity freeliving nitrogen fixing microbes and symbiotic nitrogen fixing microbes,microbiology is the study of microorganisms which are tiny organisms not visible to the naked eye including bacteria archaea fungi and viruses these organisms generally smaller than 01 mm require a microscope for observation microorganisms are ubiquitous found in various environments like soil water and air playing essential roles in food chains and nutrient cycling while most are harmless or beneficial some can cause diseases extremophiles are a specific group of microorganisms adapted to extreme conditions such as high temperatures thermophiles low temperatures psychrophiles high acidity acidophiles and high salinity halophiles they exhibit high growth rates due to their small size which allows for efficient material exchange microorganisms display vast diversity in shape nutritional types and physiology morphological diversity includes shapes like cocci bacilli and spirilla nutritional types chemoautotrophs photoautotrophs and heterotrophs based on energy and carbon sources physiological groups obligate aerobes anaerobes and facultative anaerobes based on oxygen utilization
1 bacteria bacteria singular bactertum are singlecelled unicellular prokaryotic organisms they show different morphological forms and arrangements the most obvious structural feature of bacteria is the shape of individual cells there are three basic shapes 1 spherical coccus plural cocci 2 rod shape bacillus pluralbacilli 3 spiral shape plural spirilli during cell division cells can remain attached to each other and form different forms of cell arrangements different forms of cell arrangement of coccus bacteria coccus bacteria exhibit different forms of cell arrangements depending on their division patterns when coccus bacteria divide in one plane and the cells detach after division they remain as single separate cells in diplococcus arrangements the cells divide in one plane but remain attached in pairs after division streptococcus bacteria also divide in one plane but the cells stay connected in a chainlike formation in the case of tetrads the cells divide in two planes producing four cells that remain attached together in a square pattern sarcinae bacteria divide in three planes resulting in groups of eight cells that stay attached finally staphylococcus bacteria divide in multiple planes forming grapelike clusters of cells these various arrangements reflect the diverse ways in which coccus bacteria can organize after cell division different forms of cell arrangement of bacillus bacteria bacillus bacteria exhibit specific forms of cell arrangement due to their division across the short axis in the single bacillus arrangement the bacteria appear as individual rodshaped cells in diplobacillus the cells remain attached in pairs after division the streptobacillus arrangement occurs when bacilli form chains where multiple rodshaped cells remain connected after dividing these cell arrangements reflect the simple but distinct ways bacillus bacteria organize following cell division different forms of cell arrangement of spiral bacteria vibrio bacteria have a characteristic curved rod shape giving them a commalike appearance spirillum bacteria possess a helical shape similar to a corkscrew but with a rigid body in contrast spirochete bacteria also have a helical shape but their body is flexible allowing for more twisting and movement these distinctive shapes contribute to their unique modes of locomotion and behavior in various environments bacteria show a diversity of nutritional types four major nutritional types can be identified among bacteria they are classified based on the source of energy and carbon microorganisms can be classified into different nutritional types based on their sources of energy and carbon photoautotrophs derive energy from light and use carbon dioxide inorganic carbon as their carbon source with examples including purple sulfur and green sulfur bacteria photoheterotrophs also utilize light as their energy source but rely on organic carbon for growth such as purple non sulfur bacteria chemoautotrophs obtain energy from inorganic chemicals and use carbon dioxide as their carbon source with examples like nitrobacter nitrosomonas and thiobacillus thiooxidans finally chemoheterotrophs derive both energy and carbon from organic chemicals a category that includes most bacteria some bacteria are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen they show diversity in nitrogen fixation freeliving nitrogen fixing bacteria azotobacter sp symbiotic nitrogen fixing bacteria rhizobium sp with legume root mostly bacteria undergo asexual reproduction by binary fission and in some occasion fragmentation or budding in rare occasions bacteria of two strains share a portion of genetic material through the process of conjugation,bacteria are unicellular prokaryotic organisms with diverse shapes and arrangements they primarily exhibit three basic shapes coccus spherical bacillus rodshaped spirillum spiralshaped bacteria can form various arrangements based on their division patterns coccus arrangements include single cells pairs diplococcus chains streptococcus squares tetrads groups of eight sarcinae and clusters staphylococcus bacillus arrangements are categorized into single bacilli pairs diplobacillus and chains streptobacillus spiral bacteria include vibrio curved spirillum rigid helix and spirochete flexible helix bacteria also display nutritional diversity based on energy and carbon sources photoautotrophs light energy co carbon photoheterotrophs light energy organic carbon chemoautotrophs inorganic chemicals co carbon chemoheterotrophs organic chemicals for energy and carbon some bacteria can fix atmospheric nitrogen categorized into freeliving eg azotobacter and symbiotic eg rhizobium with legumes most reproduce asexually through binary fission with occasional genetic exchange via conjugation
cyanobacteria are named for their characteristic bluegreen cyan pigmentation cyanobacteria also exhibit a great variety of shapes and cell arrangements unicellular to colonial forms unicellular form cells separate after cell division however in nature majority of unicellular forms stay together by copious secretion of mucilage by daughter cells colonial form cells remain attached by walls or held in a common gelatinous matrix forming a colony of cells colonies may either be nonfilamentous or filamentous nonfilamentous colonial form depending on the plane of division and direction there are different arrangements such as spherical cubical square or irregular shape filamentous colonial form is the result of cell division in a single plane and a single direction forming a chain or thread like structure cyanobacteria are photoautotrophs that carryout oxygenic photosynthesis similar to plants and algae many of cyanobacteria are capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen for examples nostoc sp is a free living nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria anabaena azolla symbiotically fix nitrogen with its partner 4zolla sp water fern in most cases nitrogen fixation takes place in special cells called heterocyst nitrogen fixation is catalyzed by the enzyme called nitrogenase in the heterocyst nitrogenase is sensitive to oxygen heterocyst carry thick cell wall to protect nitrogenase from oxygen that could diffuse from neighboring photosynthetic cells and from air or water cyanobacteria carry another specialized cell type called akinete they are thick walled resting spores with stored food akinete is resistant to drought and high temperature therefore akinete is able to survive during unfavorable environmental conditions although vegetative cells dries out cyanobacteria reproduce only by asexual methods single unicellular and colonial non filamentous types undergo simple cell division while colonial filamentous and colonial unicellular forms reproduce by fragmentation fungi singular fungus are eukaryotes they may be unicellular yeast or multicellular molds some multicellular fungi form mushrooms molds form visible masses called mycelia which are composed of long filament like structures called hyphae many molds contain crosswalls called septa singular septum septa divide hyphae into distinct single nucleate celllike units some molds do not contain septa in their hyphae resulting in long continuous cells with many nuclei these are called coenocytic hyphae the cottony growths sometimes found on bread and fruit are mycelia of molds fungi are chemoheterotrophs and acquire food by absorption they possess saprophytic mode of nutrition they play important role in food chain by decomposing dead plant materials by secreting enzymes and thereby recycle vital elements parasitic plant and animal pathogens and mutualistic lichens and mycorrhizae modes of nutrition also found among fungi unicellular fungi reproduce asexually by fission or budding on the other hand filamentous fungi molds reproduce asexually andor sexually by producing spores unicellular protists unicellular protists are pleomorphic vary in their shapes and possess locomotive structures such as pseudopods cilia or flagella they exist either individually or form colonies some join together and form filaments photoautotrophic heterotrophic and mixotrophic modes of nutrition are found among protists there are aerobic anaerobic and facultative anaerobic respiratory modes found among protists some algae contribute to the symbiotic interactions in lichens they reproduce sexually by gametes and asexually by fission mollicutes mollicutes are prokaryotes included in the domain bacteria mycoplasma and phytoplasma are considered unique due to absence of cell walls mycoplasma and phytoplasma mycoplasma are pleomorphic vary in shape from spherical to filamentous they are the smallest prokaryotic group of organisms invisible under light microscope mycoplasma do not contain flagella almost all mycoplasma are parasites of humans and animals mycoplasma require high amount of organic growth factors they reproduce by budding and binary fission and do not produce spores mycoplasma are aerobic or facultative anaerobic phytoplasma resembles to mycoplasma in many ways they are similar in size to mycoplasma both can only be seen under electron microscope shape varies from spherical to filamentous phytoplasma only infect plants and are generally present in the phloem sap they cannot grow in artificial media they are transmitted mostly by leafhoppers therefore they reproduce in both leafhoppers as well as plant body they reproduce by budding and binary fission they possess aerobic or facultative anaerobic mode of respiration,cyanobacteria are bluegreen photosynthetic prokaryotes with diverse forms ranging from unicellular to colonial structures they can exist as unicellular organisms that often remain attached due to mucilage secretion or as colonial forms that may be nonfilamentous or filamentous notable for their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen cyanobacteria have specialized cells called heterocysts that house nitrogenase the enzyme responsible for nitrogen fixation which is sensitive to oxygen another specialized cell type akinete allows them to survive harsh conditions fungi are eukaryotic organisms either unicellular yeasts or multicellular molds characterized by structures called hyphae that form mycelia they absorb nutrients through saprophytic parasitic or mutualistic modes and reproduce asexually or sexually via spores unicellular protists exhibit a wide range of shapes and nutritional modes including photoautotrophic heterotrophic and mixotrophic they can reproduce both sexually and asexually mollicutes including mycoplasmas and phytoplasmas are unique prokaryotes lacking cell walls mycoplasmas are pleomorphic and mostly parasitic while phytoplasmas infect plants and are transmitted by leafhoppers
a characteristic features viruses are neither prokaryotes nor eukaryotes and do not show any cellular organization they do not possess any metabolic activity or reproduction when they are out of living host cells thus they are not considered as living organisms however once they get in to the host cells they multiply and cause infection through various metabolic pathways shows characteristics of living organisms since viruses can only multiply within a living host cell they are obligate parasites viruses are very small can only be seen through an electron microscope viruses possess simple structures usually are composed of a central core of a nucleic acid and surrounded by a protein coat called the capsid which is made up of a fixed number of protein subunits called capsomeres viruses may have either dna or rna as their genetic material they do not have protein synthesis machinery such as additional rnas or enzymes for protein synthesis therefore they depend on host cells protein synthesis machinery rna viruses consist of reverse transcriptase enzymes for reverse transcribing rna in to dna b morphology and types of viruses on the basis of capsid architecture two basic morphological symmetries can be identified figure 98 1 helical 2 icosahedral based on the above symmetries viruses show four types of morphological forms helical polyhedron complex and enveloped i helical viruses long rigid or flexible rods eg rabies virus tobacco mossaic virus il polyhedral viruses icosahedral symmetry present eg adeno virus ii complex virusesexhibits more than one form of symmetry with additional structures eg bacteriophage iv enveloped viruses eg roughly spherical capsid covered by envelopes eg herpes simplex virus they can show either helical or icosahedral symmetry multiplication of viruses a single virus can give rise to thousands of similar viruses in a single host cell therefore viruses cause serious damages to their host leading to severe diseases in plants animals and bacteria bacteriophages are typical group of viruses that are capable of infecting bacteria they multiply by two distinct mechanisms lytic cycle or lysogenic cycle lytic cycle involves with the lysis of the host cell whereas the lysogenic cycle allows viral dna incorporating into host dna and multiply without causing lysis of the host cell lytic cycle of a bacteriophage there are five distinct steps in the lytic cycle attachment penetration biosynthesis maturation and release attachment the first step is the attachment of virus to a matching receptor site on the bacterial cell penetration after attachment bacteriophage injects its dna into the bacterial cell this is facilitated by an enzyme which breaks down bacterial cell wall biosynthesis the next step is the biosynthesis of viral dna and proteins in the host cytoplasm using host resources this stage induces degradation of host cell dna maturation and assembly once bacteriophage dna and proteins are synthesized dna and capsid are assembled to form complete virus particles this is called maturation release finally bacteriophage induce bacterial cell to break open lyse newly produced bacteriophages are released from the host cell these released bacteriophages can start another lytic cycle in cells in the vicinity viroids viroids consist only of short piece of naked rna with no protective layer such as a protein coat viroids can only multiply within a living host cell using host cell resources however viroids do not contain any gene and only carry signals for their multiplication viroids infect plants but no other life forms till to date prions prions are proteinaceous infectious particles their size is smaller than virus although prions lack nucleic acid they can replicate with the help of a hosts gene that encodes the prion protein they are found as disease causing agents in some birds and mammals all these diseases are neurological diseases transmissible spongiform encephalopathies tses because large vacuoles develop in the brain giving spongelike appearance mad cow disease was one of the serious disease emerged in cattle in 1987 creutzfeldtjakob disease cjd is one of the human diseases caused by prions human to human disease transmission has been associated with transfusion of infected blood and tissue and organ transplantation some tse infections may be transmitted from cow to human,viruses are unique infectious agents that are neither prokaryotic nor eukaryotic and lack cellular organization they cannot reproduce or metabolize outside a living host making them obligate parasites composed of nucleic acid dna or rna surrounded by a protein coat capsid they rely on host cellular machinery for replication based on capsid architecture viruses can be classified into four morphological types helical long rodlike structures eg rabies virus polyhedral icosahedral symmetry eg adenovirus complex multiple forms of symmetry eg bacteriophage enveloped spherical with an outer lipid envelope eg herpes simplex virus viruses multiply through either the lytic cycle which results in cell lysis or the lysogenic cycle where viral dna integrates into the host genome viroids are simple rna molecules that infect plants while prions are infectious proteins that cause neurological diseases such as mad cow disease and creutzfeldtjakob disease by inducing misfolding of normal proteins in the host
for the study of morphology and biochemical properties of microorganisms it is essential to culture them on artificial media there are some basic laboratory techniques such as preparation of artificial culture media and sterilization techniques to be followed in culturing of the microorganism of interest without any contamination this section describes such basic laboratory techniques methods of sterilization sterilization is the process of removal or destruction of all forms of microbial life including endospores there are two types of sterilization physical and chemical i physical methods of sterilization sterilization by moist heat dry heat filtering using membrane filters exposure to uv radiation are some of the physical methods used in sterilization moist heat sterilization here moist heat is used to destroy the microorganisms present in the desired materials such as culture media temperature stable reagents fluids and various laboratory utensils this is done by denaturing of proteins by high temperature and pressure eg autoclaving in an autoclave steam with 121 c temperature at the pressure of atm 15 psi is used for sterilization extending the above condition for 15 minutes is sufficient to kill all microorganisms except prions and their endospores autoclaving is used to sterilize culture media solutions healthcare instruments and various other items that can withstand high temperatures and pressure glassware can also be sterilized with an autoclave if care is taken to ensure that the steam contacts all surfaces pressure cooker also can be used for moist heat sterilization dry heat sterilization here dry heat is used to destroy the microorganisms present in the desired materials such as glassware petri dishes pipettes inoculation loops inoculation needles scalpels etc 1 direct flaming it is a simple method of dry heat sterilization this is used in laboratories to sterilize inoculating loops inoculating needles and scalpel blades by heating them on the flames of bunsen burners hot spirit lamp until they reach red hot 2 incineration it is mostly done in an incineration oven at high temperatures incineration is used to sterilize hospital waste microorganisms are burned to ash during direct flaming and incineration 3 hotair sterilization microorganism are killed by oxidation items to be sterilized are heated to about 170 c and maintain for 2 hours in a dry air oven this type of sterilization is often used to sterilize glassware such as petri plates flasks beakers bottles and pipettes pasteurization louis pasteur found spoilage of beer and wine can be prevented by applying mild heat that kills organisms causing spoilage without seriously damaging the taste texture and nutritional content of the product later the same principle was applied to milk products now known as pasteurized milk the objectives of milk pasteurization are to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms and reduce microbial number which prolongs milk quality under refrigeration high temperature shorttime htst pasteurization which uses temperature of at least 72 c for 15 seconds and low temperature long time ltlt 63 c for 30 minutes are the two main methods of pasteurization milk can also be sterilized by ultrahightemperature uht pasteurization here milk is heated to about 140 c in less than 5 seconds by flashing steam this milk can be stored for several months without refrigeration boiling boiling the materials such as surgical instruments to 100 c most of the pathogenic microorganisms are killed at boiling temperature filtration eg membrane filters filtration is used to sterilize heat sensitive liquids such as solutions containing enzymes vitamins antibiotics vaccines and some culture media material to be sterilized is passed through a filter by using vacuum filter retains microorganism and the liquid is passed through the filter membrane filters are widely used to sterilize heat sensitive solutions pores of membrane filters are from 001 um to 045 pm size retain almost all the microorganisms including viruses and some large protein molecules uv radiation uv radiation kills microorganisms that falls in to direct exposure either through destruction or damaging dna however a major disadvantage of uv is that radiation does not penetrate through solid surfaces and coverings such as paper glass and textile therefore anything to be sterilized should have direct contact with radiation uv radiation is commonly used to sterilize air in hospital rooms such as operating theaters and nurseries ii chemical methods of sterilization few chemicals such as ethylene oxide and chlorine dioxide both are gases are currently used as chemical sterilizing agents majority of chemical agents reduce microbial populations to a safe levels or remove vegetative forms of pathogens ethylene oxide kills microorganisms and endospores it is also highly penetrating therefore ethylene oxide is used to sterilize mattresses in hospitals chlorine dioxide has been used to fumigate enclosed building areas contaminated with endospores of bacillus anthracis it is most commonly used in water treatment prior to chlorination preparation of culture media microorganisms cannot be studied in their natural habitat such as in soil water or air therefore we need to bring them to the laboratory and provide similar conditions for their growth and reproduction a nutrient material prepared for providing nutrition and anchorage essential to the growth of microorganisms at laboratory condition is called a culture medium not all microorganism can be grown on a laboratory culture media they are called nonculturable microorganisms some microorganisms grow well on any culture medium whereas other microorganisms require special medium suppose we want to grow a culture of microorganisms present in a certain soil sample the culture medium should contain necessary nutrients sufficient moisture and suitable ph this medium must initially be sterile which means it should not contain any living microorganisms therefore when preparing a culture medium all glassware and liquid nutrient solutions should be sterilized nutrient agar na and potato dextrose agar pda are two general media commonly used to grow bacteria and fungi respectively nutrient agar is made up of peptone meat extract sodium chloride agar and distilled water whereas pda is made up of potato glucose agar and distilled water here agar is used as a solidifying agent agar solidifies at temperatures below 40 c which means a culture medium containing agar is a solid medium for growing microorganisms solid culture medium is usually contained in petri dishes or test tubes because most microorganisms appear almost colorless when viewed through a standard light microscope we have to prepare them for observations one of the ways this can be done is by staining means coloring the microorganisms with a dye however before the microorganisms stain they must be fixed attached to the microscopic slide a simple stain is an aqueous or alcohol solution of a single basic dye the primary purpose of a simple stain is to highlight the entire microorganisms so that cellular shapes cell arrangements and basic structures are visible some of the simple stains commonly used in the laboratory are methylene blue crystal violet and safranin,culturing microorganisms in artificial media is essential for studying their morphology and biochemical properties sterilization techniques ensure the removal of all microbial life before culturing methods of sterilization physical methods moist heat sterilization utilizes autoclaving at 121 c under 15 psi for 15 minutes to kill microorganisms dry heat sterilization involves direct flaming incineration and hotair sterilization at 170 c for 2 hours to eliminate microbes from glassware and instruments pasteurization applies mild heat to kill spoilage organisms in liquids like milk using methods like htst 72 c for 15 seconds and uht 140 c for 5 seconds filtration sterilizes heatsensitive solutions using membrane filters with pores as small as 001 m to retain microorganisms uv radiation destroys microorganisms by damaging their dna but requires direct exposure chemical methods ethylene oxide a gas that penetrates materials sterilizing items like hospital mattresses chlorine dioxide used for fumigation and water treatment preparation of culture media culture media provide nutrients for microorganisms common types include nutrient agar for bacteria and potato dextrose agar for fungi these media must be sterile and can be solidified using agar staining staining highlights microorganisms for visibility under a microscope simple stains like methylene blue or crystal violet are used to enhance contrast
generally humans are free of microorganisms at birth however during birth the newborn first get in contact with microorganisms present on the vagina of mother usually these are lactobacilli lactobacilli colonize the intestine of the newborn after birth many other microbial populations begin to establish inside or on the surface of the body these are called normal microbiota of human body however internal tissues of healthy human body are free of microorganisms a part of these microorganisms colonize on the skin and majority enter the body and colonize on the inner surfaces such as mucous membranes of nose throat upper respiratory tract intestinal tract and genitourinary tract anormal healthy body contains a large number of microorganisms it has been estimated that the human body consists of 1 x 10 microbial cells for 1 x 10 total body cells which means a 10 times more microbial cells than human cells majority of these organisms are generally harmless or even beneficial for example minimal colonization of escherichia coli at large intestine prevent colonization of pathogenic bacteria such as salmonella typhi coli in large intestine synthesizes vitamin k and some of the b vitamins that are absorbed into the bloodstream and used by body cells recent interest in the importance of bacteria to human health has led to the study of probiotics probiotics are live microbial cultures eg yoghurt exert a beneficial effect several studies have shown that ingestion of certain lactic acid bacteria can alleviate diarrhea and prevent colonization by salmonella enterica during antibiotic therapy although majority of human microbiota are harmless some of them may change their interactions with human body under certain conditions and cause infections those microorganisms are called opportunistic pathogens for example coli is generally harmless as long as it remains in the large intestine however they may cause diseases if enter other body parts urinary bladder urinary tract infection lungs pulmonary infection terms related to infectious diseases pathogen an organisms or entity nonliving entities such as virus and prions that is capable of causing disease host organism within which infected pathogens live on or in and multiply pathogenicity the ability of a pathogen to cause disease in the host by overcoming the defense of a host parasite an organism or entity living on or in another living organism host and obtain nutrients and other resources from the host characteristics of pathogenic microorganisms having optimal growth conditions eg temperature that corresponds to the body conditions of the host having structures to adhere to the host cells and protect against hosts defense mechanisms eg capsule pili produce toxins endotoxins or exotoxins having enzymes for invasiveness such as phospholipase lesithinase and hyaluronidase having enzymes such as dnase to alter the hosts metabolic processes virulence and virulent factors microbes express their pathogenicity by means of their virulence virulence is the degree of pathogenicity of the pathogen some pathogens are highly virulent chicken pox virus whereas others are less virulent non virulent few genes of pathogenic microorganisms express factors which provide them the ability to infect their host and cause disease such factors are called virulent factors the relationship between a host and a pathogen is dynamic each modifies the activities and functions of the other as a result outcome of such a relationship depends on the virulence of the pathogen and the effectiveness of the host defense mechanisms virulence factors enhance the pathogenicity and allows pathogen to invade and colonize host tissues and disrupt normal body function pathogens use two major mechanisms for pathogenicity 1 invasiveness it is the ability of pathogens to invade tissues by overcoming hosts defense mechanisms and multiply for colonizing several extracellular enzymes produced by pathogens contribute to invasiveness eg phospholipase destroy animal cell membranes lecithinase hydrolyzes the lecithin component of the lipid in the cell membrane hyaluronidase destroys the body tissue by breaking down the hyaluronic acid which is cementing substance between cells pathogenic microorganisms do enter passively through various portals or natural openings such as wounds on skin respiratory gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts 2 toxigenecity ability of microorganisms to produce biochemical substances known as toxins that disrupt the normal functions of cells these are proteins or lipopolysaccharides that produce specific harmful effects on the host thus are called biological poisons they may be endotoxins endotoxins are lipopolysaccharides these are thermosstable toxins which are part of the microbial cell toxins are released when the bacteria die and the cell wall breaks apart all endotoxins cause the same signs of symptoms regardless of the species of pathogen these symptoms include chills fever weakness generalized aches and sometimes shock and death endotoxins are produced only by gramnegative bacteria eg lipopolysaccharides of the cell walls of salmonella typhi exotoxins exotoxins are produced inside bacterial cells as part of their growth and metabolism and are secreted or released to the surrounding environment after cell lysis exotoxins are proteins majority of them are enzymes due to their catalytic nature even a small amount of toxin is quite harmful these are thermolabile protein toxins being inactivated by boiling exotoxins are most commonly produced by grampositive bacteria and a few gram negative bacteria exotoxins are classified into three types neurotoxins interfere with normal transmission of nerve impulses eg toxins produced by clostridium tetant enterotoxins stimulates cells of the gastrointestinal tract in an abnormal way eg toxins produced by vibrio cholera cytotoxins kills host cells by enzymatic attack eg toxins produced by corynebacterium diptheria,humans are born free of microorganisms but quickly acquire them during birth particularly lactobacilli which colonize the intestine the collective microbial population in the human body is referred to as the normal microbiota which primarily resides on the skin and mucous membranes but is absent in internal tissues the human body contains about ten times more microbial cells than human cells most of these microorganisms are harmless or beneficial such as escherichia coli which helps prevent pathogenic infections and synthesizes vitamins however some microorganisms can act as opportunistic pathogens causing infections under certain conditions key terms related to infectious diseases include pathogen an organism capable of causing disease host the organism that harbors pathogens pathogenicity the ability of a pathogen to cause disease parasite an organism living on or in a host and obtaining nutrients from it pathogenic microorganisms possess virulence factors which enhance their ability to infect and disrupt host functions pathogenicity is expressed through invasiveness the ability to invade tissues and overcome host defenses toxigenicity the production of toxins that disrupt normal cell functions including endotoxins lipopolysaccharides from gramnegative bacteria causing systemic symptoms exotoxins secreted proteins that can cause specific harmful effects classified into neurotoxins enterotoxins and cytotoxins
various diseases in humans are caused by microorganisms encompassing a range of organ systems chickenpox is caused by the herpesvirus varicellazoster while skin diseases such as rubella and measles are attributed to the rubella virus and measles virus respectively eye infections like conjunctivitis can be caused by haemophilus influenzae or adenoviruses in the nervous system bacterial meningitis can be triggered by streptococcus pneumoniae haemophilus influenzae and neisseria meningitidis other nervous system diseases include tetanus caused by clostridium tetani and rabies caused by the rabies virus the cardiovascular system can be affected by rheumatic fever which is caused by streptococcus pyogenes tuberculosis is linked to mycobacterium tuberculosis while the digestive system is susceptible to food poisoning from organisms such as staphylococcus aureus vibrio cholerae and salmonella typhi as well as cholera and typhoid infections in the respiratory system influenza is caused by the influenza virus and pneumonia can be due to streptococcus pneumoniae hepatitis is linked to the hepatitis a virus the urinary system is affected by leptospirosis caused by leptospira interrogans while the reproductive system can see infections like gonorrhea caused by neisseria gonorrhoeae and genital herpes caused by the herpes simplex virus finally the immune system is compromised in cases of aids caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv these diseases illustrate the diverse impact microorganisms have on human health across various body systems avoidance and prevention of microbial diseases good hygienic practices in day to day life is the best method to avoid infectious diseases antiseptics disinfectants and immunization play import role in prevention of infection methods of controlling microbial diseases of human use of antiseptics and disinfectants antiseptics and disinfectants are chemical substances that are used to kill or reduce microbial population in order to prevent infection however such chemicals are not effective against some microorganisms for example polio virus tuberculosis bacterium spores of bacteria and fungi are not destroyed by most antiseptics and disinfectants the major difference between antiseptics and disinfectants is that antiseptics can be safely and directly applied to the human body whereas disinfectants cannot therefore antiseptics are used in disinfection of living surfaces such as skin disinfectants are used in disinfection of nonliving surfaces such as operation theatres bathing areas sinks kitchen tops cutlery drains etc antiseptics and disinfectants are generally formulated as liquids their effectiveness varies with concentration duration of exposure temperature and presence of organic matter some examples of antiseptics and disinfectants are given below antiseptics ethanol isopropanol chloroxylenol disinfectants phenol hypochlorites calctum hypochlorite and sodium hypochlorite use of antibiotics in controlling microbial diseases when the bodys defense fails to protect body from the infection or overcome the disease it has to be treated by chemotherapy with antimicrobial drugs antimicrobial drugs kill or interfere with the growth of microorganism without damaging the host antibiotics are effective antimicrobial drugs against bacteria some antibiotics affect against a broad range of bacteria and they are termed as broadspectrum antibiotics while others affect only against a specific group of bacteria and are called narrowspectrum antibiotics antibiotics show various modes of action some examples are given below inhibition of cell wall synthesis penicillin inhibition of protein synthesis erythromycin tetracycline disrupting plasma membrane daptomycin inhibition of dnarna synthesis rifampin immunization vaccines a vaccine is a suspension of weakened pathogens or fractions of organisms that is used to induce immunity vaccines are frequently used to control diseases caused by viruses because there is no other control methods once infected there are several types of vaccines 1 live attenuated vaccines vaccine contains live pathogens which were deliberately weakened for its pathogenicity these vaccines mimic an actual infection since the pathogen is active inside the host such vaccines provide lifelong immunity more often a booster secondary immunization is not required examples for live attenuated vaccines are vaccines for measles mumps and rubella mmr chickenpox 2 inactivated vaccines pathogenic microorganism is inactivated or killed in the vaccine compared to live attenuated vaccines inactivated killed vaccines often require repeated booster doses examples for inactivated vaccines are vaccines for virus diseases such as rabies influenza polio bacterial diseases such as cholera 3 subunit vaccines subunit vaccines contain only the antigenic fragments of a pathogen that can induce immunity in the recipient toxoid vaccines are the best examples for subunit vaccines those have been used for a long time toxoids contain inactivated toxins derived from a pathogen examples for toxoid vaccines are vaccines for tetanus diphtheria etc presently subunit vaccines are produced using genetic engineering eg hepatitisb vaccines subunit vaccines usually require repeated booster dose to obtain full immunity,microorganisms cause various diseases in humans across multiple organ systems notable diseases include chickenpox caused by the herpesvirus varicellazoster skin diseases like rubella and measles due to the rubella and measles viruses eye infections such as conjunctivitis caused by haemophilus influenzae or adenoviruses and bacterial meningitis triggered by streptococcus pneumoniae haemophilus influenzae and neisseria meningitidis effective prevention methods against microbial diseases include good hygiene practices essential for avoiding infections antiseptics and disinfectants chemicals used to kill or reduce microbial populations antiseptics are safe for human skin while disinfectants are for nonliving surfaces examples include ethanol antiseptic and phenol disinfectant antibiotics used to treat infections when the bodys defenses fail they work by inhibiting cell wall synthesis eg penicillin or protein synthesis eg erythromycin immunization vaccines these induce immunity through weakened or inactivated pathogens types include live attenuated vaccines eg mmr chickenpox inactivated vaccines eg rabies polio subunit vaccines eg tetanus hepatitis b these methods are crucial for controlling microbial diseases and maintaining public health
microorganisms have been exploited for various purposes long before their discovery babylonian and sumerian civilizations used yeast to make alcohol in as early as 6000 bc after the discovery of microorganisms in the latter part of the nineteenth century pure cultures of microorganisms are being used in the food production this increased the understanding of microorganisms their processes and products at present various industries based on selected microorganisms and their qualities are in operation 1 advantages of using microbial processes over chemical processes simple nutritional requirements are sufficient for their growth they are able to convert metabolize a wide range of raw materials they are able to convert cheap raw materials into industrially important products due to higher growth rate they can convert the raw materials into products within a short period of time their growth conditions can be controlled to obtain desired end products reactions can be carried out at low temperatures energy and pressures compared to the conventional industrial methods they give higher yield with higher specificity when compared to the conventional industrial methods microbes are amendable to genetic manipulation to obtain desired yield and quality with high efficiency basic principles of metabolic processes of microorganisms for product formations 1 microbial cells are used as the end products eg single cell proteins 2 microbial metabolic products are used as end products they may be either primary end products or secondary metabolites eg primary end products alcoholic beverages secondary metabolites antibiotics 3 microbial metabolic processes are used as end products eg bioremediation heavy metal remediation metal extraction cu fe retting production of

microorganisms in industries industrial microbiology is the large scale production of economically important products using microorganisms and their metabolic processes recent technological and biotechnological advances expanded the scope of industrial microbiology bacteria fungi algae and viruses are used in industry in industrial microbiology microorganisms can be considered as miniature chemical factories where various energy releasing catabolic and energy acquiring anabolic chemical reactions take place within this factory raw materials substrates are converted into end products one or more byproducts and wastes end products can be separated from byproducts and wastes by purification to obtain a purified industrial products commercial products made by microorganisms and their processes 1 single cell proteins microbial cells are grown in large scale as food supplement and rich in proteins are called single cell proteins eg yeast spirulina sp and chlorella sp 2 alcohol and alcoholic beverages microorganisms are involved in the production of almost all alcoholic beverages such as beer wine sake toddy and ethanol yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae ferment sugars into ethanol and carbon dioxide globally more than 70 of ethanol is produced by fermentation sucrose derived from sugarcane is the most widely used fermentation substrate in addition simple sugars derived from plants and dairy waste are also used eg 1 beer by the fermentation of cereal grain malt 2 wine produced by the fermentation of grapes or other suitable fruits 3 toddy produced by the fermentation of sap of palms such as palmyra and coconut 4 arrack produced by fermentation of palm tree sap such as coconut and sugarcane 3 production of vinegar there are two steps in vinegar production 1 alcoholic fermentation sugars in malted grain sap of palms sugarcane and fruit juices is fermented by s cerevisiae ethanol is subjected to acetic acid fermentation 2 acetic acid fermentation ethanol derived from alcoholic fermentation undergoes incomplete oxidation and is converted to acetic acid this process is highly aerobic and involves acetobacter sp and gluconobacter sp acetic acid bacteria 4 dairy products dairy products are made by the fermentation of milk sugar lactose in milk is fermented by lactic acid producing bacteria into lactic acid these bacteria are killed during pasteurization therefore added externally when making dairy products eg curd and yoghurt is produced by fermentation of lactose sugar in milk by a mix population of lactobacillus bulgaricus lactococcus lactis and s thermophilus l bulgaricus add flavor and streptococcus spp add creamy texture and flavor production of cheese streptococcus sp penicillium molds lactic acid is commercially produced by using waste

fermentation substrates such as beat or cane molasses and organisms such as aspergillus niger are used eg citric acids sucrose fermented by aspergillus niger 6 metal extraction some metals from ore are extracted with the help of microorganisms this process is called leaching one of the best example is extraction of copper from lower grades of copper ore for which other extraction methods are unprofitable thiobacillus ferrooxidans recover copper from the ore that contains iron and sulfur about 70 of copper in the ore can be recovered by this microbial process uranium gold and cobalt ore are also leached in similar manner using microbial processes 7 production of vitamins microbes can provide a source of an inexpensive source of vitamins for individual food supplements eg vitamin b2 pseudomonas sp and propionibacterium sp riboflavin fermentation by fungi vitamin c acetobacter sp 8 vaccines commercial production of vaccine is done by variety of microbial antigens used in active immunization against various diseases some of them are genetically engineered vaccines eg hepatitis b vaccines commercial production of various antibody preparation used for passive immunization eg

bacillus subtilis protease 4 oryzae lipase rhizopus spp invertase saccharomyces cerevisiae cellulase a niger 10 antibiotics antibiotics is the most important secondary metabolites of microorganisms many antibiotics are still produced by microbial fermentation tetracycline s awreofaciens penicillin penicillium chrysene streptomycin streptomyces griseus 11 hormones a human insulin conventionally insulin is extracted from animal pancreas however this is expensive and often cannot meet the demand at present insulin is produced cheaply by using genetically modified coli and s cerevisiae this insulin is identical to human insulin b human growth hormone earlier animalderived hormones were used as alternatives to human growth hormone but with very less efficiency at present this hormone is successfully produced by genetically engineered coli in large scale 12 retting retting is the process of loosening fibers from woody stem or other plant material such as coir for retting plant materials are immersed in water for varying periods of time depending on the plant material heterogeneous bacterial populations participate in the process under aerobic or anaerobic conditions bacteria secrete enzymes mainly pectinases to facilitate loosening 13 biogas production anaerobic digestion of organic waste produces various gases called biogas the type of biogas produced depends on the substrate biodegraded activity of acetogenic bacteria on the organic waste produce carbon dioxide and hydrogen whereas activity of methanogenic bacteria produce methane 14 biofuel production petroleumbased fuel supply is expensive and sometimes uncertain asa result much attention has been given to renewable replacement fuels such as ethanol butanol biodiesel and biogas etc in brazil a large amount of ethanol is produced by microbial fermentation of sugarcane to be used as a source of fuel also efforts have been made to produce ethanol and butanol from cellulosic materials such as wood wastepaper and cornstalks by using genetically modified bacteria many researches are going on to produce biodiesel from microalgae 15 bakery products sugars in bread dough is fermented by s cerevisiae bakerss yeast the primary function of fermentation in bread is to generate carbon dioxide bread dough is made with grain flour such as wheat rye and rice dough traps carbon dioxide and rises due to the pressure during baking and form open crumb texture,microorganisms have been utilized for various purposes since ancient civilizations particularly in food production they are favored in industrial processes due to several advantages over chemical methods including simple nutritional needs rapid growth and the ability to convert cheap raw materials into valuable products key applications of microorganisms in industries include single cell proteins microbial cells like yeast and algae are cultivated as proteinrich food supplements alcoholic beverages yeasts particularly saccharomyces cerevisiae ferment sugars to produce alcohol with over 70 of global ethanol produced this way dairy products lactic acid bacteria ferment lactose in milk producing yogurt and cheese organic acids microbes like aspergillus niger are used to produce citric acid through fermentation metal extraction certain bacteria extract metals from ores a process known as leaching vitamins and hormones microorganisms can produce vitamins and hormones like insulin and growth hormone biogas and biofuels anaerobic digestion of organic waste produces biogas while fermentation processes generate renewable fuels such as ethanol these diverse applications demonstrate the significant role of microorganisms in biotechnology and industrial microbiology
applications of microorganisms in environment management industries and agriculture release various chemicals substances that are not readily degradable in nature for example plastic is a synthetic substance that is not biodegraded residues of pesticides such as heavy metals insecticide ddt herbicide 24d are some other examples of chemicals that are not degraded or very slowly degraded by microorganisms and retain in the soil for long periods and also contaminates groundwater 1 bioremediation bioremediation is a technology that applies of living organisms to remove degrade or detoxify pollutants bioremediation naturally occurs in the soil in most occasions microorganisms are used in bioremediation processes growth of microorganisms in polluted soils and water can be stimulated to promote biodegradation bioremoval of pollutants microorganisms with selected properties or genetically modified microorganisms with selected properties can be used to degrade remove a specific pollutant from the polluted sites bioremediation is currently used to remediate soil and water contaminated with oil spills toxic metal waste hazardous organic waste ete decompose wastewater from food processing and chemical plants 2 solid waste treatment accumulation of solid waste from house hold garbage possesses various environmental and health issues in waste treatment waste is degraded by microorganisms either aerobically or anaerobically composting degrades waste aerobically at the end waste is converted to a stable material like humus mostly garbage are placed as large compacted landfills or piles where conditions are mostly anaerobic in such situations waste is degraded anaerobically using methanogenic bacteria methane gas produced as a byproduct of the degradation process it may be used to generate electricity or as natural gas applications of microorganisms in agriculture microorganisms have various applications in agriculture for improving yield agronomic characteristics such as improved nitrogen and phosphorus absorption resistance to pest and diseases and tolerance to drought etc 1 biofertilizers nitrogen and phosphorus are the most limiting nutrients in soil for plant growth and development therefore chemical fertilizers are applied to the soil to improve bioavailability of these nutrients however intensive use of synthetic fertilizers may result environmental problems such as deprivation of soil and water quality hence much attention has been given for microorganisms that can be applied into the cropping systems to improve bioavailability of n and p these microbial inoculants are called bio fertilizers a phosphate solubilizing bacteria and mycorrhizae phosphorus is the most limiting nutrient among all major plant nutrients bioavailability of phosphorus in any type of soil is negligible very low amount of phosphorus applied to the soil remain available for plants phosphate solubilizing bacteria and mycorrhizae contributes in improving the solubility of phosphorus in the soil solution these bacteria and fungi secrete organic acids that dissolve minerals containing phosphorus and chelate cationic partners of the phosphate ions thereby release phosphorus into the soil solution at present commercial formulations of microbial biofertilizers are available in the market b nitrogen fixing microorganism biological nitrogen fixation is a process where microorganisms convert atmospheric molecular nitrogen into its soluble form these soluble forms of nitrogen can be assimilated by some plants directly or converted into desired soluble forms of nitrogen eg symbiotic nitrogen fixing o rhizobium sp form intimate relationships with leguminous plants the fixed nitrogen 1s released to the soil when plants die making nitrogen available for other plants various rhizobium inoculations are commercially available o nitrogenfixing cyanobacteria anabaena sp form symbiotic association with water fern azoilla this system has been successfully used in rice cultivation in many countries free living nitrogen fixing o free living nitrogen fixing bacteria such as azofobacter present in high concentrations at rhizosphere c plant growth promoting bacteria many microorganisms in the plant rhizosphere produce plant growthpromoting substances like auxins indole3acitic acid cytokinins these bacteria include pseudomonas putida p fluorescens auxin azotobacter sp rhizobium sp b subtilis p fluorescens cytokinins acetobacter sp azospirillum sp gibberellin names of the above microorganisms are not expected to be memorized by the students 2 biopesticides bio control agents bca extensive use of chemical pesticides leads to hazardous side effects to people these substances or their residues persist in food and the environment the residual toxicity may affect the nontarget organisms further over use of pesticides develop resistance against pesticides among the pests therefore environmentally friendly and less toxic alternative strategies are required to replace synthetic chemicals as pesticides naturally occurring microorganisms are being explored to control pests and diseases some microbial formulations are currently commercially available and widely used in many cropping systems those include entomopathogenic fungi bacteria and viruses entomopathogenic fungi these fungi infect a broad range of insects leading to insect death they have been formulated into mycoinsecticides entomopathogenic bacteria bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal and toxic for many insect larvae protein crystals produced by this bacterium are toxic to larvae when ingested this toxin is called bt toxin after ingestion toxin is dissolved and lyse tissues of the guts of larvae majority of biopesticide formulations currently in use are btbased 3 composting composting is a process used to convert plant remains into the equivalent of natural humus by microbial degradation degradation of organic matter by a mix population of microbes under warm moist and aerobic conditions initial activity of thermophilic bacteria on the plant remains increase temperature of the pile to 5560 c as a result thermophilic bacteria dominate in the degradation process for few days when temperature decreases over time thermophilic microbial population is replaced by mesophilic microbial populations the process can be enhanced by addition of moisture and supply of oxygen through turning the pile in addition to bacteria microbes such as fungus actinomycetes and protozoa also contribute to the breakdown of organic matter into compost,microorganisms play a crucial role in environmental management and agriculture by addressing pollution and improving soil health bioremediation this process involves using living organisms to detoxify and remove pollutants such as oil spills and heavy metals from contaminated soil and water microorganisms can be naturally present or genetically modified for enhanced degradation of specific pollutants solid waste treatment microorganisms help in degrading solid waste through aerobic and anaerobic processes composting an aerobic method converts waste into stable materials like humus while anaerobic degradation in landfills produces methane which can be harnessed as a renewable energy source biofertilizers these are microbial inoculants that enhance nutrient availability in soils phosphate solubilizing bacteria and mycorrhizae improve phosphorus solubility nitrogenfixing microorganisms such as rhizobium convert atmospheric nitrogen into forms accessible to plants biopesticides naturally occurring microorganisms are utilized as biological control agents to reduce pest populations without the harmful effects associated with chemical pesticides composting this aerobic process converts organic waste into compost through microbial degradation resulting in nutrientrich soil amendments through these applications microorganisms help promote sustainable agricultural practices and mitigate environmental pollution
soil provides an adequate physical and chemical environment for growth of microorganisms in terms of space and nutrients which include minerals decomposing organic materials water gases such as carbon dioxide oxygen and nitrogen within a few centimeter depth of soil there are different amounts of oxygen moisture light and nutrition increasing the diversity of soil microorganisms the top few centimeters of the soil contains the largest community of bacteria microbial number declines rapidly with increasing depth majority of soil microflora is represented by bacteria in addition there are fungi algae protozoa and actinomycetes actinomycetes despite of being a member of domain bacteria usually it is mentioned separately due to their significances these microorganisms play a major role in decomposition of complex organic substances and participate in cycling of elements in biogeochemical cycles elements are oxidized and reduced by microorganisms for their metabolic requirements 1 mineralization mineralization is the decomposition of plant and animal residue by using extracellular enzymes of bacteria and fungi these enzymes break down complex organic materials into simple inorganic materials such as co and ho this is the major process by which plant nutrients are made available and recycling mineralization helps in following ways helps to remove plant and animal debris from the earth surface allowing other organisms to live recycle minerals which are found in limited quantities on the earth 2 role of microorganisms in the carbon cycle all organisms contain a large amount of carbon in organic compounds such as cellulose starch proteins and fat photosynthesis is the important first step in carbon cycle in which the atmospheric inorganic carbon dioxide is reducedfixed to form organic compounds by photosynthetic organisms photoautotrophs such as plants cyanobacteria algae and photosynthetic bacteria fix carbon dioxide using energy from sunlight chemoheterotrophs such as animals and protozoa depend on organic compounds produced by autotrophs to utilize them as their carbon source through food chain carbon fixed from carbon dioxide by autotrophs transferred from organism at lower trophic levels to the organisms at higher trophic levels both autotrophs and chemoheterotrophs release a part of their fixed carbon as carbon dioxide to the atmosphere through respiration this carbon dioxide is again made available for autotrophs in chemoheterotrophs undigested food is released to the environment as faeces which 1s later decomposed by soil microorganisms rest of the carbon fixed in organisms remain within them until they die once the organisms are dead these organic compounds are decomposed and carbon dioxide is returned back to the atmosphere microorganisms mainly bacteria and fungi play a major role in organic matter decomposition microorganisms play another major role in carbon cycle in relation to methane gas ocean sediments contain a large amount of methane however about 80 of methane generated within ocean is consumed by microorganisms called methanotrophs before it reaches to the atmosphere despite of the above methanogenic bacteria in the oceans depths are constantly producing more methane 3 role of microorganisms in the nitrogen cycle all organisms require nitrogen to synthesize protein nucleic acid and other nitrogen containing compounds about 80 of molecular nitrogen available in the atmosphere this 1s not biologically available for organisms therefore it is essential to convert that atmospheric molecular nitrogen into bioavailable forms of nitrogen certain groups of microorganisms are able to fix gaseous molecular nitrogen into bioavailable forms of nitrogen such as ammonia nitrate and nitrite therefore nitrogen available on the earth organisms and the atmosphere must follow cyclic paths there are four key steps in the nitrogen cycle they are ammonification nitrification denitrification and nitrogen fixation ammonification more than 90 of organic nitrogen in the soil exist as proteins proteins from dead plants and animals are decomposed by extracellular proteolytic enzymes secreted by microorganisms into amino acids resulting amino acids are taken into microbial cells and are then subjected to ammonification in which amino groups of amino acids are converted into ammonia nh in moist soil ammonia is solubilized in water to form ammonium ions nh this ammonium ions are utilized by plants and soil microorganisms ammonia in dry soil rapidly disappear into the atmosphere nitrification nitrification is the process of oxidation of nitrogen in the ammonium ion to produce nitrate this process is done by nitrifying bacteria living in soil in two stages in the first stage microorganisms such as nitrosomonas oxidizes ammonium ions into nitrites plants utilize nitrate as their source of nitrogen therefore microorganisms play essential roles in providing nitrogen in bioavailable forms for plants and animals denitrification in the absence of atmospheric oxygen some microorganism use nitrate and reduces it into n this process is called denitrification denitrification causes loss of nitrogen into the atmosphere therefore it reduces available nitrogen in the soil denitrification frequently occurs in waterlogged soils where limited oxygen is present pseudomonas sp converts nitrate ions into molecular nitrogen through following steps nitrate to nitrite nitrite to nitrous oxide and nitrous oxide to nitrogen gas nitrogen fixation the process of conversion of nitrogen gas to ammonia is termed as nitrogen fixation bacteria that are able to fix nitrogen require nitrogenase enzyme nitrogenase enzyme is inactivated by oxygen there are two types of nitrogen fixing microorganisms freeliving and symbiotic o freeliving nitrogen fixing bacteria they are abundantly found in the rhizosphere rhizosphere is the soil immediately surrounding plant root eg azotobacter sp many cyanobacteria are also able to fix nitrogen eg nostoc these organisms exhibit mechanisms to prevent the exposure of nitrogenase enzyme to the atmospheric oxygen azotobacter sp high rate of aerobic respiration cyanobacteria heterocyst some anaerobic bacteria such as clostridium sp also fixes nitrogen o symbiotic nitrogenfixing microorganism they play an important role in agricultural crops such as leguminous crops soybean beans peas and peanuts these symbiotic nitrogenfixing bacteria are commonly known as rhizobia leguminous plants are specially adapted to facilitate symbiotic nitrogen fixation plants form root nodules where anaerobic conditions and nutrients for bacteria are given bacteria fixes nitrogen and make it bio available to be used by the plant some nonleguminous plants can also fix nitrogen symbiotically with different microbial combinations lichen a combination of fungus and an algae or cyanobacteria also fixes nitrogen in rice paddy waters a small freefloating fern azoa fixes nitrogen symbiotically with anabaena sp,soil provides a rich environment for microorganisms supporting diverse communities essential for nutrient cycling and organic matter decomposition key roles of microorganisms in soil include mineralization the breakdown of organic matter by bacteria and fungi into simple inorganic materials like carbon dioxide co and water ho recycling nutrients and cleaning the environment carbon cycle autotrophic organisms like plants and cyanobacteria convert atmospheric co into organic compounds through photosynthesis chemoheterotrophs including animals and protozoa depend on these organic compounds releasing co back into the atmosphere via respiration microorganisms also decompose dead matter returning carbon to the soil and atmosphere nitrogen cycle essential for protein and nucleic acid synthesis nitrogen undergoes various transformations ammonification decomposing proteins into ammonia nh using enzymes nitrification conversion of ammonia into nitrates no by nitrifying bacteria denitrification reduction of nitrates back into nitrogen gas n under anaerobic conditions releasing nitrogen into the atmosphere nitrogen fixation conversion of atmospheric nitrogen n into bioavailable forms like ammonia this can occur through freeliving bacteria eg azotobacter or symbiotic bacteria eg rhizobium in legumes overall microorganisms play vital roles in maintaining soil health and promoting plant growth
microorganisms in the soil directly interact with plants interactions in the soil such as rhizosphere mycorrhizae and endophytes with symbiotic relationship of bacteria fungi and plant cells these microorganisms are beneficial to the plants in numerous ways such as nitrogen fixation increased uptake of water and nutrients such as phosphorous secretion of plant hormones such as indole acetic acid increases iron uptake at iron limiting conditions and defense against pathogens in return plants provide organic compounds essential for the microorganisms rhizosphere this is a kind of symbiotic interaction between plant roots and soil surrounding the root surface for about few millimeters this microecological zone is called rhizosphere rhizosphere is considered as the most biodiverse and dynamic habitat on earth microorganisms in the rhizosphere feed on the compounds exuded by roots such as sugars amino acids and various aromatic compounds microorganisms compete antagonize using antimicrobial compounds with each other for resources such as nutrients space and water in the rhizosphere bacteria are the most numerous organisms in the rhizosphere three most common genera of bacteria inhabiting rhizosphere are pseudomonas bacillus and agrobacterium root exudates act as chemical signals for bacteria to move towards the root surface both pathogenic and symbiotic fungi associate with the rhizosphere mycorrhizae mycorrhizae myco fungus rhiza root are symbiotic association between plant roots with fungi all most all land plants have symbiotic association with one or more mycorrhizal fungi mycorrhizal fungi extend the surface area over which nutrients and water can be taken up by the plant they can reach small pores in soil where plant roots cannot reach and uptake nutrients most significantly mycorrhizae increase uptake of immobile nutrients such as phosphorous zinc and copper in return mycorrhiza receive organic carbon from the plant role of soil microorganisms in improving soil quality free living soil microorganisms and those associated with root surfaces play a major role in improving soil quality microorganisms are involved in the formation of stable soilaggregates which are characteristics of good soil structure in fertile soils fungal filaments actinomycetes filaments and polysaccharide gumsslimes produced by bacteria are involved in soil aggregation formation,microorganisms in soil engage in beneficial interactions with plants enhancing growth and soil quality through symbiotic relationships key interactions include rhizosphere this dynamic zone around plant roots only a few millimeters thick hosts diverse microorganisms that feed on root exudates like sugars and amino acids in this competitive environment bacteria particularly genera such as pseudomonas bacillus and agrobacterium thrive by utilizing antimicrobial compounds to secure resources the rhizosphere is essential for nutrient uptake and plant health mycorrhizae mycorrhizal fungi form symbiotic associations with plant roots significantly increasing the surface area for nutrient and water absorption these fungi are crucial for the uptake of immobile nutrients like phosphorus zinc and copper in exchange plants provide organic carbon to the fungi soil quality improvement microorganisms contribute to soil structure by forming stable aggregates fungal filaments actinomycetes and bacterial polysaccharides help bind soil particles together enhancing soil fertility and overall quality these interactions illustrate the critical role of microorganisms in sustaining plant health and improving soil conditions
contamination routes of drinking water drinking water resources can be contaminated with infectious disease causing organisms or chemical pollutants since water undergoes a filtering of microorganisms when pass through the soil into deeper layers generally water from springs and deep wells are of good quality in microbial point of view drinking water can be contaminated by dangerous pathogens when feces enter the water supply many diseases are disseminated by the fecal oral route of transmission in which pathogens are shed in human or animal feces contaminate water and ingested via drinking examples for diseases spread by water waterborne diseases are typhoid fever cholera diarrhea ete contamination of drinking water by chemical pollutants is a global issue industry domestic and agriculture sectors release a large amount of chemicals that leach from the soil surface to groundwater most of these chemicals are resistant to biodegradation most freshwaters such as tanks often contain excessive amounts of nitrates and phosphates that come from agricultural fertilizer and household chemicals such as detergents accumulation of excessive amounts of such nutrients cause eutrophication and flourish the growth of cyanobacteria and algae they are toxic to humans this kind of dense growth of cyanobacteria and algae is called algal blooms various industries also release chemicals that are nonbiodegradable they too can contaminate drinking water supplies water supplies can be contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms such as samonella spp shigella sp and vibrio sp that causes infectious diseases such as typhoid and cholera therefore it is essential to detect the presence of such microorganisms before the consumption to prevent disease outbreak however it is not practical to test water samples to look for pathogens because pathogens may present only in small numbers and might not be included in the test sample on the other hand since the testing for pathogens take time discovery of pathogens in the laboratory takes time and it will be too late to prevent an outbreak of the disease therefore it is important to test water samples routinely for indicator organisms which will indicate potential contamination of water supply by pathogens one of the major criteria for an indicator organism is that it should be consistently present in human feces in large numbers this ensures the presence of indicator organism providing evidence for contamination of water supply with human feces sri lanka and many other countries use coliform bacteria as an indicator organism to test drinking water quality coliforms are aerobic or facultative anaerobic gramnegative nonendospore forming rod shaped bacteria that ferment lactose to form gas within 48 hours in a lactose broth medium at 35 c coliforms constitute a large portion of human intestinal microflora they are nonpathogenic line in the intestine therefore presence of coliforms in water indicates fecal contamination however there are some coliforms found in plant and soil samples there are specialized test to distinguish coliforms that has fecal origin from coliforms present in plant and soil samples coliform test is routinely carried out by laboratories of the national water supply and drainage board to determine water quality of drinking water waterborne diseases pathogenic organisms that are frequently transmitted through water cause infections in the intestinal tract such as typhoid paratyphoid cholera gastroenteritis and dysentery process of drinking water treatment drinking water that comes from various water supplies can be polluted at any time therefore water needs to be purified before consumption for our health and safety the idea of water purification is not to sterilize water but to make water free of diseasecausing organisms there are three main steps in an urban water treatment plant they are sedimentation and coagulation filtration disinfection i sedimentation and coagulation this is the first step if water is turbid cloudy water is allowed to stand in a holding tank for a period of time to allow settling down of particles suspended in water this occurs in large reservoirs where water remains for a holding period during which large particulate matter settles to the bottom sedimentation is enhanced by adding alum aluminum potassium sulphate which produces a sticky precipitate many microorganisms as well as finely suspended matter are removed in this manner ii filtration after sedimentation and coagulation water is filtered by passing through beds of fine sand filtration removes protozoan cysts and other microorganism microorganisms are trapped by surface absorption onto the sand particles this removes about 99 of bacteria some urban treatment plants additionally use activated carbon for the removal of toxic chemicals iil disinfection the final step in water treatment is disinfection water can be disinfected by several methods chlorination is one of the most commonly used methods it kills pathogenic bacteria disinfection by ozone o is another method ozone is highly reactive it kills microorganisms by oxidation ozone has become a preferred method of disinfection since it leaves no taste or odor and has little residual effect aste water sewage management wastewater includes water from household use such as water used for toilets and washing water from urban drainage systems and from industry many developing countries and some developed counties still do not have proper wastewater treatment mechanisms principles and main steps in purification of industrial waste water i primary treatment following steps are involved in the primary treatment large floating materials are screened out removal of sand removal of oil and grease solid matter settles out in sedimentation tanks sludge collected and removed no biological activity is used here primary treatment removes 2535 organic matter ii secondary treatment following steps are involved in the secondary treatment the liquid flowing out of primary treatment enters the secondary treatment stage during this treatment waste water is aerated to facilitate the growth of aerobic bacteria and rapid microbial oxidation one of two systems used are activated sludge and trickling filter inactivated sludge vigorous aeration is done mechanically in trickling filters waste water is slowly sprinkled or sprayed over a bed of rocky material and allowed to trickle in this process microorganisms grow on the filter bed and oxidize organic matter in secondary treatment 7595 of organic material is oxidized o the liquid flowing through these systems are then disinfected and allowed to flow into natural waters o sludge remaining from both treatments is sent to an anaerobic sludge digester where anaerobic decomposition convert the organic material in the sludge finally to methane and co biogas o digested sludge can be used as fertilizer adverse effects of discharging large amount of waste water into natural water bodies dissemination of pathogenic microorganisms water pollution due to accumulation of biodegradable material and their decomposition products decomposition which may consume large amounts of oxygen in water affecting aquatic organisms high bod biological oxygen demand anaerobic decomposition leading to bad smells,drinking water contamination occurs through infectious organisms and chemical pollutants often resulting from fecal contamination and industrial runoff key points include contamination sources waterborne diseases such as typhoid and cholera are spread via the fecaloral route when pathogens from feces contaminate water chemical pollutants including nitrates and phosphates from agricultural fertilizers contribute to eutrophication and algal blooms which can be toxic indicator organisms to detect contamination coliform bacteria are used as indicator organisms as their presence suggests fecal pollution testing for these organisms helps prevent disease outbreaks water treatment processes to ensure safe drinking water three main treatment steps are employed sedimentation and coagulation involves settling suspended particles using alum to clarify water filtration removes microorganisms and impurities through fine sand beds disinfection common methods include chlorination and ozonation to kill pathogens wastewater management effective wastewater treatment involves two stages primary treatment screens out large debris and settles solids removing about 2535 of organic matter secondary treatment aerates wastewater to promote aerobic bacteria oxidizing 7595 of organic material before disinfection and discharge into natural waters these processes are essential to safeguard public health and protect aquatic ecosystems from pollution
nature of solid wastes solid waste include materials such as plant and animal residues food waste paper plastic polythene and glass among these organic wastes such as plant and animal residues and food wastes are rapidly degradable however synthetic materials such as plastic and polythene are not easily degraded and tend to accumulate continuously proper management of solid waste ensure community health and environmental safety accumulation of unmanaged waste in big piles in the open environment can lead to soil air and water pollution which is harmful for the environment and organisms in contact with the polluted environment environmental and hygienic importance of recycling solid wastes open dumping of waste provide breeding grounds for mosquitoes flies other insects and rats these organisms serve as vectors for dangerous diseases such as dengue chikungunya various food borne diseases and leptospirosis contaminated water resources have the risk of spreading water borne diseases such as typhoid paratyphoid cholera dysentery and gastroenteritis piles of waste at public and residential area often create social issues due to unpleasant smell generated during anaerobic digestion of waste heavy piles of waste sometimes can be dangerous due to accumulation of methane generated during anaerobic digestion of waste accumulation of methane can cause explosion and fire groundwater can be polluted by the leachate of waste piles leachate means liquid pass through the waste extracting the dissolved and the suspended matter from the waste therefore solid waste must be properly managed using appropriate technology which is socially accepted and environment friendly methods of minimizing problems created by solid wastes solid waste management 1 sorting and recycling in many countries municipal solid waste is sorted into kitchen waste plant material paper plastic glass etc and collected into separate containers sorting allows separation of waste that can be recycled such as paper plastic and glass although paper is presumably biodegradable it is not easily degraded since microorganisms cannot effectively attack papers when the waste is placed into large compacted dumping sites 2 degradation decomposition of organic matter readily degradable organic matter such as kitchen and garden waste is subjected to natural microbial degradation by the process of composting resulting compost is used in agriculture and gardening compost generate additional income to the waste management authorities such as municipal council anaerobic condition in the pile of compost promote the activity of methanogenic bacteria the methane gas they produce can be collected to generate electricity 3 sanitary land filling sanitary landfills are one of the most popular forms of waste disposal primarily because they are the least expensive way to dispose the waste more than fourfifths of municipal solid waste is disposed in landfills a sanitary landfill is an engineered means of disposal of waste in a sanitary landfill waste is spread in layers on a piece of property usually on marginal or sub marginal land the objective is to spread the layers and then compact them tightly greatly reducing the volume of the waste the waste is then covered by soil a landfill should not be located in areas with high ground water levels much of the waste in a sanitary landfill will decompose through biological and chemical processes that produce solid liquid and gaseous products,solid waste comprises various materials including organic residues food waste paper plastic and glass while organic wastes are readily degradable synthetic materials like plastics accumulate in the environment posing significant pollution risks proper solid waste management is crucial for community health and environmental safety due to the following concerns environmental impact unmanaged waste can lead to soil air and water pollution affecting both the environment and organisms health risks open dumping creates breeding grounds for disease vectors like mosquitoes and rats increasing the risk of diseases such as dengue cholera and gastroenteritis contaminated water sources can spread waterborne diseases while leachate from waste piles can pollute groundwater social issues accumulated waste generates unpleasant odors and may lead to methane buildup creating fire and explosion hazards effective solid waste management methods include sorting and recycling separating waste into categories allows for recycling of materials like paper plastic and glass minimizing landfill usage decomposition of organic matter composting kitchen and garden waste enables microbial degradation producing compost for agriculture and capturing methane for energy sanitary landfilling engineered landfills provide a controlled environment for waste disposal allowing for biological decomposition while minimizing environmental impact proper management practices can significantly reduce pollution and enhance public health
why food is spoiled by microorganisms all food materials used for human consumption are of plant or animal origin microorganisms inhabit nearly every niche on earth and food supply which are of plant or animal origin is no exception food have a natural micro biota and also get contaminated with microorganisms in nature during handling and processing food materials contain nutrients and water act as culture media for growth of microorganisms the nutrients present in the food materials the same that is required for the growth of many microorganisms therefore food serves as a culture medium such as nutrient broth numerous bacteria yeast and molds will grow in this broth physical chemical and biological changes occur in food spoilage growth of microorganisms in food changes physical chemical and biological structures of food and making them unfit for consumption which is termed as food spoilage microorganisms growing in food are heterotrophic bacteria and fungi during this process they breakdown carbohydrates proteins and fats to obtain energy and other requirements for their own growth various extra cellular enzymes such as amylase pectinase cellulase protease and lipase are secreted by contaminant microorganisms in order to complete the above process as a result of this major constituents of food undergo chemical physical and biological changes 3 presence and concentrations of gases in the environment presence or absence of o determine the type of contaminants causing food spoilage there are both aerobic as well as anaerobic microbes cause food spoilage internal factors influence on food spoilage internal factors are those factors that are present in food itself 1 ph most microorganisms grow best at ph values around 70 66 75 and very few grow below 40 in general molds and yeasts can grow over a wide range of ph from very low to very high ph 2 10 bacteria in general grow between ph 5 7 fruits such as limes orange and banana are likely to be spoiled by molds and yeast most animal foods such as beef chicken fish milk are susceptible to bacterial mold and yeast spoilage 2 moisture content drying is the oldest method of preserving food which is based on reducing moisture content high moisture containing food such as meat and fish are spoiled by bacteria low moisture containing food such as biscuits and bread are spoiled by molds dried milk powder or flour which contains very low moisture are not easily spoiled by bacteria or molds salt and sugar containing foods available water is low are generally spoiled by halophillic bacteria salted foods osmophilic and xerophillic molds yeast sugary foods 3 nutrient content water source of energy nitrogen vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients for growth of microorganisms nutrient rich food are easily spoiled by microorganisms eg milk meat 4 biological structure the natural covering of some foods protect the food from the entry and the damage cause by the spoilage microorganisms eg outer covering of fruits shell of egg food borne pathogens of humans typhoid salmonella typhi dysentery shigella cholera vibrio cholera food poisoning staphylococcus aureus botulism clostridium botulinum aflatoxin aspergillus flavus effects of food spoilage on human health some microorganisms produce various toxic substances in food which cause food poisoning or food intoxication when consumed illness may result from consuming food spoiled by microorganisms microorganisms grow and multiply in food increasing the numbers of microbial cells and also produce toxic chemical substances ingestion of large numbers of microbial cells and their toxic chemicals by any individual through highly contaminated food may develop disease these diseases illnesses are of two kinds a food borne infections in food borne infections the contaminating pathogenic microorganisms enter the body of the individual consumed spoiled food and inside the host they grow multiply and also produce toxins which cause symptoms of the characteristic disease eg salmonella typhi typhoid fever shigella dysentery vibrio cholerae cholera b food intoxication in food intoxication the spoiled food contains toxins produced due to microbial growth any individual who consumes such contaminated food containing toxins will develop symptoms of the disease within a short period of time eg food poisoning staphylococcus aureus botulism clostridium botulinum aflatoxins produced by fungi aspergillus flavus in general all the above illnesses are referred to as due to food poisoning c viruses also entero viruses cause some food borne illnesses,microorganisms play a significant role in food spoilage which is defined as the deterioration of food making it unfit for consumption food serves as a culture medium for various bacteria yeasts and molds due to its nutrient and moisture content as these microorganisms grow they secrete extracellular enzymes eg amylase protease that break down carbohydrates proteins and fats leading to physical chemical and biological changes in the food key factors influencing food spoilage include ph most bacteria thrive around neutral ph 6675 while molds and yeasts can grow in a wider ph range 210 moisture content highmoisture foods meat fish are more prone to bacterial spoilage whereas lowmoisture foods biscuits may spoil due to molds nutrient content nutrientrich foods milk meat are more susceptible to spoilage biological structure natural coverings of some foods can protect against spoilage microorganisms food spoilage can lead to foodborne illnesses which can be classified into foodborne infections pathogens multiplying in the host and food intoxication toxic substances present in spoiled food common pathogens include salmonella typhi shigella and clostridium botulinum
food and agriculture organization fao defines aquaculture as the farming of aquatic organisms including fish molluscs crustaceans and aquatic plants importance of aquaculture farming edible aquatic organisms is accepted as one of the best solutions for feeding the ever increasing human population a healthy diet high in protein is necessary to ensure that growing population does not succumb to sicknesses and diseases due to lack of essential nutrients harvests from wild sources of fish crustaceans and other aquatic species cannot keep up with the demand presented by the growing human population trying to match the demand through commercial fishing would eventually result in overfishing and the loss of those species entirely it is accepted that while aquaculture is essential to meet the human demand for fish and fishery products it also relieves the strain on wild species and allow them to continue to be a significant source of food for humans general characteristics of species that could be cultured selected species should withstand the climate of the region in which it is cultured it should grow well should have a fast growth in prevailing physical and chemical parameters of water in the area it should be easy to breed breeding techniques should be available so that sufficient number of fertilized eggsearly fry could be obtained easily techniques of incubation of fertilized eggs and rearing techniques of hatchlingsearly fry should be available so that the production of sufficient number of young organisms seed would be easy under culture conditions if the eggs larvae fry fingerlings juveniles and adults of the species are hardy it is easier for the hatchery manager farmer handling hardy species is easy food and feeding habits of each developmental stage of the species should be known easy to provide nutritionally balanced diet for each developmental stage it should not reproduce in growout pondstanks if it reaches sexual maturation relatively late it is advantageous it should accept formulated food and grow well it should be an efficient converter of economical foodstuffs if it is accidentally released to natural water bodies there should not be adverse environmental impacts it should tolerate high population density and grow well having resistance to common diseases is advantageous it should satisfy consumers by the taste nutritive value texture of flesh or appearance body color color patterns ornamental fish culture ornamental fish keeping has been a hobby of humans for centuries of years initially fish that had some colours were collected from wild and maintained in garden ponds for the joy of watching their aesthetic beauty ornamental fishes lure and draw a great attention worldwide through their attractive coloration shapes and sizes of body and fins swimming behaviors ability to live under captive conditions and adaptability to live in little spaces people keep fish in their homes for variety of reasons such as for decoration childrens education enjoyment relaxation of elderly or health affected individuals prosperity and fortune of home occupants and to collect rare species and even to propagate them globally ornamental fish keeping has emerged as one of the most popular hobbies being second only to the photography species that are commonly used in freshwater ornamental fish

siamese fighting fish betta splendens kissing gourami helostoma temmincki goldfish carassius auratus koi carp cyprinus carpio see annexe 1 scientific names are not required to memorize aquarium an aquarium can be defined as a container that is designed to hold water in which living organisms can be maintained over an extended period of time aquaria vary tremendously in size shape and design ranging from a simple bottle containing some water eg an empty jam bottle is used to keep a male siamese fighting fish to a multimillion liters commercial exhibit tanks maintenance of a home aquarium there are activities that should be carried out daily weekly fortnightly and monthly in order to maintain environmental conditions water quality parameters within the optimum ranges for the fish kept in an aquarium provision of correct nutrition and maintenance of water quality within optimum ranges contribute for the wellbeing and health management of fish kept in an aquarium daily 1 feed the fish with a nutritionally balanced diet following a correct feeding regime suitable daily ration should be offered in 2 or 3 meals 2 check on the status of health while feeding and remove the affected individuals for treating in another tankbasin 3 allowing fish to adapt for the changing intensity of light to prevent unnecessary stress on fish switch on the light of the aquarium several minutes after the room lights have been on or after the day break switch off the light of the aquarium several minutes before the room lights are switched off or shortly before natural lights fades weekly 1 fish should not be fed one day per week not applicable for brood fish fry and fingerlings fortnightly 1 switch off aeration 2 rake or stir up gently the surface of the rooting medium undergravel filter medium 3 scrape excess algal growth 4 allow debris to settle 5 siphon off the debris along with 20 25 of the aquarium water 6 replace the volume siphoned out with freshwater in which temperature ph and hardness match with conditions of the water in the aquarium 7 switch on aeration monthly 1 take out some water from the aquarium in to a basin another tank bucket 2 collect the fish carefully using a hand net and introduce them into the basin tankbucket and arrange aeration to it 3 rinse rooting medium undergravel filter medium 4 remove the aeration tube from air lift scrape off any deposit algal or calcite from the opening and cleanscrape off air diffuser stones 5 introduce the siphoning tube under the filter plates and suck out the accumulated organic debris 6 check the terminals of light source 7 remove dead and dying leaves from plants 8 prune thin out and tidy the plants and replace poorly grown plants 9rearrange the filter plates and the filter medium 10 arrange the aeration and fill the aquarium halfway with clean freshwateraged aerated tap water 11 reintroduce the fish with the water and then fill the aquarium to the original level of water using aged clean freshwater no matter how much time and care is devoted things in an aquarium could go wrong from time to time equipment failure excessive algal growth poor water quality or occurrence of diseases could be the cause water turning into green frequently green algae growing on plants on aquarium dcor and on the side glasses of the aquarium indicate that the aquarium is receiving too much light the reduction of intensity andor duration of light followed by partial water exchange may prevent this situation growth of brown algae as brown encrustations on plants on aquarium dcor and on the side glasses of the aquarium are indications of insufficient illumination bluegreen algal mats on plants on aquarium dcor and on the side glasses of the aquarium indicate a high level of organic pollution physical removal of algal mats followed by partial water exchange a review of the maintenance routine with a view to prevent further accumulation of organic pollutants whether too much food are offered to fish inadequate filtration or aeration overstocking etc are required to correct the situation,aquaculture defined by the food and agriculture organization fao as the farming of aquatic organisms is essential for meeting the protein needs of the growing human population it alleviates pressure on wild fisheries and promotes sustainable food production successful aquaculture depends on selecting species that thrive in local conditions have a fast growth rate are easy to breed and exhibit resilience to diseases ornamental fish keeping is also popular providing aesthetic enjoyment and serving as a lucrative hobby to maintain a home aquarium various routine tasks are essential daily tasks feed fish with a balanced diet check their health and adjust light intensity gradually weekly tasks provide a day of fasting for fish to promote health fortnightly tasks clean the tank siphon debris and replace a portion of the water monthly tasks deep clean the aquarium check equipment and prune plants proper maintenance is critical for preventing issues like algal overgrowth and ensuring the health of the fish
ornamental fish kept in aquaria are susceptible to numerous diseases some of the diseases are infectious and some are noninfectious infectious diseases invasion of fish tissues by a disease causing agent a pathogenic virus bacterium fungus or an obligatory oppourtunistic parasite multiplication of it inon fish tissues and increasing its population may lead to the development of an infectious disease in ornamental fish however many infectious diseases could be avoidedprevented through better management practices bmps such as maintenance of water quality correct stocking density of compatible fish with compatible plants correct feeding regime to keep the immunity of fish at a higher level and through correct biosecurity measures to prevent contamination by pathogens ex quarantining new fish plants and other aquarium dcor common diseases of fresh water ornamental fish species aquatic organisms are susceptible to various diseases caused by different groups of pathogens bacterial fin rot and gill rot are bacterial infections that affect the health of fish while haemorrhagic septicaemia and columnaris disease are also caused by bacteria leading to severe health issues fungal infections such as external mycosis are caused by fungi which can adversely affect the skin and overall health of fish fish white spot disease commonly referred to as ich disease is caused by unicellular external obligatory parasites leading to significant mortality in infected fish populations additionally trichodinosis is caused by unicellular external opportunistic parasites that can exploit weakened fish lastly gill and skin infestation occurs due to obligatory or opportunistic parasites specifically gill flukes and skin flukes which can result in respiratory distress and skin damage collectively these diseases highlight the diverse range of pathogens affecting aquatic health necessitating effective management and treatment strategies environmental impact of ornamental fish culture some impacts of ornamental fish culture are beneficial while some could be harmful the first benefit of ornamental fish culture is species conservation and production of species that are difficult to obtain from the wild breeding and rearing of approximately 90 of freshwater ornamental fish traded globally are done under captive conditions there is some environmental benefit or elimination of environmental damage via those breeding programs the golden arrowana and tiger barb puntius tetrazona are two species that have been conserved via ornamental fish production in addition to the sale of fish to hobbyists fish are also being reintroduced to habitats in which they have been eliminated invasive ornamental fishesaquatic plants that are accidentally escaped to natural environment could affect a wide range of native organisms from zooplankton to mammals across multiple levels of biological organizations ranging from the genome to the ecosystem with imported live fish nonindigenous disease causing agents may also come in to a country haphazard use of broadspectrum antibiotics and other chemicals as preventivetherapeutic treatments and release of treated water containing those medications in to the natural environment may cause antibiotic resistance resistance to chemicals used on pathogenic microorganisms including human pathogenic bacteria,ornamental fish are susceptible to various infectious and noninfectious diseases caused by pathogens such as viruses bacteria fungi and parasites infectious diseases arise when these agents invade fish tissues leading to issues like bacterial fin rot gill rot and ich disease many infections can be prevented through better management practices bmps that maintain water quality proper stocking density and biosecurity measures such as quarantining new arrivals ornamental fish culture has both positive and negative environmental impacts benefits include species conservation and the breeding of difficulttocatch species which can reduce pressure on wild populations for example species like the golden arrowana are preserved through captive breeding however risks arise from invasive species escaping into natural ecosystems and the introduction of nonnative disease agents the misuse of antibiotics and chemicals in fish culture can lead to antibiotic resistance potentially affecting both fish and human health

tissue culture and micropropagation are two most interesting areas under biotechnology in general cell or tissue culture is culture of free living cells or group of similar cells more specifically tissue culture is the ability to establish plant tissues cells callus and protoplasts plant organs embryos shoots roots in aseptic in vitro culture the most common benefit of tissue culture is that of cloning or mass production of genetically identical organisms the main concept behind plant tissue culture is totipotent 1e a single cell has the genetic programme to grow into an entire new plant the concept of totipotent was first introduced by the scientists matthias schleiden and theodor schwann who postulated the cell theory in 1838 a tissue culture medium generally consists of inorganic salts organic substances water and gelling agent macro and micronutrients in appropriate ratios make the inorganic salt component the organic substances include carbon energy source usually sucrose plant growth regulators cytokinins and auxins vitamins miscellaneous compounds agar is incorporated as the gelling agent these gels provide physical support for the explant and increase the aeration of the medium there are several commercial media available for tissue culture eg murashige and skoog or ms medium etc importance of tissue culture technique 1 rapid multiplication of clones mass propagation of specific clones genetic uniformity genotype modifications ability to produce plants in large numbers in a small space production of pathogenfree plants all year around production of plants bo saee ability to produce plants which do not produce viable seeds examples for tissuecultured plants are anthurium anthurium andreanum banan pineapple dragon fruit grafting and other propagation methods used in floriculture industry seed propagation method sexual propagation the most common and widely used propagation method for plants is seeds therefore production of high quality seeds is a prime importance in the horticulture sector growers wish to have high quality seeds with higher percentage of germination and higher viability and free of diseases and pest damages seed germination is the beginning of the next sexual generation of a particular plant for a seed to initiate germination following conditions must be completed 1 the seeds must be viable 2 the seed must be subjected to suitable environmental conditions 3 dormancies existing should be overcome anthrium and orchid plants can be produced using seed propagation methods at present tissue culture is culture methods vegetative propagation methods used in the floriculture industry in nature some plants can produce sexually via seeds as well as asexually or vegetatively in vegetatively propagated plants the new plant is nearly always genetically identical to the parent the various methods of vegetative propagation include separation and division cuttings layering and grafting most of these vegetative propagations methods are used in the floriculture industry separation and division separation is a propagation method where naturally detachable structures eg rhizomes bulbs and corms are used during division it involves cutting or dividing the plant into sections with both roots and stems eg stolons and rooted runners cuttings cutting propagation is one of the most important clonal regeneration technique used in horticulture industry for ornamental plants fruit trees adventitious root formation is a prerequisite in this process a piece of plant from the stem leaf root or leafy bud can generate into a fully developed plant fig 102 the roots arising from stem leaf or bud tissue are known as adventitious roots eg roses ficus dracaena sp african violets croton although stem and leafbud cuttings need only a new adventitious root system to be formed for root and leaf cuttings both the new shoot and root systems need to be formed propagation via leaf cuttings begonia african violet snake plant sansevieria layering a method of vegetative propagation where stems are rooted while attached to the parent plant some plants have a natural tendency to regenerate by selflayering forming adventitious roots from the stem where they touch the soil strawberry cynodon sp layering technique is a good way of getting small number of new plants with relative certainty because the new plant is nourished by its parent plant until roots are formed and rooted grafting this involves joining two separate plants so that they later function as one healthy plant that has the best characteristics of two parent plants a root system is provided by one plant known as root stock or understock and the desired top part by the other plant known as scion eg roses during a graft union it is vital that the cambium of the scion is placed in close contact with the rootstock cambium fig 104 initially a callus mass of undifferentiated parenchyma cells bridge is formed between the scion and rootstock in a successful graft these callus cells are originated from the scion and the rootstock,tissue culture and micropropagation are vital techniques in biotechnology that enable the cloning and mass production of genetically identical plants from a single totipotent cell which can develop into an entire plant the process involves growing plant tissues or organs in an aseptic environment using a nutrientrich culture medium containing inorganic salts sucrose plant growth regulators vitamins and agar as a gelling agent importance of tissue culture rapid multiplication of clones genetic uniformity and genotype modifications production of pathogenfree plants yearround cultivation in addition to tissue culture propagation methods such as seed propagation vegetative propagation cuttings layering and grafting are commonly used in the floriculture industry each method allows for the production of plants while ensuring high quality and viability key terms tissue culture growth of plant cells or tissues in a controlled environment micropropagation a method for producing many plants from a small amount of tissue totipotent a single cells ability to develop into a complete organism adventitious roots roots that form from nonroot tissues grafting joining two plant parts to grow as one plant
importance of food preservation most kinds of foods are readily spoiled unless they are preserved using suitable methods of preservation food preservation ensures that food could be stored for a particular period during some seasons over production of certain food occurs and the excess production could be preserved using suitable methods and stored to be used later food preservation protects the food that is available for human consumption reducing the food loss food preservation food preservation is the process of treating and handling food to stop or greatly slow down spoilage loss of quality edibility or nutritive value caused or accelerated by microorganisms food could be preserved before undergoing spoilage using suitable techniques which could prevent unnecessary wastage and contribute greatly to meet food requirement of growing human population by eliminating avoidable losses making more nutritive food items from low grade raw commodity using proper processing and fortification diverting a portion of food materials presently being fed to animals for human consumption by way of processing and fortifying low grade food and organic wastes and byproducts into nutritive animal feed principles of food preservation it is essential to prevent contamination of harvested food from damaging agents by hygienic handling transportation and storage three basic principles of food preservation prevention of entry of microorganisms into food aseptic prevention of the growth and activity of microorganisms in food remove or killing of microorganisms in food methods of food preservation food preservation methods aim to prevent contamination in the first place and to remove or reduce the numbers of contaminants preservation of food is achieved by application of physical chemical andor biological methods the techniques may be applied separately or in combination microorganisms need a source of food and water and they also need a suitable ph and temperature to grow one or several of the living conditions needed for the growth of microorganisms have to be removed by the food preservation technique drying one of the oldest methods of food preservation is drying food is dried mostly in the sun and drying reduces water activity of the food sufficiently to prevent or delay microbial growth allowing food to keep for weeks most types of grains are dried to increase shelf life wheat corn oats rice rye and barley are left to dry to prevent spoilage hams are a great example of meats preserved through drying in ovens thermal heat treatment heating food is an effective way of preserving it because the great majority of harmful pathogens are killed at temperatures close to the boiling point of water in this respect heating is a form of food preservation a preliminary step in many other forms of food preservation especially forms that make use of packaging is to heat the food to temperatures sufficiently high to destroy pathogens in many cases food is actually cooked prior to their being packaged and stored,food preservation is essential for preventing spoilage and extending the shelf life of food products it involves treating and handling food to significantly slow down spoilage caused by microorganisms thereby reducing food loss preservation methods are crucial during periods of overproduction allowing excess food to be stored for later use the principles of food preservation include prevention of microorganism entry ensuring aseptic conditions to keep food free from contaminants inhibition of microbial growth preventing the growth and activity of microorganisms in stored food removal or killing of microorganisms using methods to eliminate harmful pathogens various techniques including drying and thermal treatments are used to preserve food drying reduces water content slowing microbial growth eg grains and hams thermal treatment involves heating food to kill pathogens often before packaging these methods contribute to food security by reducing waste enhancing the nutritional quality of food and converting lowgrade raw materials into more nutritious products
freezing and chilling freezing is perhaps the most common of all modern food preservation methods both commercially and domestically commercially freezing is done in different types of freezers under extremely fast freezing or fast freezing bringing the temperature of fishmeat down to a value between 18 to 30 oc within 15 minutes to 2 hours to preserve the quality frozen products are stored in cold rooms at 18 to 30 c until distributed in order to prevent the growth and spreading of spoilage microorganismsthe extreme cold prevent microbial growth storage of food fruits fruit juices vegetables fish meat etc in refrigerators at low temperatures chilling at 4 to 7 c reduces the growth and activities of spoilage microorganisms preserving food for a short period for 10 to 14 days salting salting also is an older form of preserving raw foods salt has an ability to suck the moisture out of food through the process of osmosis when the food is totally dry from salting growth of microorganisms are inhibited meat is commonly preserved through salting salting and drying in preparation of dried fish anchovy tuna etc fish are first salted and then dried in sun addition of salt makes the removal of water fast and the salt inhibits microbial growth on fish even though some moisture is still remaining in flesh addition of sugar sugaring sugar is used in syrup form to preserve fruits and in crystallized form to preserve some food items like ginger and orange peel some fruits are glazed with sugar syrup for the fruits to get a superficial protective coating some fresh fruits are cooked with sugar and then dried high sucrose concentration produces osmotic stress on microorganisms and protects the food from microbial spoilage eg jam sugared toffees made with ash pumpkin smoking smoking is the process that cooks flavors and preserves food exposing it to the smoke from burning wood smoke is antimicrobial and antioxidant and most often meats and fish are preserved by smoking the aroma generated by hydrocarbons of burning wood enhances the taste flavour and adds smokiness to the meatfish while preserving chemicals chemicals inhibit growth and activity of microorganisms while some chemical compounds can kill the microorganisms eg preservation of fruit juice and production of pickles using chemicals such as sodium benzoate edta acetic acid and brine solution preservation of food through radiation the type of radiation used in processing food materials is limited to radiations from high energy gamma rays xrays and accelerated electrons processing of food by radiation involves exposure of food to short wave radiation energy to achieve a specific purpose such as extension of shelflife insect disinfestation and elimination of food borne pathogens and parasites eg packets of spices ground meat etc postharvest losses food losses that occur along the food supply chain from harvesting of a crop until its consumption is defined as postharvest losses product quality at harvest is influenced by when and how the harvest is done preharvest factors such as source of seed and quality that has been set during growth also contribute for the product quality at harvest product quality at harvest could be lost further during harvesting handling transporting storage domestic processing and distribution the postharvest losses can broadly be categorized as weight loss due to spoilage quality loss nutritional loss seed viability loss and commercial loss postharvest losses in production of cereals eg paddy fruits and vegetables during harvesting untimely harvesting paddy should be harvested at the best time considering the variety of paddy delayed harvesting of paddy may result quality loss nutritional loss seed viability loss weight loss and commercial loss those losses could be further increased if paddy fields are flooded due to heavy rains just before harvesting if paddy is harvested earlier it requires more drying drying cost grains with high moisture content are susceptible to mold growth insect infestation resulting broken grains and low milling yield with significant commercial losses in addition depending on the method of harvest part of the paddy crop may be left and ploughed in to soil which is a commercial loss fruits and vegetables also should be harvested at the best time could vary with the variety to have maximum quality and to obtain the highest quantity if harvested too early the crop will not be ripematured enough and if harvested too late it may spoil quickly leading to quality loss and nutritional loss finally resulting economical losses harvesting of fruits and vegetables should be done without allowing physical mechanical damages to occur if damages occur quality and storage life will be reduced as spoilage microorganisms will quickly invade through damaged areas during handling high shattering loss of paddy seed could occur which is a commercial loss harvested paddy should be dried bagged and stored temporarily without allowing the paddy seed to absorb moisture and greater attacks by insects and rodents in order to protect the quality harvested fruits and vegetables should be handled hygienically kept in plastic cartons which could be kept in a shade temporarily harvested fruitsvegetables should be sorted to remove damaged infested moldy and overripe fruits overmatured vegetables sorting will reduce spoilage during transport and storage transportation poor road infrastructure along with improper and poorly maintained modes of transportation results in large spillage of paddy seed and high contamination multiple movements of crop is another major reason for high transportation losses sometimes bagged paddy is loaded and unloaded from vehicles several times before it is milled during each movement some grains are lost as spillage during handling and transportation of rice 2 10 losses occur in southeast asia those losses could be minimized using well planned better mode of transportation with an efficient bulk handling system during the transportation of fruitsvegetables arranged at the bottom of stacked crates could be damaged by the weight of the produce kept above use of crates that could be stacked without putting the weight on produce at the bottom would solve this issue use of straw or something soft in between layers of produce within a crate will reduce the damages due to rubbing rough handling of crates containing produce should be avoided to prevent possible damages to the produce uncontrolled changes of temperature and excessive shaking could do great damages to the produce during transport in tropical countries if transportation is carried out at night time produce could be protected by high temperature of the day time storage storage plays a vital role in the food supply chain although losses occur at each stage of the supply chain from production to consumer level storage losses are considered most critical in developing countries as maximum losses occur during the storage generally after harvesting milling grains are stored for short or long periods of storage as food reserves and as seeds for next season poor storage infrastructure allows rice to absorb excess moisture rice grains with excess moisture to be infested easily by insect pests followed by invasion of spoilage microorganisms rice to be attacked by rodents and other pests provision of proper storage infrastructure could preventreduce the losses that occur during storage of paddymilled rice uncontrolled changes of temperature could encourage spoilage microorganisms to grow faster spoiling the stored produce fruits and vegetables storage of fruits and vegetables should be done in properly chilled rooms to reduce the rate of spoilage domestic processing in domestic processing of different food types at different areas of sri lanka following methods are used the postharvest loss of food processing could be due to early harvesting improper handling etc postharvest losses that could occur during domestic processing could be reduced by following correct procedures eg harvesting at the right time hygienic handling to prevent microbial contaminations and proper storage to prevent attacks of insects rodents etc drying paddyrice and other cereals drying after thermal treatment jack fruit etc pasteurization milk freezing fish and meat are temporarily stored in freezer compartment of a refrigerator chilling fruits vegetables etc salting lime etc salting and drying fish sugaring homemade jams use of chemicals pickles,food preservation is essential to minimize spoilage and waste in the food supply chain common methods include freezing chilling salting sugaring smoking and chemical treatments each targeting the growth of microorganisms freezing rapidly lowers food temperature to 18 to 30 c to inhibit microbial growth while chilling at 4 to 7 c preserves food for 10 to 14 days salting uses salt to draw moisture from food preventing microbial growth often combined with drying for products like fish sugaring high sugar concentrations create osmotic stress preserving fruits and other items in syrup or crystallized forms smoking exposes food to smoke which has antimicrobial properties and adds flavor chemical preservation involves using substances like sodium benzoate and acetic acid to inhibit microbial growth postharvest losses can occur due to improper harvesting handling transportation and storage which affect quality and nutritional value key strategies for reducing these losses include timely harvesting hygienic handling efficient transportation and proper storage conditions
dengue is a vector borne disease which is caused by an arbovirus which is a rna virus epidemics of dengue are reported in tropical and subtropical regions of the world the virus is transmitted by two species of mosquitoes they are aedes aegypti and aedes albopictus the transmission ofthe dengue virus is dependent on biotic and abiotic factors the biotic factors include the virus the vector and the host and the abiotic factors include temperature humidity and rainfall the dengue virus is transmitted to human via the biting of an infected female mosquito the infected humans can be symptomatic as well as asymptomatic and they are the carriers and multipliers of the virus the aedes mosquitoes are small to medium sized approximately 47 mm and it is dark in colour these mosquitoes have white markingsbands on its body and the arrangement on these bands are different in the body and the legs they live about 24 weeks depending on the environmental conditions the life cycle has four stages they are eggs larva pupa and adults the adult female mosquito lays eggs singly on the inner surface of wet containers above the water level preferably clear water initially the laid eggs are white in colour and they become shiny black colour within few minutes from deposition of the eggs these eggs are smooth long and ovoid in shape and about 1 mm long the eggs hatch within two days to become a larvae the larvae rest with an angle to the water surface if the eggs are not hatched they can undergo dormant for a period of about six months the body of larva consists of three major parts ie head thorax and abdomen after 45 days the larval stage becomes the pupa which is comma shaped and mobile the pupa becomes the adult mosquito within 12 days breeding sites the female mosquitoes lay eggs in a wide variety of artificial and natural wet containers they prefer dark colored surfaces with clear unpolluted water the breeding sites can be found in both indoor as well as outdoor they include discarded plastic containers tins clay pots yoghurt and ice cream cups bottles cans damaged ceramic items coconut shells etc water storage containers such as cement tanks barrels etc discarded automobile tyres and machinery parts building structures such as roof gutters concrete slabs etc household institutional appliances including refrigerator trays flower vases ornamental ponds squatting pans of wash rooms etc natural breeding sites such as leaf axils tree holes etc symptoms of disease dengue can affect infants young children and adults it starts with flulike symptoms sudden onset of high fever 40 c 104 f could be accompanied by any of the following symptoms they are severe headache pain behind the eyes muscle and joint pains nausea vomiting or skin rash these symptoms usually last for 27 days after incubation period of 410 days from the bite of an infected female aedes mosquito severe dengue dengue hemorrhagic fever is a potentially deadly complication due to blood plasma leaking fluid accumulation respiratory distress severe bleeding or organ impairment warning signs occur 37 days after the first symptoms in conjunction with a decrease in temperature below 38c100f and include severe abdominal pain persistent vomiting rapid breathing bleeding from the nose and gums fatigue enlargement of liver reduced number of platelets restlessness and blood in vomit the next 2448 hours of the critical stage can be lethal in which symptoms may progress to massive bleeding very low blood pressure shock and death proper medical care is needed to avoid complications and risk of shock and death dengue shock syndrome controlling measures of the vector the dengue vector controlling methods are mainly aimed at both immature and adult stage of the aedes mosquitoes integrated vector management strategy includes environmental chemical and biological controlling methods the most cost effective way is controlling the vector by eliminating its breeding sites removal of open source of water through the environmental management could be done by having continuous water supply to minimize storage of water in cement tanks barrels and other containers making mosquito proofing of water storage cement tanks domestic wells and over head tanks construction of buildings without roof gutters removal of unserviceable roof gutters regular cleaning with scrubbing of water storage tanks flower pots flower vases ant traps refrigerator trays proper disposal of solid wastes proper storage of used tyres household and garden utensils in addition to environmental management practices biological controlling methods also can be used to control the vector they include use of fish species which feed on the larval stages of the mosquito the following fish species could be introduced to water storage tanks barrels ornamental ponds etc to feed on the larval stages of these mosquitoes guppy poecilia reticulata dandi rasbora daniconius juvenile stages of tilapia the bacillus thuringiensis israelensis bti also can be used to control the dengue vectors this is a bacterium that produces an endotoxin which is toxic to the larval stages of the mosquitoes another method of mosquito control is thermal fogging which is a form of chemical method when mosquitoes are exposed to sufficient dosage of this fog they are knocked down and killed there are several limitations in vector controlling methods such as lack of sufficient knowledge in biological controlling methods when fish are used to control the vector fish could die in the absence of food in the breeding site and due to changes in water quality parameters such as ph of water in breeding site when the domesticated water containers are filled with chlorinated water it may lead to the death of the fish when bti is suggested to control the vector there could be some breeding sites that bti cant be applied chemical methods such as fogging could affect health of both humans and animals,dengue is a vectorborne disease caused by an rna virus primarily transmitted by the aedes aegypti and aedes albopictus mosquitoes it thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with its transmission influenced by biotic factors virus vector and host and abiotic factors temperature humidity and rainfall the female mosquito lays eggs in stagnant clean water leading to a fourstage life cycle egg larva pupa and adult symptoms of dengue include high fever severe headache and muscle pain with severe cases potentially leading to dengue hemorrhagic fever characterized by blood plasma leakage and low platelet counts controlling the dengue vector involves integrated strategies targeting both immature and adult mosquitoes focusing on eliminating breeding sites key control measures include environmental management regularly clean containers dispose of waste and ensure proper water storage biological control introduce fish species eg guppy tilapia that consume mosquito larvae and use bacillus thuringiensis israelensis bti to target larvae specifically chemical control apply thermal fogging to eliminate adult mosquitoes however limitations exist in each control method due to environmental changes and potential health risks
lymphatic filariasis in sri lanka filariasis is one of the oldest debilitating disease in the world this is one of the major leading causes of permanent and long term disability it does not kill people but cause permanent disability filariasis is a mosquito borne disease transmitted by a thread like nematode who lives in human lymphatic system the disease is endemic in developing countries with poor socioeconomic status and is often associate with poor environment sanitation filaria has been categorized as a neglected tropical disease parasite 90 of infections are caused by wuchereria bancrofti human is the exclusive host of w bancrofti vector in sri lanka it is transmitted solely by culex quinguefasciatus mosquito culex breeds in polluted water bodies blocked drains broken toilet pits husk pits etc the culex mosquito is small to medium in size 3 to 4 mm in length and greyblack in colour the nervures of wings of adult mosquito are beset with brown or blackish scales and the posterior margin of the wings is fringed with bristle and scales female lay eggs in the form of egg rafts that floats on the surface of water after hatching larva rests keeping its body with an angle to the water surface factors associated with transmission transmission in a community is influenced by number of infected persons prevalence density of microfilaria in blood of infected persons density of vector mosquitoes characteristics of the vector affects development of larvae frequency of human vector contact methods of transmission filariasis parasite is introduced to human body by a bite of a female adult mosquito when the mosquito suck blood from humans larval stages of parasite falls on to the skin do not inoculate in to the body as other mosquito borne disease agents then these larvae penetrate skin through the bite wound and enter into the human vascular system from here the larvae migrate to the lymphatic system within one year larvae become matured in to adult worms adult male and female worms nests and mate in lymphatic vessels and produce large number of tiny immature eggs which hatch into microfilariae microfilariae migrate from the lymphatic system and enter the blood stream microfilariae live in lungs during day time and travel to peripheral blood during night from here they transfer to mosquito when it takes a blood meal from human body ingested microfilariae transform into several larval forms and again with another bite enter into human body adult worm lives in lymphatic system for 56 years and microfilaria can lives for year when adults worms block lymphatic vessels they get distorted and lymph flow does not occur smoothly lymph tends to accumulate in dependent parts of the body legs hands testes penis and breast causing lymphedema when microfilaria lives in lungs patients develop dry cough wheezing mild fever weight loss etc fluid accumulation in scrotum manifests as hydrocele presence of microfilariae in lungs manifest as occult filariasis occult filariasis is characterized by high eosinophilic count with chronic cough and wheezing which worsen at night with dyspnea chest pain fever and weight loss clinical manifestations vary from asymptomatic to chronic lymphedema elephantiasis after entering the human body the filarial parasite l3 larva develops into an adult worm and remains silent in lymphatics for several years producing microfilaria these patients are asymptomatic and can only be detected through active surveillance presence of adult parasite in lymphatic system for a longer period gives rise to late manifestations they are due to dilatation of lymphatic vessels followed by their dysfunction accumulation of fluid in tissues and increased risk of infection lymphoedema with recurrent infections skin of oedematous extremities becomes thickened and later on gives rise to warty nodular papillomatous appearance lymphoedema is graded according to the state of oedema and appearance of the skin controlling measures personal protection from mosquito bites prevent mosquito bites by the use of mosquito nets repellants long sleeve shirts and trousers elimination of breeding sites repair broken septic tanks cleaning drainages prevent dumping garbage in to drains chemical control of aquatic plants in water reservoirs prevent creation of breeding sites use of larvivorous fish such as guppy nalahandaya in water bodies screening healthy population with night blood films and detect people who harbor the infection but do not show any symptoms and treat them monitor vector mosquito population for infectivity limitations of controlling methods lack of sufficient knowledge among people about the disease the vector method of transmission breeding sites and controlling measures,lymphatic filariasis is a debilitating mosquitoborne disease caused primarily by the nematode wuchereria bancrofti which affects the human lymphatic system and leads to longterm disability rather than death in sri lanka the disease is transmitted exclusively by the culex quinquefasciatus mosquito which breeds in polluted water the transmission dynamics depend on factors like the number of infected individuals microfilaria density and mosquito characteristics the parasite enters the human body through mosquito bites where it migrates to the lymphatic system and matures into adult worms these worms produce microfilariae that circulate in the bloodstream and can cause various clinical manifestations including chronic lymphedema elephantiasis hydrocele and occult filariasis characterized by respiratory symptoms control measures include personal protection using mosquito nets repellents and protective clothing breeding site elimination repairing septic tanks and cleaning drains community health initiatives screening for asymptomatic carriers and monitoring vector populations limitations include a lack of awareness about the disease and its transmission
nanotechnology is an emerging science involved in designing building and manipulating minute structures at the nanometer level a nanometer nm is one billionth of a meter 10 m nanotechnology is the creation and use of materials and devices on the same scale as molecules and intracellular structures typically less than 100 nm in size the physical and chemical properties of tiny molecules are significantly different than bigger particles as they have a very high surface area to volume ratio american physicist richard feynman in 1959 enlightened the world on nanotechnology living organisms are built of cells that are typically 10 um across however the subcellular organelles are much smaller proteins are even smaller with a typical size of just 5 nm which is comparable with the dimensions of smallest manmade nanoparticles this simple size comparison gives an idea of using nanoparticles as very small probes that would allow us to investigate the cellular machinery without introducing too much interference understanding of biological processes on the nanoscale level is a strong driving force behind development of nanotechnology nanotechnology has now become a big business with applications in material manufacturing energy electronics and engineering but applications of nanoparticles in biology and medicine are of particular interest one of the most important applications of nanotechnology is in medicine applications of nanotechnology for improving human health are termed nanomedicine nanotechnology can be applied for prevention diagnosis and treatment of diseases titanium dioxide tio and silver ag nanoparticles are used for sterilization of operation theatres and surgical instruments in hospitals these nanoparticles are able to destroy the microbes silver nano lotions are applied in theatres to prevent the entry of microbes nano particles are used in the production of antimicrobial coatings and nano filters tio and silver nano filters prevent the entrance of tiny particles such as viruses these nano filters are used to examine sars patients nano device sensors are used to monitor blood pressure blood oxygen levels and hormone concentrations nano particles can unclog blocked arteries and detect and eliminate cancer cells several nanotechnology enabled drugs are available in the market primarily in areas of cancer treatment scientists have developed smart drugs using tiny nanoparticles such as gold particles that are introduced into the body to seek out and target special cells such as cancer cells to deliver a cargo that would destroy those that are damaged rapidly and effectively in a silent manner with very few side effects pherical nanoparticles consisting of a dielectric core called nano shells are used in the treatment of cancer a nano shell is slightly bigger than a polio virus gold nano shells are used in bio imaging enhancements as well in the treatment of diabetes a nano device is attached to the body which can release the required dosage of insulin at required time intervals there has been successful application of nanotechnology to the treatment and management of pain both in clinical and experimental studies like the fabrication of nanoformulated liposomes to deliver drugs for pain therapy since nanocarrier systems can be easily transferred to the airways many respiratory diseases can be treated using nanotechnology viva gel is a vaginally applied microbicide in development for prevention of hiv and hsv herpes simplex virus viva gel is a product of nanotechnology which prevents the entry of hiv and hsv during sexual intercourse nonocomposites are used to replace broken bones and to fill teeth as well,nanotechnology is a rapidly developing field focused on the design and manipulation of materials at the nanoscale typically less than 100 nanometers nm in size this technology exploits the unique physical and chemical properties of nanoparticles which often have a high surface area to volume ratio the concept of nanotechnology was popularized by physicist richard feynman in 1959 and has significant applications in various industries especially in medicine referred to as nanomedicine key applications of nanotechnology in medicine include sterilization titanium dioxide tio and silver ag nanoparticles are used to sterilize surgical instruments and environments by destroying microbes diagnostics nanoparticles serve as effective sensors for monitoring vital signs such as blood pressure and oxygen levels targeted drug delivery smart drugs like gold nanoparticles target specific cells eg cancer cells for treatment with minimal side effects pain management nanoformulated liposomes are developed to deliver painrelieving drugs effectively disease prevention products like viva gel are being developed to prevent the transmission of viruses such as hiv overall nanotechnology offers innovative solutions for improving human health from diagnostics to targeted treatments
stem cells are undifferentiated cells which can give rise to cells of the same type they can divide by mitosis without a limit or at least for the lifetime of the animal they are capable of terminally differentiating into other cell types stem cells are required wherever there is a recurring need to replace differentiated cells that cannot themselves divide the stem cell itself has to be able to divide but it doesnt necessarily have to divide rapidly in fact stem cells usually divide at a relatively slow rate stem cells are of two types 1 embryonic stem cells 2 adult stem cells 1 embryonic stem cells following fertilization of a sperm and an egg cell the fertilized egg is called a zygote the zygote divides rapidly in humans in around five to seven days after fertilization the dividing cells create an embryo consisting of a small hollow cluster of approximately 100 cells called a blastocyst the blastocyst is approximately a seventh of a millimeter in diameter there is a small cluster of around 30 cells tucked inside the blastocyst that form a structure known as the inner cell mass these cells are the source of embryonic stem cells es cells s cells are so special because they can eventually differentiate to form all of the more than 200 cell types that make up the human body therefore es cells are called pluripotent because they have the potential to develop into a variety of different cell types human es cells hescs are unspecialized cells with two major properties e es cells can selfrenew indefinitely to produce more stem cells e under the proper growth conditions hescs can differentiate into a variety of mature cells with specialized functions 2 adult stem cells adult stem cells are found throughout the body after development adult stem cells are present in many tissues there are many types of adult stem cells specialized for the genesis of different classes of terminally differentiated cells and hence each type of stem cell serves for the renewal of one particular type of tissue eg epidermal stem cells for epidermis intestinal stem cells for intestinal epithelium hemopoietic stem cells for blood neural stem cells for central nervous system stem cells can be isolated and cultured in culture media in vitro when adult stem cells are removed from the body and maintained in culture or are transplanted from one site in the body to another they generally remain faithful to their origins this creates practical limitation of using adult stem cells for tissue regeneration in contract es cells can be kept proliferating indefinitely in culture and yet retain unrestricted developmental potential if es cells are put back into a blastocyst they become incorporated into the embryo and can give rise to all the tissues and cell types in the body including germ cells under the proper growth conditions human es cells can differentiate into a variety of mature cells with specialized functions in vitro there are ethical concerns of obtaining human embryonic stem cells therefore research on hesc is very controversial because of their source an early embryo in late 2006 scientists demonstrated the successful derivation of pluripotent stem cells from adult tissues by reprogramming human cells taken directly from a volunteer these are known as induced pluripotent stem cells ipscs pluripotent stem cells hold promise in the field of regenerative medicine because they can propagate indefinitely as well as give rise to every other cell type in the body such as neurons heart pancreatic and liver cells they represent a single source of cells that could be used to replace those lost to damage or disease since ipscs can be derived directly from adult tissues they not only bypass the need for embryos but can be made in a patientmatched manner which means that each individual could have their own pluripotent stem cell line applications of stem cells there are many potential applications of stem cells from growing healthy tissues to studying them to understand and treat birth defects to genetic manipulation for delivering genes in gene therapy approaches creating whole tissues in the laboratory using tissue engineering is another potential application for repairing tissues such as damaged heart muscles and damaged spinal neurons blood stem cells hemopoietic stem cells taken from the bone marrow of healthy immunologically compatible donor can be used to replenish bone marrow of patients with leukemia scientists believe that stem cell technologies will play key roles in developing treatments for diseases such as stroke heart disease parkinson disease alzheimer disease diabetes and many more,stem cells are undifferentiated cells that can divide indefinitely and differentiate into specialized cell types playing a vital role in tissue regeneration there are two main types of stem cells embryonic stem cells es cells derived from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst about five to seven days postfertilization pluripotent meaning they can differentiate into over 200 cell types in the human body and can selfrenew indefinitely ethical concerns arise from their source as obtaining them involves early embryos adult stem cells found in various tissues postdevelopment serving specific functions such as hemopoietic stem cells for blood or neural stem cells for the central nervous system while they can be isolated and cultured they typically maintain their original tissue identity limiting their versatility recent advancements have led to the development of induced pluripotent stem cells ipscs from adult tissues which mimic es cells without ethical issues applications of stem cells include tissue engineering to repair damaged organs treatments for conditions like stroke diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases gene therapy and studying disease mechanisms stem cell research holds promise for regenerative medicine and the treatment of various diseases
the human genome has been the focus of biological research for the last two decades and will continue to be the center of attention for many years to come it is a worldwide effort to identify all human genes of each chromosome along with several other goals the human genome project is an enormous undertaking in genomics that is providing scientists with exciting insight into human genes their locations and functions it was originally a 13 year project 19902003 coordinated by the us department of energy and the national institutes of health additional contributions came mainly from uk japan france germany australia and china the aims of the project were to 1 identify all the genes approximately 20000 protein coding genes in human genome 2determine the sequences of the 3 billion chemical base pairs that make up human dna 3store information in data bases 4improve tools for data analysis 5transfer related technologies to private sector 6address ethical legal and social issues that may arise from the project a major quality assessment of the human genome sequence was published in 2004 indicating over 92 of sampling exceeded 9999 accuracy which was within the intended goal the genome reference consortium grc which is an international collective of academic and research institutes with expertise in genome mapping is still working on the analyses of the data obtained from the human genome project he sequencing of the human genome holds benefits for many fields from molecular medicine to human evolution improved diagnosis of various diseases identification of mutations linked to different forms of cancer the design of medication and more accurate prediction of their effects gene therapy and control systems for drugs study of human evolution and anthropology are some of them another proposed benefit is the commercial development of genomics research related to dna based products a multibilliondollar industry the human genome project and the other genome projects such as escherichia coli yeast mouse arabidopsis thaliana and rice have already been completed this has therefore opened the way to a comprehensive description of the molecular activities of human cells and the ways in which these activities are controlled this is central to the continued development not only of molecular biology and genetics but also of those areas of biochemistry cell biology and physiology now described as the molecular life sciences the genome projects will have additional benefits that at present can only be guessed at it is evident that the human genome in common with the genomes of many other organisms contains extensive amounts of intergenic dna it was thought that most of the intergenic dna has no function except occasionally it is known that some intergenic dna acts to control genes nearby could the intergenic dna have a role but one that at present is too subtle for us to grasp though little is known about them they are thought to have regulatory functions the first step in addressing this possibility is to obtain a complete description of the organization of the intergenic dna in different genomes so that common features which might indicate a role for some or all of these sequences can be identified,the human genome project hgp was a landmark international research initiative that aimed to map all human genes and understand their functions running from 1990 to 2003 with contributions from various countries the projects key goals included identifying approximately 20000 proteincoding genes determining the sequences of the 3 billion base pairs in human dna storing the resulting information in databases for future analysis improving data analysis tools and addressing ethical legal and social issues a quality assessment in 2004 confirmed that over 92 of the genome sequencing exceeded 9999 accuracy the ongoing efforts of the genome reference consortium grc continue to refine this data the implications of the hgp extend beyond genetics they influence fields such as molecular medicine human evolution and drug design additionally the project has paved the way for advancements in other genome projects and the exploration of intergenic dna which may play critical yet currently unknown regulatory roles the commercial potential of genomics research also promises significant economic benefits

1 the study of life reveals common themes biology is a subject of enormous scope and exciting new biological discoveries are being made every day how can you organize into a comprehensible framework all the in formation youll encounter as you study the broad range of topics included in biology focusing on a few big ideas will help here well list five unifying themesways of thinking about life that will still hold true decades from now these unifying themes are described in greater detail in the next few pages we hope they will serve as touchstones as you proceed through this text organization information energy and matter interactions evolution the biosphere even from space we can see signs of earths lifein the green mosaic of the forests for example we can also see the scale of the entire biosphere which consists of all life on earth and all the places where life exists most regions of land most bodies of water the atmosphere to an altitude of several kilometers and even sediments far below the ocean floor ecosystems our first scale change brings us to a north american forest with many deciduous trees trees that lose their leaves and grow new ones each year a deciduous forest is an example of an ecosystem as are grasslands deserts and coral reefs an ecosystem consists of all the living things in a particular area along with all the nonliving components of the environment with which life interacts such as soil water atmospheric gases and light communities the array of organisms inhabiting a particular ecosystem is called a biological community the community in our forest ecosystem includes many kinds of trees and other plants various animals mushrooms and other fungi and enormous numbers of diverse microorganisms which are living forms such as bacteria that are too small to see without a microscope each of these forms of life is called a species,the study of biology encompasses vast topics that can be organized around five unifying themes organization information energy and matter interactions and evolution these themes provide a framework to understand life the biosphere includes all life on earth from the atmosphere to deep ocean sediments within the biosphere are ecosystems such as forests grasslands deserts and coral reefs which consist of both living organisms and nonliving elements like soil water and light an ecosystems biological community includes various species such as plants animals fungi and microorganisms interacting in complex ways each organism contributes to the ecosystems balance emphasizing the interconnectedness of life
populations a population consists of all the individuals of a species living within the bounds of a specified area for example our forest includes a population of sugar maple trees and a population of whitetailed deer a community is therefore the set of populations that inhabit a particular area organisms individual living things are called organisms each of the maple trees and other plants in the forest is an organism and so is each deer frog beetle and other forest animals the soil teems with microorganisms such as bacteria new properties emerge at successive levels of biological organization organization in figure 13 we zoom in from space to take a closer and closer look at life in a deciduous forest in ontario canada this journey shows the different levels of organization recognized by biologists the study of life extends from the global scale of the entire living planet to the micro scopic scale of cells and molecules the numbers in the figure guide you through the hierarchy of biological organization zooming in at everfiner resolution illustrates an ap proach called reductionism which reduces complex sys tems to simpler components that are more manageable to study reductionism is a powerful strategy in biology for example by studying the molecular structure of dna that had been extracted from cells james watson and francis crick inferred the chemical basis of biological inheritance however although it has propelled many major discoveries reductionism provides a necessarily incomplete view of life on earth as well discuss next organs and organ systems the structural hierarchy of life continues to unfold as we explore the architecture of more complex organisms a maple leaf is an example of an organ a body part that carries out a particular function in the body stems and roots are the other major organs of plants the organs of complex animals and plants are organized into organ systems each a team of organs that cooperate in a larger function organs consist of multiple tissues,a population consists of individuals of the same species in a specific area such as sugar maple trees or whitetailed deer in a forest a community includes all the populations of different species in that area organisms are individual living entities such as each maple tree deer or microorganism biological organization spans multiple levels from the entire planet biosphere down to microscopic cells and molecules the approach of reductionism breaking complex systems into simpler parts for easier study has led to major discoveries such as watson and cricks work on dna structure however organs and organ systems in both plants and animals show that life is made up of intricate interconnected systems where each organ like a maple leaf or a root serves a specific function
tissues viewing the tissues of a leaf requires a microscope each tissue is a group of cells that work together performing a specialized function the leaf shown here has been cut on an angle the honeycombed tissue in the interior of the leaf left side of photo is the main location of photosynthesis the process that converts light energy to the chemical energy of sugar the jigsaw puzzlelike skin on the surface of the leaf is a tissue called epidermis right side of photo the pores through the epidermis allow entry of the gas co2 a raw material for sugar production cells the cell is lifes fundamental unit of structure and function some organisms are single cells while others are multicellular a single cell performs all the functions of life while a multicellular organism has a division of labor among specialized cells here we see a magnified view of cells in a leaf tissue one cell is about 40 micrometers m across about 500 of them would reach across a small coin as tiny as these cells are you can see that each contains numerous green structures called chloroplasts which are responsible for photosynthesis molecules our last scale change drops us into a chloroplast for a view of life at the molecular level a molecule is a chemic structure consisting of two or more units called atoms represented as balls in this computer graphic of a chlorophyll molecule chlorophyll is the pigment molecule that makes a maple leaf green and it absorbs sunlight during photosynthesis within each chloroplast millions of chlorophyll molecules are organized into systems that convert light energy to the chemical energy of food,tissues are groups of cells that work together for specialized functions in a leaf tissues like the epidermis form the surface layer with pores allowing co entry essential for photosynthesis the process of converting light energy into chemical energy sugar cells the basic unit of life perform all life functions in multicellular organisms cells are specialized like chloroplasts in plant cells which conduct photosynthesis finally at the molecular level molecules like chlorophyll play a key role in absorbing sunlight converting light energy into food chlorophyll gives the leaf its green color and is organized into systems in the chloroplasts
emergent properties lets reexamine figure 13 beginning this time at the molecular level and then zooming out this approach allows us to see novel properties emerge at each level that are absent from the preceding level these emergent properties are due to the arrangement and interactions of parts as complexity increases for example although photosynthesis occurs in an intact chloroplast it will not take place in a disorganized testtube mixture of chlorophyll and other chloroplast molecules the coordinated processes of photo synthesis require a specific organization of these molecules in the chloroplast isolated components of living systems serving as the objects of study in a reductionist approach to biology lack a number of significant properties that emerge at higher levels of organization emergent properties are not unique to life a box of bi cycle parts wont transport you anywhere but if they are arranged in a certain way you can pedal to your chosen destination compared with such nonliving examples however biological systems are far more complex making the emergent properties of life especially challenging to study to explore emergent properties more fully biologists today complement reductionism with systems biology the exploration of a biological system by analyzing the interactions among its parts in this context a single leaf cell can be considered a system as can a frog an ant colony or a desert ecosystem by examining and modeling the dynamic behavior of an integrated network of components systems biology enables us to pose new kinds of questions for example we can ask how a drug that lowers blood pressure affects the functioning of organs throughout the human body at a larger scale how does a gradual increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide alter ecosystems and the entire biosphere systems biology can be used to study life at all levels structure and function at each level of the biological hierarchy we find a correlation of structure and function consider the leaf shown in figure 13 its thin flat shape maximizes the capture of sun light by chloroplasts more generally analyzing a biological structure gives us clues about what it does and how it works conversely knowing the function of something provides insight into its structure and organization many examples from the animal kingdom show a correlation between structure and function for example the hummingbirds anatomy allows the wings to rotate at the shoulder so hummingbirds have the ability unique among birds to fly backward or hover in place while hovering the birds can extend their long slender beaks into flowers and feed on nectar the elegant match of form and function in the structures of life is ex plained by natural selection which well explore shortly the cell an organisms basic unit of structure and function in lifes structural hierarchy the cell is the smallest unit of organization that can perform all activities required for life in fact the actions of organisms are all based on the func tioning of cells for instance the movement of your eyes as you read this sentence results from the activities of muscle and nerve cells even a process that occurs on a global scale such as the recycling of carbon atoms is the product of cellular functions including the photosynthetic activity of chloroplasts in leaf cells all cells share certain characteristics for instance every cell is enclosed by a membrane that regulates the passage of ma terials between the cell and its surroundings nevertheless we recognize two main forms of cells prokaryotic and eukaryotic the cells of two groups of singlecelled microorganisms bacteria singular bacterium and archaea singular archaeanare prokaryotic all other forms of life including plants and animals are composed of eukaryotic cells a eukaryotic cell contains membraneenclosed organ elles figure 14 some organelles such as the dna containing nucleus are found in the cells of all eukaryotes other organelles are specific to particular cell types for example the chloroplast in figure 13 is an organelle found only in eukaryotic cells that carry out photosynthesis in contrast to eukaryotic cells a prokaryotic cell lacks a nu cleus or other membraneenclosed organelles another dis tinction is that prokaryotic cells are generally smaller than eukaryotic cells as shown in figure 14,emergent properties refer to new characteristics that arise at each higher level of biological organization due to the interaction and arrangement of parts for example photosynthesis occurs only within an organized chloroplast not in a disorganized mixture of its components this highlights the need for proper arrangement for complex processes to occur systems biology is the study of such interactions within biological systems allowing scientists to analyze the dynamic relationships between components at all levels from cells to entire ecosystems the connection between structure and function is central to biology the shape of biological structures like the thin flat leaf that maximizes sunlight absorption is closely tied to their function similarly the hummingbirds wing structure allows it to hover and fly backward which is essential for feeding on flower nectar these adaptations are explained by natural selection at the cellular level the cell is the basic unit of life responsible for all vital functions organisms can be made up of either prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells prokaryotic cells like bacteria lack a nucleus while eukaryotic cells contain membranebound organelles such as chloroplasts which carry out photosynthesis in plants
lifes processes involve the expression and transmission of genetic information within cells structures called chromosomes contain genetic material in the form of dna deoxy ribonucleic acid in cells that are preparing to divide the chromosomes may be made visible using a dye that appears blue when bound to the dna figure 15 dna the genetic material each time a cell divides the dna is first replicated or copied and each of the two cellular offspring inherits a complete set of chromosomes identical to that of the parent cell each chromosome contains one very long dna molecule with hundreds or thousands of genes each a section of the dna of the chromosome transmitted from parents to off spring genes are the units of inheritance they encode the information necessary to build all of the molecules synthesized within a cell which in turn establish that cells identity and function each of us began as a single cell stocked with dna inherited from our parents the replication of that dna during each round of cell division transmitted copies of the dna to what eventually became the trillions of cells of our body as the cells grew and divided the genetic in formation encoded by the dna directed our development the molecular structure of dna accounts for its ability to store information a dna molecule is made up of two long chains called strands arranged in a double helix each chain is made up of four kinds of the molecular structure of dna accounts for its ability to store information a dna molecule is made up of two long chains called strands arranged in a double helix each chain is made up of four kinds of chemical building blocks called nucleotides abbreviated a t c and g a dna double helix this model shows the atoms in a segment of dna made up of two long chains strands of building blocks called nucleotides a dna molecule takes the threedimensional form of a double helix b single strand of dna these geometric shapes and letters are simple symbols for the nucleotides in a small section of one strand of a dna molecule genetic information is encoded in specific sequences of the four types of nucleotides their names are abbreviated a t c and g the way dna encodes information is analogous to how we arrange the letters of the alphabet into words and phrases with specific meanings the word rat for example evokes a rodent the words tar and art which contain the same letters mean very different things we can think of nucleotides as a fourletter alphabet specific sequences of these four nucleotides encode the information in genes many genes provide the blueprints for making proteins which are the major players in building and maintaining the cell and carrying out its activities for instance a given bacterial gene may specify a particular protein an enzyme required to break down a certain sugar molecule while a human gene may denote a different protein an antibody that helps fight off infection genes control protein production indirectly using a related molecule called rna as an intermediary figure 18 the sequence of nucleotides along a gene is transcribed into rna which is then translated into a linked series of protein building blocks called amino acids these two stages result in a specific protein with a unique shape and function the entire process by which the information in a gene directs the manufacture of a cellular product is called gene expression in translating genes into proteins all forms of life employ essentially the same genetic code a particular sequence of nucleotides says the same thing in one organism as it does in another differences between organisms reflect differences between their nucleotide sequences rather than between their genetic codes comparing the sequences in several species for a gene that codes for a particular protein can pro vide valuable information both about the protein and about the relationship of the species to each other as you will see in addition to rna molecules called mrnas that are translated into proteins some rnas in the cell carry out other important tasks for example we have known for de cades that some types of rna are actually components of the cellular machinery that manufactures proteins recently scientists have discovered whole new classes of rna that play other roles in the cell such as regulating the functioning of proteincoding genes all of these rnas are specified by genes and the production of these rnas is also referred to as gene expression by carrying the instructions for making proteins and rnas and by replicating with each cell division dna ensures faithful inheritance of genetic information from generation to generation genomics largescale analysis of dna sequences the entire library of genetic instructions that an organism inherits is called its genome a typical human cell has two similar sets of chromosomes and each set has approximately 3 billion nucleotide pairs of dna if the oneletter abbreviations for the nucleotides of a set were written in letters the size of those you are now reading the genetic text would fill about 700 biology textbooks since the early 1990s the pace at which researchers can determine the sequence of a genome has accelerated at an astounding rate enabled by a revolution in technology the entire sequence of nucleotides in the human genome is now known along with the genome sequences of many other organisms including other animals and numerous plants fungi bacteria and archaea to make sense of the deluge of data from genomesequencing projects and the growing catalog of known gene functions scientists are applying a systems biology approach at the cellular and molecular levels rather than investigating a single gene at a time researchers study whole sets of genes or other dna in one or more speciesan approach called genomics likewise the term proteomics refers to the study of sets of proteins and their properties the entire set of proteins expressed by a given cell or group of cells is called a proteome three important research developments have made the genomic and proteomic approaches possible one is highthroughput technology tools that can analyze many biological samples very rapidly the second major development is bioinformatics the use of computational tools to store organize and analyze the huge volume of data that results from highthroughput methods the third development is the formation of interdisciplinary research teamsgroups of diverse specialists that may include computer scientists mathematicians engineers chemists physicists and of course biologists from a variety of fields researchers in such teams aim to learn how the activities of all the proteins and nontranslated rnas encoded by the dna are coordinated in cells and in whole organisms theme life requires the transfer and transformation of energy and matter a fundamental characteristic of living organisms is their use of energy to carry out lifes activities moving growing reproducing and the various cellular activities of life are work and work requires energy the input of energy primarily from the sun and the transformation of energy from one form to another make life possible a plants leaves absorb sunlight and molecules within the leaves convert the energy of sunlight to the chemical energy of food such as sugars produced during photosynthesis the chemical energy in the food molecules is then passed along by plants and other photosynthetic organisms producers to consumers consumers are organisms such as animals that feed on producers and other consumers when an organism uses chemical energy to perform work such as muscle contraction or cell division some of that energy is lost to the surroundings as heat as a result energy flows one way through an ecosystem usually entering as light and exiting as heat in contrast chemicals are recycled within an ecosystem figure 19 chemicals that a plant absorbs from the air or soil may be incorporated into the plants body and then passed to an animal that eats the plant eventually these chemicals will be returned to the environment by decomposers such as bacteria and fungi that break down waste products leaf litter and the bodies of dead organisms the chemicals are then available to be taken up by plants again thereby completing the cycle,genetic information essential for life is stored in dna deoxyribonucleic acid within chromosomes in cells each chromosome contains a long dna molecule structured as a double helix composed of two strands made of nucleotides adenine a thymine t cytosine c and guanine g these nucleotides form genes the units of inheritance that encode instructions for building proteins crucial for cellular functions during cell division dna replicates ensuring each daughter cell inherits a complete set of chromosomes the process of gene expression involves two key stages transcription where dna is transcribed into messenger rna mrna and translation where mrna is decoded to assemble amino acids into proteins research has advanced into genomics the largescale analysis of genomes to study gene interactions and proteomics which focuses on the study of all proteins expressed in cells life requires energy transfer and transformation plants convert sunlight into chemical energy via photosynthesis this energy flows through ecosystems from producers plants to consumers animals while chemical elements are recycled between organisms and the environment ensuring continuity in life processes
theme from ecosystems to molecules interactions are important in biological systems i n t e r ac t i o n s at any level of the biological hierarchy interactions between the components of the system ensure smooth integration of all the parts such that they function as a whole this holds true equally well for the components of an ecosystem and the molecules in a cell well discuss both as examples ecosystems an organisms interactions with other organisms and the physical environment at the ecosystem level each organism interacts with other organisms for instance an acacia tree interacts with soil microorganisms associated with its roots insects that live on it and animals that eat its leaves and fruit figure 110 in some cases interactions between organisms are mutually beneficial an example is the association between a sea turtle and the socalled cleaner fish that hover around it the fish feed on parasites that would otherwise harm the turtle while gaining a meal and protection from predators sometimes one species benefits and the other is harmed as when a lion kills and eats a zebra in yet other cases both species are harmedfor example when two plants compete for a soil resource that is in short supply interactions among organisms help regulate the functioning of the ecosystem as a whole organisms also interact continuously with physical factors in their environment the leaves of a tree for example absorb light from the sun take in carbon dioxide from the air and release oxygen to the air see figure 110 the environment is also affected by the organisms living there for instance in addition to taking up water and minerals from the soil the roots of a plant break up rocks as they grow thereby contributing to the formation of soil on a global scale plants and other photosynthetic organisms have generated all the oxygen in the atmosphere molecules interactions within organisms at lower levels of organization the interactions between components that make up living organismsorgans tissues cells and moleculesare crucial to their smooth operation consider the sugar in your blood for instance after a meal the level of the sugar glucose in your blood rises figure 111 the increase in blood glucose stimulates the pancreas to re lease insulin into the blood once it reaches liver or muscle cells insulin causes excess glucose to be stored in the form of a very large carbohydrate called glycogen reducing blood glucose level to a range that is optimal for bodily functioning the lower blood glucose level that results no longer stimulates insulin secretion by pancreas cells some sugar is also used by cells for energy when you exercise your muscle cells increase their consumption of sugar molecules interactions among the bodys molecules are responsible for most of the steps in this process for instance like most chemical activities in the cell those that either decompose or store sugar are accelerated at the molecular level catalyzed by proteins called enzymes each type of enzyme catalyzes a specific chemical reaction in many cases these reactions are linked into chemical pathways each step with its own enzyme how does the cell coordinate its various chemical pathways in our example of sugar management how does the cell match fuel supply to demand regulating its opposing pathways of sugar consumption and storage the key is the ability of many biological processes to self regulate by a mechanism called feedback in feedback regulation the output or product of a process regulates that very process the most common form of regulation in living systems is negative feedback a loop in which the response reduces the initial stimulus as seen in the example of insulin signaling see figure 111 the uptake of glucose by cells the response decreases blood glucose levels eliminating the stimulus for insulin secretion and thereby shutting off the pathway thus the output of the process negatively regulates that process though less common than processes regulated by negative feedback there are also many biological processes regulated by positive feedback in which an end product speeds up its own production the clotting of your blood in response to injury is an example when a blood vessel is damaged structures in the blood called platelets begin to aggregate at the site positive feedback occurs as chemicals released by the platelets attract more platelets the platelet pileup then initiates a complex process that seals the wound with a clot feedback is a regulatory motif common to life at all levels from the molecular level through ecosystems and the biosphere interactions between organisms can affect systemwide processes like the growth of a population and as well see interactions between individuals not only affect evolution the core theme of biology that makes logical sense of everything we know about living organisms as we will see in units 4 and 5 of this text the fossil record documents the fact that life has been evolving on earth for billions of years resulting in a vast diversity of past and pres ent organisms but along with the diversity are many shared features for example while sea horses jackrabbits hum mingbirds and giraffes all look very different their skeletons are organized in the same basic way the scientific explana tion for this unity and diversityas well as for the adapta tion of organisms to their environmentsis evolution the concept that the organisms living on earth today are the modified descendants of common ancestors in other words we can explain the sharing of traits by two organisms with the premise that the organisms have descended from a com mon ancestor and we can account for differences with the idea that heritable changes have occurred along the way many kinds of evidence support the occurrence of evolution and the theory that describes how it takes place in the next section well consider the fundamental concept of evolution in greater detail,interactions are fundamental to biological systems ensuring that components work together effectively at both ecosystem and molecular levels in ecosystems organisms interact with each other and their environment creating complex relationships for instance acacia trees collaborate with soil microorganisms and animals forming mutualistic interactions such as the relationship between sea turtles and cleaner fish which benefits both parties conversely interactions can be detrimental such as predation or competition for resources impacting ecosystem dynamics at the molecular level interactions are crucial for organismal function for example when blood glucose levels rise after a meal the pancreas secretes insulin facilitating glucose storage as glycogen and maintaining optimal blood sugar levels this process involves enzymes that catalyze reactions within metabolic pathways highlighting the importance of feedback mechanisms in regulating these pathways negative feedback reduces initial stimuli while positive feedback as seen in blood clotting accelerates processes understanding these interactions and regulatory mechanisms provides insight into organismal function and evolution emphasizing the interconnectedness of life on earth
the core theme evolution accounts for the unity and diversity of life ev olution there is consensus among biologists that evolution is the core theme of biology the evolutionary changes seen in the fossil record are observable facts furthermore as well describe evolutionary mechanisms ac count for the unity and diversity of all species on earth to quote one of the founders of modern evolutionary theory theodosius dobzhansky nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution in addition to encompassing a hierarchy of size scales from molecules to the biosphere biology explores the great diversity of species that have ever lived on earth to understand dobzhanskys statement we need to discuss how biologists think about this vast diversity classifying the diversity of life diversity is a hallmark of life biologists have so far identified and named about 18 million species to date this diversity of life is known to include at least 100000 species of fungi 290000 plant species 57000 vertebrate species animals with backbones and 1 million insect species more than half of all known forms of lifenot to mention the myriad types of singlecelled organisms researchers identify thousands of additional species each year estimates of the total number of species range from about 10 million to over 100 million whatever the actual number the enormous variety of life gives biology a very broad scope biologists face a major challenge in attempting to make sense of this variety grouping species the basic idea there is a human tendency to group diverse items according to their similarities and their relationships to each other for instance we may speak of squirrels and butterflies though we recognize that many different species belong to each group we may even sort groups into broader categories such as rodents which include squirrels and insects which include butterflies taxonomy the branch of biology that names and classifies species formalizes this ordering of species into groups of increasing breadth based on the degree to which they share characteristics figure 112 you will learn more about the details of this taxonomic scheme in chapter 26 here we will focus on the big picture by considering the broadest units of classification kingdoms and domains the three domains of life historically scientists have classified the diversity of lifeforms into species and broader groupings by careful comparisons of structure function and other obvious features in the last few decades new methods of assessing species relationships such as comparisons of dna sequences have led to an ongoing reevaluation of the number and boundaries of kingdoms researchers have proposed anywhere from six kingdoms to dozens of kingdoms while debate continues at the kingdom level biologists agree that the kingdoms of life can be grouped into three even higher levels of classification called domains the three domains are named bacteria archaea and eukarya figure 113 as you read earlier the organisms making up two of the three domainsbacteria and archaeaare prokaryotic all the eukaryotes organisms with eukaryotic cells are now grouped in domain eukarya this domain includes three kingdoms of multicellular eukaryotes kingdoms plantae fungi and animalia these three kingdoms are distinguished partly by their modes of nutrition plants produce their own sugars and other food molecules by photosynthesis fungi absorb dissolved nutrients from their surroundings and animals obtain food by eating and digesting other organisms animalia is of course the kingdom to which we belong but neither plants nor fungi nor animals are as numerous or diverse as the singlecelled eukaryotes we call protists although protists were once placed in a single kingdom recent evidence shows that some protists are more closely related to plants animals or fungi than they are to other protists thus the recent taxonomic trend has been to split the protists into several kingdoms a domain bacteria bacteria are the most diverse and widespread prokaryotes and are now classified into multiple kingdoms each rodshaped structure in this photo is a bacterial cell b domain archaea some of the prokaryotes known as archaea live in earths extreme environments such as salty lakes and boiling hot springs domain archaea includes multiple kingdoms each round structure in this photo is an archaeal cell c domain eukarya kingdom plantae consists of terrestrial multicellular eukaryotes land plants that carry out photosynthesis the conversion of light energy to the chemical energy in food kingdom fungi is defined in part by the nutritional mode of its members such as this mushroom which absorb nutrients from outside their bodies kingdom animalia consists of multicellular eukaryotes that ingest other organisms protists are mostly unicellular eukaryotes and some relatively simple multicellular relatives pictured here is an assortment of protists inhabiting pond water scientists are currently debating how to classify protists in a way that accurately reflects their evolutionary relationships,evolution is widely recognized as the central theme in biology providing a framework for understanding the unity and diversity of life on earth theodosius dobzhansky famously stated nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution emphasizing that evolutionary changes observed in the fossil record are factual and reveal the interconnectedness of species biologists have identified approximately 18 million species encompassing a vast range of life forms including fungi plants vertebrates and insects with estimates of total species numbers potentially exceeding 100 million this diversity poses a significant challenge for biologists who strive to categorize and understand the variety of life taxonomy the science of naming and classifying organisms helps group species based on shared characteristics recent advances in genetic analysis have led to a reevaluation of lifes classification consolidating all species into three primary domains bacteria archaea and eukarya each domain encompasses multiple kingdoms with eukarya including the kingdoms of plantae fungi and animalia distinguished by their modes of nutrition protists primarily unicellular eukaryotes complicate classification due to their diverse evolutionary relationships
charles darwin and the theory of natural selection the history of life as documented by fossils and other evidence is the saga of a changing earth billions of years old inhabited by an evolving cast of living forms figure 115 this evolutionary view of life came into sharp focus in november 1859 when charles robert darwin published one of the most important and influential books ever written entitled on the origin of species by means of natural selection darwins book was an immediate bestseller and soon made darwinism as it was dubbed at the time almost syn onymous with the concept of evolution figure 116 on the origin of species articulated two main points the first point was that contemporary species arose from a succession of ancestors that differed from them darwin called this process descent with modification this insightful phrase captured the duality of lifes unity and diversityunity in the kinship among species that descended from common ancestors and diversity in the modifications that evolved as species branched from their common ancestors darwins second main point was his proposal that natural selection is an evolutionary mechanism for descent with modification darwin developed his theory of natural selection from observations that by themselves were neither new nor pro found others had described the pieces of the puzzle but darwin saw how they fit together he started with the fol lowing three observations from nature first individuals in a population vary in their traits many of which seem to be heritable passed on from parents to offspring second a population can produce far more offspring than can survive to produce offspring of their own with more individuals than the environment is able to support competition is inevitable third species generally suit their environments in other words they are adapted to their environments for instance a common adaptation among birds that eat tough seeds as their major food source is that they have especially thick strong beaks making inferences from these three observations dar win arrived at his theory of evolution he reasoned that individuals with inherited traits that are better suited to the local environment are more likely to survive and reproduce than less wellsuited individuals over many generations a higher and higher proportion of individuals in a population will have the advantageous traits evolution occurs as the unequal reproductive success of individuals ultimately leads to adaptation to their environment as long as the environment remains the same darwin called this mechanism of evolutionary adaptation natural selection because the natural environment selects for the propagation of certain traits among naturally occurring variant traits in the population the example in figure 118 illustrates the ability of natural selection to edit a populations heritable variations in color we see the products of natural selection in the exquisite adaptations of various organisms to the special circumstances of their way of life and their environment the wings of the bat shown in figure 119 are an excellent example of adaptation,charles darwins influential work on the origin of species by means of natural selection published in november 1859 articulated two key points about evolution descent with modification contemporary species arise from a succession of ancestors highlighting the unity common ancestry and diversity modifications of life forms natural selection this is the mechanism by which evolution occurs darwin based his theory on three observations variation individuals in a population vary in traits that are often heritable overproduction more offspring are produced than can survive leading to competition for resources adaptation species generally adapt to their environments darwin reasoned that individuals with traits better suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce over generations advantageous traits become more common in the population natural selection thus acts on heritable variations driving evolutionary change and adaptation in response to environmental conditions
the tree of life take another look at the skeletal architecture of the bats wings in figure 119 these wings are not like those of feathered birds the bat is a mammal the bats forelimbs though adapted for flight actually have all the same bones joints nerves and blood vessels found in other limbs as diverse as the human arm the foreleg of a horse and the flipper of a whale indeed all mammalian forelimbs are anatomical variations of a common architecture much as the birds in figure 117 are variations on an underlying avian theme such examples of kinship connect lifes unity in diversity to the darwinian concept of descent with modification in this view the unity of mammalian limb anatomy reflects inheritance of that structure from a common ancestorthe prototype mammal from which all other mammals descended the diversity of mammalian fore limbs results from modification by natural selection operating over millions of generations in different environmental contexts fossils and other evidence corroborate anatomical unity in supporting this view of mammalian descent from a common ancestor darwin proposed that natural selection by its cumulative effects over long periods of time could cause an ancestral species to give rise to two or more descendant species this could occur for example if one population fragmented into several subpopulations isolated in different environments in these separate arenas of natural selection one species could gradually radiate into multiple species as the geographically isolated populations adapted over many generations to different sets of environmental factors the family tree of 14 finches in figure 120 illustrates a famous example of adaptive radiation of new species from a common ancestor darwin collected specimens of these birds during his 1835 visit to the remote galpagos islands 900 kilometers km off the pacific coast of south america these relatively young volcanic islands are home to many species of plants and animals found nowhere else in the world though many galpagos organisms are clearly related to species on the south american mainland after volcanoes built up the galpagos several million years ago finches probably diversified on the various islands from an ancestral finch species that by chance reached the archipelago from elsewhere years after darwin collected the galapagos finches researchers began to sort out the relationships among these finch species first from anatomical and geo graphic data and more recently with the help of dna sequence comparisons biologists diagrams of evolutionary relationships generally take treelike forms though the trees are often turned sideways as in figure 120 tree diagrams make sense just as an individual has a genealogy that can be diagrammed as a family tree each species is one twig of a branching tree of life extending back in time through ancestral species more and more remote species that are very similar such as the galpagos finches share a common ancestor at a relatively recent branch point on the tree of life but through an ancestor that lived much farther back in time finches are related to sparrows hawks penguins and all other birds and birds mammals and all other vertebrates share a common ancestor even more ancient trace life back far enough and we reach the early prokaryotes that inhabited earth over 35 billion years ago we can recognize their vestiges in our own cellsin the universal genetic code for example indeed all of life is connected through its long evolutionary history,the skeletal structure of bat wings illustrates the concept of homology where diverse species share anatomical features inherited from a common ancestor although bat wings like those of birds are adapted for flight they contain the same basic bones found in mammalian limbs highlighting the unity and diversity of life through descent with modification darwin proposed that natural selection can lead to the emergence of multiple descendant species from a common ancestor particularly when populations become isolated in different environments leading to adaptive radiation an example of this is seen in the finches of the galpagos islands which evolved from a single ancestral species into various forms adapted to different ecological niches this branching tree of life reflects the evolutionary relationships among species showing that all life is connected through a long evolutionary history dating back over 35 billion years to early prokaryotic organisms
in studying nature scientists make observations and form and test hypotheses science is a way of knowingan approach to understanding the natural world it developed out of our curiosity about ourselves other lifeforms our planet and the universe the word science is derived from a latin verb meaning to know striving to understand seems to be one of our basic urges at the heart of science is inquiry a search for information and explanations of natural phenomena there is no formula for successful scientific inquiry no single scientific method that researchers must rigidly follow as in all quests science includes elements of challenge adventure and luck along with careful planning reasoning creativity patience and the persistence to overcome setbacks such diverse elements of inquiry make science far less structured than most people realize that said it is possible to highlight certain characteristics that help to distinguish science from other ways of describing and explaining nature scientists use a process of inquiry that includes making observations forming logical testable explanations hypotheses and testing them the process is necessarily repetitive in testing a hypothesis more observations may inspire revision of the original hypothesis or formation of a new one thus leading to further testing in this way scientists circle closer and closer to their best estimation of the laws governing nature making observations in the course of their work scientists describe natural structures and processes as accurately as possible through careful observation and analysis of data observation is the gathering of information either through direct use of the senses or with the help of tools such as microscopes thermometers and balances that extend our senses observations can reveal valuable information about the natural world for example a series of detailed observations have shaped our understanding of cell structure and another set of observations is currently expanding our databases of genomes of diverse species and of genes whose expression is altered in cancer and other diseases recorded observations are called data put another way data are items of information on which scientific inquiry is based the term data implies numbers to many people but some data are qualitative often in the form of recorded descriptions rather than numerical measurements for example jane goodall spent decades recording her observations of chimpanzee behavior during field research in a tanzanian jungle figure 121 along with these qualitative data goodall also enriched the field of animal behavior with volumes of quantitative data such as the frequency and du ration of specific behaviors for different members of a group of chimpanzees in a variety of situations quantitative data are generally expressed as numerical measurements and often organized into tables and graphs scientists analyze their data using a type of mathematics called statistics to test whether their results are significant or merely due to random fluctuations note that all results presented in this text have been shown to be statistically significant collecting and analyzing observations can lead to important conclusions based on a type of logic called inductive reasoning through induction we derive generalizations from a large number of specific observations the sun always rises in the east is an example and so is all organ isms are made of cells careful observations and data analyses along with generalizations reached by induction are fundamental to our understanding of nature forming and testing hypotheses our innate curiosity often stimulates us to pose questions about the natural basis for the phenomena we observe in the world what caused the different chimpanzee behaviors that goodall observed in different situations what causes the roots of a plant seedling to grow downward in science such inquiry usually involves the forming and testing of hypo thetical explanationsthat is hypotheses in science a hypothesis is a tentative answer to a well framed questionan explanation on trial it is usually a rational account for a set of observations based on the avail able data and guided by inductive reasoning a scientific hypothesis must lead to predictions that can be tested by making additional observations or by performing experiments an experiment is a scientific test carried out under controlled conditions we all use observations and develop questions and hypotheses in solving everyday problems lets say for example that your flashlight fails while you are camping thats an observation the question is obvious why doesnt the flashlight work two reasonable hypotheses based on your experience are that 1 the batteries in the flashlight are dead or 2 the bulb is burnt out each of these alternative hypotheses leads to predictions you can test with informal experiments for example the deadbattery hypothesis predicts that replacing the batteries will fix the problem figure 122 diagrams this campground inquiry figuring things out like this by systematic trial and error is a hypothesisbased approach sometimes we cant carry out an experiment but can test a hypothesis using observations lets say you dont have a spare bulb or spare batteries how could you figure out which hypothesis is more likely you could examine the bulb and see if it looks burnt out you could also check the expiration date on the battery experiments are great ways to test hypotheses but when experiments arent possible we can often test a hypothesis in other ways,science is a systematic approach to understanding the natural world rooted in curiosity about life and the universe it involves a process of inquiry which includes making observations forming hypotheses and testing those hypotheses through experiments or further observations observations can be qualitative or quantitative leading to data that inform scientific understanding for example jane goodalls studies of chimpanzee behavior combined qualitative descriptions with quantitative measurements to provide a comprehensive view of animal behavior hypotheses serve as tentative explanations for observed phenomena and must be testable the scientific method is iterative allowing for the revision of hypotheses based on new data for instance if a flashlight fails one might hypothesize about dead batteries or a burntout bulb and test these through experimentation or observation this structured approach to inquiry distinguishes science from other ways of knowing
deductive reasoning a type of logic called deduction is also built into the use of hypotheses in science while induction entails reasoning from a set of specific observations to reach a general conclusion deductive reasoning involves logic that flows in the opposite direction from the general to the specific from general premises we extrapolate to the specific results we should expect if the premises are true in the scientific process deductions usually take the form of predictions of results that will be found if a particular hypothesis premise is correct we then test the hypothesis by carrying out experiments or observations to see whether or not the results are as predicted this deductive testing takes the form of if then logic in the case of the flashlight example if the deadbattery hypothesis is correct then the flashlight should work if you replace the batteries with new ones the flashlight inquiry demonstrates two other key points about the use of hypotheses in science first the initial observations may give rise to multiple hypotheses the ideal plan is to design experiments to test all these candidate explanations for instance another of the many possible alter native hypotheses to explain our dead flashlight is that both the batteries and the bulb are bad and you could design an experiment to test this second we can never prove that a hypothesis is true based on the experiments shown in figure 122 the burntout bulb hypothesis stands out as the most likely explanation the results support that hypothesis but do not absolutely prove it is correct perhaps the first bulb was simply loose so it wasnt making electrical contact and the new bulb was inserted correctly we could attempt to test the burntout bulb hypothesis again by trying another experimentremoving the original bulb and carefully reinstalling it if the flashlight still doesnt work the burntout bulb hypothesis is supported by another line of evidencebut still not proven for example the bulb may have another defect not related to being burnt out testing a hypothesis in various ways producing different sorts of data can increase our confidence in it tremendously but no amount of experimental testing can prove a hypothesis beyond a shadow of doubt questions that can and cannot be addressed by science scientific inquiry is a powerful way to learn about nature but there are limitations to the kinds of questions it can answer a scientific hypothesis must be testable there must be some observation or experiment that could reveal if such an idea is likely to be true or false the hypothesis that dead batteries are the sole cause of the broken flashlight could be and was tested by replacing the old batteries with new ones not all hypotheses meet the criteria of science you wouldnt be able to test the hypothesis that invisible camp ground ghosts are fooling with your flashlight because science only deals with natural testable explanations for natural phenomena it can neither support nor contradict the invisible ghost hypothesis nor whether spirits elves or fairies either benevolent or evil cause storms rainbows ill nesses and cures such supernatural explanations because they cannot be tested are simply outside the bounds of science for the same reason science does not deal with religious matters which are issues of personal faith science and religion are not mutually exclusive or contradictory they are simply concerned with different issues the flexibility of the scientific process the flashlight example of figure 122 traces an idealized process of inquiry sometimes called the scientific method we can recognize the elements of this process in most of the research articles published by scientists but rarely in such structured form very few scientific inquiries adhere rigidly to the sequence of steps prescribed by the textbook scientific method which is often applied in hindsight after the experiment or study is completed for example a scientist may start to design an experiment but then backtrack after realizing that more preliminary observations are necessary in other cases puzzling observations simply dont prompt welldefined questions until other research places those observations in a new context for example darwin collected specimens of the galpagos finches but it wasnt until years later as the idea of natural selection began to gel that biologists began asking key questions about the history of those birds science is a lot more unpredictableand excitingthan lockstep adherence to any fivestep method a more realistic model of the scientific process is shown in figure 123 the core activity the central circle in the figure is the forming and testing of hypotheses this is the most fundamental aspect of science and is the reason that science does such a reliable job of explaining phenomena in the natural world however there is much more to the scientific process than just testing the choice of ideas to test the interpretation and evaluation of results and the decision about which ideas to pursue for further study are influenced by three other arenas as well first wellframed questions new hypotheses and good study designs do not spring to life out of thin air they are inspired and nurtured by the sorts of endeavors associated with exploration and discovery the upper circle in figure 123 second testing is not performed in a social vacuum community analysis and feedback play an important role lower right circle interactions within the scientific com munity influence which hypotheses are tested and how provoke reinterpretations of test results provide independent assessments of the validity of study designs and much more finally the process of science is interwoven with the fabric of society lower left circle a societal needfor ex ample to understand the process of climate changemay inspire a flurry of hypotheses and studies similarly well supported hypotheses may wind up enabling an important technological innovation or encouraging a particular policy which may in turn inspire new scientific questions though testing hypotheses and interpreting data are at the heart of science these pursuits represent only part of the picture,deductive reasoning is a logical process in science that moves from general premises to specific predictions in this context scientists use deductive reasoning to formulate testable predictions based on their hypotheses for example if a hypothesis states that dead batteries are the reason a flashlight doesnt work then replacing the batteries should resolve the issue while testing a hypothesis multiple hypotheses may arise and it is crucial to design experiments to test each one however no hypothesis can be definitively proven true evidence can only support or strengthen it science is limited to testable questions about the natural world and it does not address supernatural claims or religious beliefs the scientific process is flexible and often deviates from the idealized scientific method adapting to new discoveries and social influences a more realistic view includes forming and testing hypotheses inspired by exploration community feedback and societal needs
a case study in scientific inquiry investigating coat coloration in mouse populations now that we have highlighted the key features of scientific inquirymaking observations and forming and testing hypothesesyou should be able to recognize these features in a case study of actual scientific research the story begins with a set of observations and inductive generalizations color patterns of animals vary widely in nature sometimes even among members of the same species what accounts for such variation an illustrative example is found in two populations of mice that belong to the same species peromyscus polionotus but have different color patterns and reside in different environments figure 124 the beach mouse lives along the florida seashore a habitat of brilliant white sand dunes with sparse clumps of beach grass the inland mouse lives on darker more fertile soil farther inland even a brief glance at the photographs in figure 124 reveals a striking match of mouse coloration to its habitat the natural predators of these mice including hawks owls foxes and coyotes are all visual hunters they use their eyes to look for prey it was logical therefore for francis bertody sumner a naturalist studying populations of these mice in the 1920s to form the hypothesis that their coloration patterns had evolved as adaptations that camouflage the mice in their native environments protecting them from predation as obvious as the camouflage hypothesis may seem it still required testing in 2010 biologist hopi hoekstra of harvard university and a group of her students headed to florida to test the prediction that mice with coloration that did not match their habitat would be preyed on more heavily than the native wellmatched mice figure 125 summarizes this field experiment the researchers built hundreds of plasticine models of mice and spray painted them to resemble either beach mice light colored or inland mice darker colored so that the models differed only in their color patterns the researchers placed equal numbers of these model mice randomly in both habitats and left them overnight the mouse models resembling the native mice in the habitat were the control group for instance lightcolored beach mouse models in the beach habitat while the mouse models with the non native coloration were the experimental group the following morning the team counted and re corded signs of predation events which ranged from bites and gouge marks on some models to the outright disappearance of others judging by the shape of the predators bites and the tracks surrounding the experimental sites the predators appeared to be split fairly evenly between mammals such as foxes and coyotes and birds such as owls herons and hawks for each environment the researchers then calculated the percentage of predation events that targeted camouflaged mouse models the results were clear camouflaged models experienced much less predation than those lacking camouflage in both the beach habitat where light mice were less vulnerable and the inland habitat where dark mice were less vulnerable the data thus fit the key prediction of the camouflage hypothesis for more information about hopi hoekstra and her research with beach mice see the interview before chapter 22 experimental variables and controls earlier in this section we described an experiment as a scientific test carried out under controlled conditions more specifically an experiment involves manipulation of one factor in a system in order to see the effects of changing it both the factor that is manipulated and the effects that are measured are types of experimental variablesfactors that vary in an experiment the mouse camouflage experiment described in figure 125 is an example of a controlled experiment one that is designed to compare an experimental group the noncamouflaged mice in this case with a control group the camouflaged mice normally resident in the area ide ally the experimental and control groups are designed to differ only in the one factor the experiment is testingin our example the effect of mouse coloration on the behavior of predators here mouse color is the factor manipulated by the researchers it is called the independent variable the amount of predation is the dependent variable a fac tor that is measured in the experiment without the control group the researchers would not have been able to rule out other factors as causes of the more frequent attacks on the noncamouflaged micesuch as different numbers of predators or different temperatures in the different test areas the clever experimental design left coloration as the only factor that could account for the low predation rate on the camouflaged mice placed in their normal environment a common misconception is that the term controlled experiment means that scientists control the experimental environment to keep everything strictly constant except the one variable being tested but thats impossible in field research and not realistic even in highly regulated laboratory environments researchers usually control unwanted variables not by eliminating them through environmental regulation but by canceling out their effects by using control groups theories in science our everyday use of the term theory often implies an un tested speculation its just a theory but the term theory has a different meaning in science what is a scientific theory and how is it different from a hypothesis or from mere speculation first a scientific theory is much broader in scope than a hypothesis this is a hypothesis fur coloration well matched to their habitat is an adaptation that protects mice from predators but this is a theory evolutionary adaptations arise by natural selection this theory proposes that natural selection is the evolutionary mechanism that ac counts for an enormous variety of adaptations of which coat color in mice is but one example second a theory is general enough to spin off many new specific hypotheses that can be tested for example two researchers at princeton university peter and rosemary grant were motivated by the theory of natural selection to test the specific hypothesis that the beaks of galpagos finches evolve in response to changes in the types of avail able food their results supported their hypothesis see the chapter 23 overview and third compared with any hypothesis a theory is generally supported by a much greater body of evidence the theory of natural selection has been supported by a vast quantity of evidence with more being found every day and has not been contradicted by any scientific data other similarly supported theories include the theory of gravity and the theory that the earth revolves around the sun those theories that become widely adopted in science explain a great range of observations and are supported by a vast accumulation of evidence in fact scrutiny of theories continues through testing of the specific hypotheses they generate in spite of the body of evidence supporting a widely accepted theory scientists will modify or even reject theories when new research produces results that dont fit for ex ample the theory of biological diversity that lumped bacteria and archaea together as a kingdom of prokaryotes began to erode when new methods for comparing cells and molecules made it possible to test some of the hypothetical relationships between organisms that were based on the theory if there is truth in science it is at best conditional based on the preponderance of available evidence,this case study examines coat coloration in two populations of mice peromyscus polionotus to investigate how color patterns adapt for camouflage against predators the beach mouse with light coloration inhabits sandy areas while the inland mouse darker in color lives in fertile soil naturalist francis bertody sumner hypothesized that these colorations evolved to protect the mice from predation to test this hypothesis biologist hopi hoekstra and her team used plasticine models resembling the mice placing them in both habitats to observe predation rates they found that models matching the local coloration experienced significantly less predation supporting the camouflage hypothesis this experiment highlighted the importance of controlled variables where the mouse color was the independent variable affecting the dependent variable of predation rates the study exemplifies scientific inquiry and demonstrates that a scientific theory like natural selection provides a broad framework for generating testable hypotheses based on extensive evidence
science benefits from a cooperative approach and diverse viewpoints movies and cartoons sometimes portray scientists as loners working in isolated labs in reality science is an in tensely social activity most scientists work in teams which often include both graduate and undergraduate students and to succeed in science it helps to be a good communicator research results have no impact until shared with a community of peers through seminars publications and websites building on the work of others the great scientist isaac newton once said to explain all nature is too difficult a task for any one man or even for any one age tis much better to do a little with certainty and leave the rest for others that come after you anyone who becomes a scientist driven by curiosity about how nature works is sure to benefit greatly from the rich store house of discoveries by others who have come before in fact hopi hoekstras experiment benefited from the work of another researcher d w kaufman 40 years earlier you can study the design of kaufmans experiment and interpret the results in the scientific skills exercise scientific results are continually vetted through the repetition of observations and experiments scientists working in the same research field often check one anothers claims by attempting to confirm observations or repeat experiments if experimental results cannot be repeated by scientific colleagues this failure may reflect some underlying weakness in the original claim which will then have to be revised in this sense science polices itself integrity and adherence to high professional standards in reporting results are central to the scientific endeavor after all the validity of experimental data is key to designing further lines of inquiry it is not unusual for several scientists to converge on the same research question some scientists enjoy the challenge of being first with an important discovery or key experiment while others derive more satisfaction from cooperating with fellow scientists working on the same problem cooperation is facilitated when scientists use the same organism often it is a widely used model organisma species that is easy to grow in the lab and lends itself particularly well to the questions being investigated because all species are evolutionarily related such an organism may be viewed as a model for understanding the biology of other species and their diseases for example genetic studies of the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster have taught us a lot about how genes work in other species even humans some other popular model organisms are the mustard plant arabidopsis thaliana the soil worm caenorhabditis elegans the zebrafish danio rerio the mouse mus musculus and the bacterium escherichia coli as you read through this book note the many contributions that these and other model organisms have made to the study of life biologists may approach interesting questions from different angles some biologists focus on ecosystems while others study natural phenomena at the level of organisms or cells this text is divided into units that look at biology at different levels yet any given problem can be addressed from many perspectives which in fact complement each other for example hoekstras work uncovered at least one genetic mutation that underlies the differences between beach and inland mouse coloration her lab includes biologists specializing at different biological levels allowing links to be made between the evolutionary adaptations she focuses on and their molecular basis in dna sequences as a biology student you can benefit from making connections between the different levels of biology you can develop this skill by noticing when certain topics crop up again and again in different units one such topic is sicklecell disease a wellunderstood genetic condition that is prevalent among native inhabitants of africa and other warm regions and their descendants sicklecell disease will appear in several units of the text each time addressed at a new level in addition we have designed a number of figures that make connections between the content in different chapters as well as questions that ask you to make the connections yourselves we hope these features will help you integrate the material youre learning and enhance your enjoyment of biology by encouraging you to keep the big picture in mind science technology and society the research community is part of society at large and the relationship of science to society becomes clearer when we add technology to the picture see figure 123 though science and technology sometimes employ similar inquiry patterns their basic goals differ the goal of science is to understand natural phenomena while that of technology is to apply scientific knowledge for some specific purpose biologists and other scientists usually speak of discoveries while engineers and other technologists more often speak of inventions because scientists put new technology to work in their research science and technology are interdependent the potent combination of science and technology can have dramatic effects on society sometimes the applications of basic research that turn out to be the most beneficial come out of the blue from completely unanticipated observations in the course of scientific exploration for example discovery of the structure of dna by watson and crick 60 years ago and subsequent achievements in dna science led to the technologies of dna manipulation that are transforming applied fields such as medicine agriculture and forensics figure 126 perhaps watson and crick envisioned that their discovery would someday lead to important applications but it is unlikely that they could have predicted exactly what all those applications would be the directions that technology takes depend less on the curiosity that drives basic science than on the current needs and wants of people and on the social environment of the times debates about technology center more on should we do it than can we do it with advances in technology come difficult choices for example under what circumstances is it acceptable to use dna technology to find out if particular people have genes for hereditary diseases should such tests always be voluntary or are there circumstances when genetic testing should be mandatory should insurance companies or employers have access to the information as they do for many other types of personal health data these questions are becoming much more urgent as the sequencing of individual genomes becomes quicker and cheaper ethical issues raised by such questions have as much to do with politics economics and cultural values as with science and technology all citizensnot only professional scientistshave a responsibility to be informed about how science works and about the potential benefits and risks of technology the relationship between science technology and society increases the significance and value of any biology course,science is fundamentally a collaborative and social endeavor where scientists work in teams and communicate findings to advance knowledge the process of scientific inquiry builds on the discoveries of others with new experiments often stemming from previous research this interconnectedness is evident in the use of model organisms like drosophila melanogaster and mus musculus which facilitate research across various biological levels different perspectives within biology complement one another as seen in studies like those of hopi hoekstra who explored genetic mutations influencing mouse coloration moreover the interplay between science and technology shapes societal advancements with scientific discoveries often leading to unforeseen applications while science seeks to understand natural phenomena technology applies this knowledge for specific purposes ethical dilemmas arise as technology advances particularly in areas like genetic testing highlighting the need for public awareness and discourse on the implications of scientific advancements
the value of diverse viewpoints in science many of the technological innovations with the most profound impact on human society originated in settlements along trade routes where a rich mix of different cultures ignited new ideas for example the printing press which helped spread knowledge to all social classes and ultimately led to the book in your hands was invented by the german johannes gutenberg around 1440 this invention relied on several innovations from china including paper and ink paper traveled along trade routes from china to baghdad where technology was developed for its mass production this technology then migrated to europe as did waterbased ink from china which was modified by gutenberg to become oilbased ink we have the crossfertilization of diverse cultures to thank for the printing press and the same can be said for other important inventions along similar lines science stands to gain much from embracing a diversity of backgrounds and viewpoints among its practitioners but just how diverse a population are scientists in relation to gender race ethnicity and other attributes the scientific community reflects the cultural standards and behaviors of the society around it it is therefore not surprising that until recently women and certain minorities have faced huge obstacles in their pursuit to become professional scientists in many countries around the world over the past 50 years changing attitudes about career choices have increased the proportion of women in biology and some other sciences so that now women constitute roughly half of undergraduate biology majors and biology phd students the pace has been slow at higher levels in the profession however and women and many racial and ethnic groups are still significantly underrepresented in many branches of science this lack of diversity hampers the progress of science the more voices that are heard at the table the more robust valuable and productive the scientific interchange will be the authors of this text welcome all students to the community of biologists wishing you the joys and satisfactions of this exciting field of science,diverse viewpoints and backgrounds in science are crucial for innovation and progress many significant technological advancements such as the printing press invented by johannes gutenberg in the 15th century emerged from the collaboration of various cultures along trade routes this illustrates how crosscultural exchanges can lead to transformative ideas however the scientific community has historically reflected societal biases resulting in underrepresentation of women and minorities in many scientific fields although the proportion of women in biology has increased to nearly half of undergraduate majors and phd students disparities remain at higher professional levels this lack of diversity limits scientific advancement as a wider range of perspectives can enhance creativity and productivity in research embracing diversity within the scientific community is essential for fostering a more robust and effective exchange of ideas
a chemical connection to biology like other animals ants have structures and mechanisms that defend them from attack wood ants live in colonies of hundreds or thousands and the colony as a whole has a particularly effective mechanism for dealing with enemies when threatened the ants shoot volleys of formic acid into the air from their abdomens and the acid rains down upon the potential invaders figure 21 this substance is produced by many species of ants and in fact got its name from the latin word for antformica for quite a few ant species the formic acid isnt shot out but probably serves as a disinfectant that protects the ants against microbial parasites scientists have long known that chemicals play a major role in insect communication the attraction of mates and defense against predators research on ants and other insects is a good example of how relevant chemistry is to the study of life unlike college courses nature is not neatly packaged into individual sciencesbiology chemistry physics and so forth biologists specialize in the study of life but organisms and their environments are natural systems to which the concepts of chemistry and physics apply biology is multidisciplinary this unit of chapters introduces some basic concepts of chemistry that apply to the study of life somewhere in the transition from molecules to cells we will cross the blurry boundary between nonlife and life this chapter focuses on the chemical components that make up all matter matter consists of chemical elements in pure form and in combinations called compounds organisms are composed of matter which is anything that takes up space and has mass matter exists in many forms rocks metals oils gases and living organisms are a few examples of what seems to be an endless assortment of matter elements and compounds matter is made up of elements an element is a substance that cannot be broken down to other substances by chemical reactions today chemists recognize 92 elements occurring in nature gold copper carbon and oxygen are examples each element has a symbol usually the first letter or two of its name some symbols are derived from latin or german for instance the symbol for sodium is na from the latin word natrium a compound is a substance consisting of two or more different elements combined in a fixed ratio table salt for example is sodium chloride nacl a compound composed of the elements sodium na and chlorine cl in a 11 ratio pure sodium is a metal and pure chlorine is a poisonous gas when chemically combined however sodium and chlorine form an edible compound water h2o another compound consists of the elements hydrogen h and oxygen in a 2 1 ratio these are simple examples of organized matter having emergent properties a compound has characteristics different from those of its elements the elements of life of the 92 natural elements about 2025 are essential elements that an organism needs to live a healthy life and reproduce the essential elements are similar among organisms but there is some variationfor example humans need 25 elements but plants need only 17 just four elementsoxygen o carbon c hydrogen h and nitrogen nmake up 96 of living matter calcium ca phosphorus p potassium k sulfur s and a few other elements account for most of the remaining 4 of an organisms mass trace elements are required by an organism in only minute quantities some trace elements such as iron fe are needed by all forms of life others are required only by certain species for example in vertebrates animals with backbones the element iodine i is an essential ingredient of a hormone produced by the thyroid gland a daily intake of only 015 milligram mg of iodine is adequate for normal activity of the human thyroid an iodine deficiency in the diet causes the thyroid gland to grow to abnormal size a condition called goiter where it is available eating seafood or iodized salt reduces the incidence of goiter all the elements needed by the human body are listed in table 21 some naturally occurring elements are toxic to organisms in humans for instance the element arsenic has been linked to numerous diseases and can be lethal in some areas of the world arsenic occurs naturally and can make its way into the groundwater as a result of using water from drilled wells in southern asia millions of people have been inadvertently exposed to arsenicladen water efforts are under way to reduce arsenic levels in their water supply case study evolution of tolerance to toxic elements e vo l u t i o n some species have become adapted to environments containing elements that are usually toxic an example is serpentine plant communities serpentine is a jadelike mineral that contains elevated concentrations of elements such as chromium nickel and cobalt although most plants cannot survive in soil that forms from serpentine rock a small number of plant species have adaptations that allow them to do so figure 23 presumably variants of ancestral nonserpentine species arose that could survive in serpentine soils and subsequent natural selection resulted in the distinctive array of species we see in these areas today researchers are studying whether serpentine adapted plants could take up toxic heavy metals in contaminated areas concentrating them for safer disposal,ants demonstrate how chemical mechanisms play a vital role in their survival and communication for example wood ants can defend their colonies by releasing formic acid when threatened illustrating the connection between chemistry and biology this highlights that biology is a multidisciplinary field where concepts from chemistry and physics are essential matter which occupies space and has mass consists of elements and compounds an element is a basic substance that cannot be chemically broken down while a compound consists of two or more elements in a fixed ratio about 2025 of the 92 natural elements are essential for life with just fouroxygen carbon hydrogen and nitrogenmaking up 96 of living matter trace elements like iodine and iron are also crucial but required in smaller amounts some species have adapted to survive in toxic environments as seen in serpentine plant communities where certain plants can thrive despite elevated levels of harmful elements like chromium and nickel
an elements properties depend on the structure of its atoms each element consists of a certain type of atom that is different from the atoms of any other element an atom is the smallest unit of matter that still retains the properties of an element atoms are so small that it would take about a million of them to stretch across the period printed at the end of this sentence we symbolize atoms with the same abbreviation used for the element that is made up of those atoms for example the symbol c stands for both the element carbon and a single carbon atom subatomic particles although the atom is the smallest unit having the properties of an element these tiny bits of matter are composed of even smaller parts called subatomic particles using highenergy collisions physicists have produced more than a hundred types of particles from the atom but only three kinds of particles are relevant here neutrons protons and electrons protons and electrons are electrically charged each proton has one unit of positive charge and each electron has one unit of negative charge a neutron as its name implies is electrically neutral protons and neutrons are packed together tightly in a dense core or atomic nucleus at the center of an atom protons give the nucleus a positive charge the rapidly moving electrons form a cloud of negative charge around the nucleus and it is the attraction between opposite charges that keeps the electrons in the vicinity of the nucleus shows two commonly used models of the structure of the helium atom as an example the neutron and proton are almost identical in mass each about 17 1024 gram g grams and other conventional units are not very useful for describing the mass of objects that are so minuscule thus for atoms and subatomic particles and for molecules too we use a unit of measurement called the dalton in honor of john dalton the british scientist who helped develop atomic theory around 1800 the dalton is the same as the atomic mass unit or amu a unit you may have encountered elsewhere neutrons and protons have masses close to 1 dalton because the mass of an electron is only about 12000 that of a neutron or proton we can ignore electrons when computing the total mass of an atom atomic number and atomic mass atoms of the various elements differ in their number of subatomic particles all atoms of a particular element have the same number of protons in their nuclei this number of protons which is unique to that element is called the atomic number and is written as a subscript to the left of the symbol for the element the abbreviation 2he for example tells us that an atom of the element helium has 2 protons in its nucleus unless otherwise indicated an atom is neutral in electrical charge which means that its protons must be balanced by an equal number of electrons therefore the atomic number tells us the number of protons and also the number of electrons in an electrically neutral atom we can deduce the number of neutrons from a second quantity the mass number which is the sum of protons plus neutrons in the nucleus of an atom the mass number is written as a superscript to the left of an elements symbol for example we can use this shorthand to write an atom of helium as 42he because the atomic number indicates how many protons there are we can determine the number of neutrons by subtracting the atomic number from the mass number accordingly the helium atom 42he has 2 neutrons for sodium na mass number number of protons neutrons 23 for sodium 23 11na atomic number number of protons number of electrons in a neutral atom 11 for sodium number of neutrons mass number atomic number 23 11 12 for sodium the simplest atom is hydrogen 11h which has no neutrons it consists of a single proton with a single electron because the contribution of electrons to mass is negligible almost all of an atoms mass is concentrated in its nucleus and since neutrons and protons each have a mass very close to 1 dalton the mass number is an approximation of the total mass of an atom called its atomic mass so we might say that the atomic mass of sodium 23 11na is 23 daltons although more precisely it is 229898 daltons isotopes all atoms of a given element have the same number of protons but some atoms have more neutrons than other atoms of the same element and therefore have greater mass these different atomic forms of the same element are called isotopes of the element in nature an element occurs as a mixture of its isotopes as an explanatory example lets consider the three naturally occurring isotopes of the element carbon which has the atomic number 6 the most common isotope is carbon12 126c which accounts for about 99 of the carbon in nature the isotope 126c has 6 neutrons most of the remaining 1 of carbon consists of atoms of the isotope 136c with 7 neutrons a third even rarer isotope 146c has 8 neutrons notice that all three isotopes of carbon have 6 protons otherwise they would not be carbon although the isotopes of an element have slightly different masses they behave identically in chemical reactions the number usually given as the atomic mass of an element such as 1201 daltons for carbon is actually an average of the atomic masses of all the elements naturally occurring isotopes weighted according to the abundance of each both 12c and 13c are stable isotopes meaning that their nuclei do not have a tendency to lose subatomic particles a process called decay the isotope 14c however is unstable or radioactive a radioactive isotope is one in which the nucleus decays spontaneously giving off particles and energy when the radioactive decay leads to a change in the number of protons it transforms the atom to an atom of a different element for example when an atom of carbon14 14c decays it becomes an atom of nitrogen 14n radioactive isotopes have many useful applications in biology,elements are made up of unique atoms which are the smallest units of matter that retain the properties of an element each atom consists of subatomic particles protons positively charged neutrons neutral and electrons negatively charged protons and neutrons are found in the dense nucleus at the center of the atom while electrons create a cloud around this nucleus the mass of neutrons and protons is nearly equal and since electrons are much lighter their mass is often ignored in calculations the atomic number of an element is determined by the number of protons in its nucleus and the mass number is the total number of protons and neutrons combined isotopes are variations of an element that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons leading to variations in mass for instance carbon has stable isotopes with one being the most common while another isotope is radioactive and can decay into nitrogen a process with important applications in biology
radioactive tracers radioactive isotopes are often used as diagnostic tools in medicine cells can use radioactive atoms just as they would use nonradioactive isotopes of the same element the radioactive isotopes are incorporated into biologically active molecules which are then used as tracers to track atoms during metabolism the chemical processes of an organism for example certain kidney disorders are diagnosed by injecting small doses of radioactivelylabeled substances into the blood and then analyzing the tracer molecules excreted in the urine radioactive tracers are also used in combination with sophisticated imaging instruments such as pet scanners that can monitor growth and metabolism of cancers in the body figure 25 although radioactive isotopes are very useful in biological research and medicine radiation from decaying isotopes also poses a hazard to life by damaging cellular molecules the severity of this damage depends on the type and amount of radiation an organism absorbs one of the most serious environmental threats is radioactive fallout from nuclear accidents the doses of most isotopes used in medical diagnosis however are relatively safe radiometric dating e vo l u t i o n researchers measure radioactive decay in fossils to date these relics of past life fossils provide a large body of evidence for evolution documenting differences between organisms from the past and those living at present and giving us insight into species that have disappeared over time while the layering of fossil beds establishes that deeper fossils are older than more shallow ones the actual age in years of the fossils in each layer cannot be determined by position alone this is where radioactive isotopes come in a parent isotope decays into its daughter isotope at a fixed rate expressed as the halflife of the isotopethe time it takes for 50 of the parent isotope to decay each radioactive isotope has a characteristic halflife that is not affected by temperature pressure or any other environmental variable using a process called radiometric dating scientists measure the ratio of different isotopes and calculate how many halflives in years have passed since an organism was fossilized or a rock was formed halflife values range from very short for some isotopes measured in seconds or days to extremely longuranium238 has a halflife of 45 billion years each isotope can best measure a particular range of years uranium 238 was used to determine that moon rocks are approximately 45 billion years old similar to the estimated age of earth in the scientific skills exercise you can work with data from an experiment that used carbon14 to determine the age of an important fossil youll learn more about radiometric dating of fossils in chapter 25 the energy levels of electrons the simplified models of the atom in figure 24 greatly exaggerate the size of the nucleus relative to that of the whole atom if an atom of helium were the size of a typical football stadium the nucleus would be the size of a pencil eraser in the center of the field moreover the electrons would be like two tiny gnats buzzing around the stadium atoms are mostly empty space when two atoms approach each other during a chemical reaction their nuclei do not come close enough to interact of the three subatomic particles we have discussed only electrons are directly involved in chemical reactions an atoms electrons vary in the amount of energy they possess energy is defined as the capacity to cause changefor instance by doing work potential energy is the energy that matter possesses because of its location or structure for example water in a reservoir on a hill has potential energy because of its altitude when the gates of the reservoirs dam are opened and the water runs downhill the energy can be used to do work such as moving the blades of turbines to generate electricity because energy has been expended the water has less energy at the bottom of the hill than it did in the reservoir matter has a natural tendency to move toward the lowest possible state of potential energy in our example the water runs downhill to restore the potential energy of a reservoir work must be done to elevate the water against gravity the electrons of an atom have potential energy due to their distance from the nucleus figure 26 the negatively charged electrons are attracted to the positively charged nucleus it takes work to move a given electron farther away from the nucleus so the more distant an electron is from the nucleus the greater its potential energy unlike the continuous flow of water downhill changes in the potential energy of electrons can occur only in steps of fixed amounts an electron having a certain amount of energy is something like a ball on a staircase figure 26a the ball can have different amounts of potential energy depending on which step it is on but it cannot spend much time between the steps similarly an electrons potential energy is determined by its energy level an electron can exist only at certain energy levels not between them an electrons energy level is correlated with its average distance from the nucleus electrons are found in different electron shells each with a characteristic average distance and energy level in diagrams shells can be represented by concentric circles figure 26b the first shell is closest to the nucleus and electrons in this shell have the lowest potential energy electrons in the second shell have more energy and electrons in the third shell even more energy an electron can move from one shell to another but only by absorbing or losing an amount of energy equal to the difference in potential energy between its position in the old shell and that in the new shell when an electron absorbs energy it moves to a shell farther out from the nucleus for example light energy can excite an electron to a higher energy level indeed this is the first step taken when plants harness the energy of sunlight for photosynthesis the process that produces food from carbon dioxide and water youll learn more about photosynthesis in chapter 10 when an electron loses energy it falls back to a shell closer to the nucleus and the lost energy is usually released to the environment as heat for example sunlight excites electrons in the surface of a car to higher energy levels when the electrons fall back to their original levels the cars surface heats up this thermal energy can be transferred to the air or to your hand if you touch the car,radioactive isotopes are valuable in medicine and biological research they are incorporated into biologically active molecules and used as tracers to monitor metabolic processes in living organisms for example radioactivelylabeled substances can diagnose kidney disorders while pet scanners can track cancer growth although they provide significant benefits radioactive isotopes also pose risks by damaging cellular molecules due to radiation exposure in paleontology scientists use radiometric dating to determine the age of fossils by measuring the decay of parent isotopes into daughter isotopes over known halflives researchers can estimate how long it has been since an organism died atoms consist mostly of empty space with electrons involved in chemical reactions electrons have potential energy based on their distance from the nucleus existing only at specific energy levels changes in an electrons energy level occur in discrete steps and energy can be absorbed or released as electrons move between levels influencing chemical processes like photosynthesis
electron distribution and chemical properties the chemical behavior of an atom is determined by the distribution of electrons in the atoms electron shells beginning with hydrogen the simplest atom we can imagine building the atoms of the other elements by adding 1 proton and 1 electron at a time along with an appropriate number of neutrons figure 27 an abbreviated version of what is called the periodic table of the elements shows this distribution of electrons for the first 18 elements from hydrogen 1h to argon 18ar the elements are arranged in three rows or periods corresponding to the number of electron shells in their atoms the lefttoright sequence of elements in each row corresponds to the sequential addition of electrons and protons see appendix b for the complete periodic table hydrogens 1 electron and heliums 2 electrons are located in the first shell electrons like all matter tend to exist in the lowest available state of potential energy in an atom this state is in the first shell however the first shell can hold no more than 2 electrons thus hydrogen and helium are the only elements in the first row of the table in an atom with more than 2 electrons the additional electrons must occupy higher shells because the first shell is full the next element lithium has 3 electrons two of these electrons fill the first shell while the third electron occupies the second shell the second shell holds a maximum of 8 electrons neon at the end of the second row has 8 electrons in the second shell giving it a total of 10 electrons the chemical behavior of an atom depends mostly on the number of electrons in its outermost shell we call those outer electrons valence electrons and the outermost electron shell the valence shell in the case of lithium there is only 1 valence electron and the second shell is the valence shell atoms with the same number of electrons in their valence shells exhibit similar chemical behavior for example fluorine f and chlorine cl both have 7 valence electrons and both form compounds when combined with the element sodium na sodium fluoride naf is commonly added to toothpaste to prevent tooth decay and as described earlier nacl is table salt see figure 22 an atom with a completed valence shell is unreactive that is it will not interact readily with other atoms at the far right of the periodic table are helium neon and argon the only three elements shown in figure 27 that have full valence shells these elements are said to be inert meaning chemically unreactive all the other atoms in figure 27 are chemically reactive because they have incomplete valence shells electron orbitals in the early 1900s the electron shells of an atom were visualized as concentric paths of electrons orbiting the nucleus somewhat like planets orbiting the sun it is still convenient to use twodimensional concentriccircle diagrams as in figure 27 to symbolize threedimensional electron shells however you need to remember that each concentric circle represents only the average distance between an electron in that shell and the nucleus accordingly the concentriccircle diagrams do not give a real picture of an atom in reality we can never know the exact location of an electron what we can do instead is describe the space in which an electron spends most of its time the threedimensional space where an electron is found 90 of the time is called an orbital each electron shell contains electrons at a particular energy level distributed among a specific number of orbitals of distinctive shapes and orientations figure 28 shows the orbitals of neon as an example with its electron distribution diagram for reference you can think of an orbital as a component of an electron shell the first electron shell has only one spherical s orbital called 1s but the second shell has four orbitals one large spherical s orbital called 2s and three dumbbellshaped p orbitals called 2p orbitals the third shell and other higher electron shells also have s and p orbitals as well as orbitals of more complex shapes no more than 2 electrons can occupy a single orbital the first electron shell can therefore accommodate up to 2 electrons in its s orbital the lone electron of a hydrogen atom occupies the 1s orbital as do the 2 electrons of a helium atom the four orbitals of the second electron shell can hold up to 8 electrons 2 in each orbital electrons in each of the four orbitals have nearly the same energy but they move in different volumes of space the reactivity of an atom arises from the presence of unpaired electrons in one or more orbitals of its valence shell as you will see in the next section atoms interact in a way that completes their valence shells when they do so it is the unpaired electrons that are involved a electron distribution diagram an electron distribution diagram is shown here for a neon atom which has a total of 10 electrons each concentric circle represents an electron shell which can be subdivided into electron orbitals b separate electron orbitals the threedimensional shapes represent electron orbitalsthe volumes of space where the electrons of an atom are most likely to be found each orbital holds a maximum of 2 electrons the first electron shell on the left has one spherical s orbital designated 1s the second shell on the right has one larger s orbital designated 2s for the second shell plus three dumbbellshaped orbitals called p orbitals 2p for the second shell the three 2p orbitals lie at right angles to one another along imaginary x y and zaxes of the atom each 2p orbital is outlined here in a different color c superimposed electron orbitals to reveal the complete picture of the electron orbitals of neon we superimpose the 1s orbital of the first shell and the 2s and three 2p orbitals of the second shell,the chemical behavior of an atom is dictated by the arrangement of electrons in its electron shells each shell can accommodate a specific number of electrons the first shell holds a maximum of 2 while the second can hold up to 8 the outermost electrons known as valence electrons determine how an atom interacts with others atoms with full valence shells such as helium neon and argon are termed inert and do not react easily while those with incomplete valence shells are chemically reactive electrons exist in regions called orbitals which define the probability of an electrons presence in a given area around the nucleus the first shell has one spherical 1s orbital while the second shell contains one larger spherical 2s orbital and three dumbbellshaped 2p orbitals the reactivity of an atom arises from the presence of unpaired electrons in its valence shell atoms interact in ways that complete their valence shells achieving greater stability this understanding of electron distribution is fundamental to grasping chemical reactions and bonding behaviors in various elements
the formation and function of molecules depend on chemical bonding between atoms now that we have looked at the structure of atoms we can move up the hierarchy of organization and see how atoms combine to form molecules and ionic compounds atoms with incomplete valence shells can interact with certain other atoms in such a way that each partner completes its valence shell the atoms either share or transfer valence electrons these interactions usually result in atoms staying close together held by attractions called chemical bonds the strongest kinds of chemical bonds are covalent bonds and ionic bonds when in dry ionic compounds covalent bonds a covalent bond is the sharing of a pair of valence electrons by two atoms for example lets consider what happens when two hydrogen atoms approach each other recall that hydrogen has 1 valence electron in the first shell but the shells capacity is 2 electrons when the two hydrogen atoms come close enough for their 1s orbitals to overlap they can share their electrons figure 29 each hydrogen atom is now associated with 2 electrons in what amounts to a completed valence shell two or more atoms held together by covalent bonds constitute a molecule in this case a hydrogen molecule figure 210a shows several ways of representing a hydrogen molecule its molecular formula h2 simply indicates that the molecule consists of two atoms of hydrogen electron sharing can be depicted by an electron distribution diagram or by a lewis dot structure in which element symbols are surrounded by dots that represent the valence electrons h h we can also use a structural formula hh where the line represents a single bond a pair of shared electrons a spacefilling model comes closest to representing the actual shape of the molecule you may also be familiar with ballandstick models which are shown in figure 215 oxygen has 6 electrons in its second electron shell and therefore needs 2 more electrons to complete its valence shell two oxygen atoms form a molecule by sharing two pairs of valence electrons figure 210b the atoms are thus joined by what is called a double bond oo each atom that can share valence electrons has a bonding capacity corresponding to the number of covalent bonds the atom can form when the bonds form they give the atom a full complement of electrons in the valence shell the bonding capacity of oxygen for example is 2 this bonding capacity is called the atoms valence and usually equals the number of unpaired electrons required to complete the atoms outermost valence shell see if you can determine the valences of hydrogen oxygen nitrogen and carbon by studying the electron distribution diagrams in figure 27 you can see that the valence of hydrogen is 1 oxygen 2 nitrogen 3 and carbon 4 however the situation is more complicated for elements in the third row of the periodic table phosphorus for example can have a valence of 3 as we would predict from the presence of 3 unpaired electrons in its valence shell in some molecules that are biologically important however phosphorus can form three single bonds and one double bond therefore it can also have a valence of 5 the molecules h2 and o2 are pure elements rather than compounds because a compound is a combination of two or more different elements water with the molecular formula h2o is a compound two atoms of hydrogen are needed to satisfy the valence of one oxygen atom figure 210c shows the structure of a water molecule water is so important to life that chapter 3 is devoted entirely to its structure and behavior methane the main component of natural gas is a compound with the molecular formula ch4 it takes four hydrogen atoms each with a valence of 1 to complement one atom of carbon with its valence of 4 figure 210d we will look at many other compounds of carbon in chapter 4 atoms in a molecule attract shared bonding electrons to varying degrees depending on the element the attraction of a particular atom for the electrons of a covalent bond is called its electronegativity the more electronegative an atom is the more strongly it pulls shared electrons toward itself in a covalent bond between two atoms of the same element the electrons are shared equally because the two atoms have the same electronegativitythe tugofwar is at a standoff such a bond is called a nonpolar covalent bond for example the single bond of h2 is nonpolar as is the double bond of o2 however when an atom is bonded to a more electronegative atom the electrons of the bond are not shared equally this type of bond is called a polar covalent bond such bonds vary in their polarity depending on the relative electronegativity of the two atoms for example the bonds between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms of a water molecule are quite polar figure 211 oxygen is one of the most electronegative elements attracting shared electrons much more strongly than hydrogen does in a covalent bond between oxygen and hydrogen the electrons spend more time near the oxygen nucleus than they do near the hydrogen nucleus because electrons have a negative charge and are pulled toward oxygen in a water molecule the oxygen atom has a partial negative charge indicated by the greek letter with a minus sign or delta minus and each hydrogen atom has a partial positive charge or delta plus in contrast the individual bonds of methane ch4 are much less polar because the electronegativities of carbon and hydrogen are similar,the formation and function of molecules arise from chemical bonds between atoms which can either share or transfer electrons to complete their valence shells the two main types of chemical bonds are covalent bonds where electrons are shared between atoms and ionic bonds where electrons are transferred covalent bonds can be represented by molecular formulas lewis dot structures or structural formulas for example a hydrogen molecule h consists of two hydrogen atoms sharing electrons while two oxygen atoms form a double bond o by sharing two pairs of electrons the valence of an atom indicates its bonding capacity which corresponds to the number of unpaired electrons needed to complete its valence shell for instance hydrogen has a valence of 1 oxygen has a valence of 2 nitrogen has a valence of 3 and carbon has a valence of 4 molecules can exhibit polar or nonpolar covalent bonds depending on the difference in electronegativity between the bonded atoms water ho is a polar molecule where oxygen pulls shared electrons closer resulting in partial charges conversely methane ch has nonpolar bonds due to similar electronegativities between carbon and hydrogen
ionic bonds in some cases two atoms are so unequal in their attraction for valence electrons that the more electronegative atom strips an electron completely away from its partner the two resulting oppositely charged atoms or molecules are called ions a positively charged ion is called a cation while a negatively charged ion is called an anion because of their opposite charges cations and anions attract each other this attraction is called an ionic bond note that the transfer of an electron is not by itself the formation of a bond rather it allows a bond to form because it results in two ions of opposite charge any two ions of opposite charge can form an ionic bond the ions do not need to have acquired their charge by an electron transfer with each other this is what happens when an atom of sodium 11na encounters an atom of chlorine 17cl figure 212 a sodium atom has a total of 11 electrons with its single valence electron in the third electron shell a chlorine atom has a total of 17 electrons with 7 electrons in its valence shell when these two atoms meet the lone valence electron of sodium is transferred to the chlorine atom and both atoms end up with their valence shells complete because sodium no longer has an electron in the third shell the second shell is now the valence shell the electron transfer between the two atoms moves one unit of negative charge from sodium to chlorine sodium now with 11 protons but only 10 electrons has a net electrical charge of 1 the sodium atom has become a cation conversely the chlorine atom having gained an extra electron now has 17 protons and 18 electrons giving it a net electrical charge of 1 it has become a chloride ionan anion compounds formed by ionic bonds are called ionic compounds or salts we know the ionic compound sodium chloride nacl as table salt figure 213 he sodium ions na and chloride ions cl are held together by ionic bonds the formula nacl tells us that the ratio of na to cl is 11 a threedimensional lattice unlike a covalent compound which consists of molecules having a definite size and number of atoms an ionic compound does not consist of molecules the formula for an ionic compound such as nacl indicates only the ratio of elements in a crystal of the salt nacl by itself is not a molecule not all salts have equal numbers of cations and anions for example the ionic compound magnesium chloride mgcl2 has two chloride ions for each magnesium ion magnesium 12mg must lose 2 outer electrons if the atom is to have a complete valence shell so it has a tendency to become a cation with a net charge of 2 mg2 one magnesium cation can therefore form ionic bonds with two chloride anions cl the term ion also applies to entire molecules that are electrically charged in the salt ammonium chloride nh4cl for instance the anion is a single chloride ion cl but the cation is ammonium nh4 a nitrogen atom covalently bonded to four hydrogen atoms the whole ammonium ion has an electrical charge of 1 because it has given up 1 electron and thus is 1 electron short environment affects the strength of ionic bonds in a dry salt crystal the bonds are so strong that it takes a hammer and chisel to break enough of them to crack the crystal in two if the same salt crystal is dissolved in water however the ionic bonds are much weaker because each ion is partially shielded by its interactions with water molecules most drugs are manufactured as salts because they are quite stable when dry but can dissociate come apart easily in water in the next chapter you will learn how water dissolves salts weak chemical bonds in organisms most of the strongest chemical bonds are covalent bonds which link atoms to form a cells molecules but weaker bonding within and between molecules is also indispensable contributing greatly to the emergent properties of life many large biological molecules are held in their functional form by weak bonds in addition when two molecules in the cell make contact they may adhere temporarily by weak bonds the reversibility of weak bonding can be an advantage two molecules can come together respond to one another in some way and then separate several types of weak chemical bonds are important in organisms one is the ionic bond as it exists between ions dissociated in water which we just discussed hydrogen bonds and van der waals interactions are also crucial to life hydrogen bonds among weak chemical bonds hydrogen bonds are so central to the chemistry of life that they deserve special attention when a hydrogen atom is covalently bonded to an electronegative atom the hydrogen atom has a partial positive charge that allows it to be attracted to a different electronegative atom nearby this attraction between a hydrogen and an electronegative atom is called a hydrogen bond in living cells the electronegative partners are usually oxygen or nitrogen atoms refer to figure 214 to examine the simple case of hydrogen bonding between water h2o and ammonia nh3 van der waals interactions even a molecule with nonpolar covalent bonds may have positively and negatively charged regions electrons are not always evenly distributed at any instant they may accumulate by chance in one part of a molecule or another the results are everchanging regions of positive and negative charge that enable all atoms and molecules to stick to one another these van der waals interactions are individually weak and occur only when atoms and molecules are very close together when many such interactions occur simultaneously however they can be powerful van der waals interactions allow a gecko lizard below to walk straight up a wall the anatomy of the geckos footincluding many minuscule hairlike projections from the toes and strong tendons underlying the skinstrikes a balance between maximum surface contact with the wall and necessary stiffness of the foot the van der waals interactions between the foot molecules and the molecules of the walls surface are so numerous that despite their individual weakness together they can support the geckos body weight this discovery has inspired development of an artificial adhesive called geckskin a patch the size of an index card can hold a 700 pound weight to a wall van der waals interactions hydrogen bonds ionic bonds in water and other weak bonds may form not only between molecules but also between parts of a large molecule such as a protein the cumulative effect of weak bonds is to reinforce the threedimensional shape of the molecule you will learn more about the very important biological roles of weak bonds in chapter 5,ionic bonds occur when there is a significant difference in electronegativity between two atoms resulting in one atom completely stripping an electron from the other this creates ions cations positively charged and anions negatively charged these oppositely charged ions attract each other forming ionic bonds for example in sodium chloride nacl a sodium atom transfers its lone valence electron to a chlorine atom resulting in na and cl ions which combine in a 11 ratio to form the ionic compound compounds like magnesium chloride mgcl illustrate how one magnesium ion can bond with multiple chloride ions due to its 2 charge weak chemical bonds play essential roles in biological systems while covalent bonds create stable molecules weak bonds contribute to molecular interactions and structures hydrogen bonds which form when a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to an electronegative atom attracts another electronegative atom are crucial for the properties of water and biological macromolecules van der waals interactions arise from temporary charge fluctuations in molecules allowing even nonpolar molecules to stick together together these weak bonds facilitate essential biological functions such as molecular recognition and the stability of protein structures
molecular shape and function a molecule has a characteristic size and precise shape which are crucial to its function in the living cell a molecule consisting of two atoms such as h2 or o2 is always linear but most molecules with more than two atoms have more complicated shapes these shapes are determined by the positions of the atoms orbitals figure 215 when an atom forms covalent bonds the orbitals in its valence shell undergo rearrangement for atoms with valence electrons in both s and p orbitals review figure 28 the single s and three p orbitals form four new hybrid orbitals shaped like identical teardrops extending from the region of the atomic nucleus figure 215a if we connect the larger ends of the teardrops with lines we have the outline of a geometric shape called a tetrahedron a pyramid with a triangular base for water molecules h2o two of the hybrid orbitals in the oxygens valence shell are shared with hydrogens figure 215b the result is a molecule shaped roughly like a v with its two covalent bonds at an angle of 1045 the methane molecule ch4 has the shape of a completed tetrahedron because all four hybrid orbitals of the carbon atom are shared with hydrogen atoms see figure 215b the carbon nucleus is at the center with its four covalent bonds radiating to hydrogen nuclei at the corners of the tetrahedron larger molecules containing multiple carbon atoms including many of the molecules that make up living matter have more complex overall shapes however the tetrahedral shape of a carbon atom bonded to four other atoms is often a repeating motif within such molecules molecular shape is crucial it determines how biological molecules recognize and respond to one another with specificity biological molecules often bind temporarily to each other by forming weak bonds but only if their shapes are complementary consider the effects of opiates drugs such as morphine and heroin derived from opium opiates relieve pain and alter mood by weakly binding to specific receptor molecules on the surfaces of brain cells why would brain cells carry receptors for opiates compounds that are not made by the body in 1975 the discovery of endorphins answered this question endorphins are signaling molecules made by the pituitary gland that bind to the receptors relieving pain and producing euphoria durisng times of stress such as intense exercise opiates have shapes similar to endorphins and mimic them by binding to endorphin receptors in the brain that is why opiates and endorphins have similar effects figure 216 the role of molecular shape in brain chemistry illustrates how biological organization leads to a match between structure and function one of biologys unifying themes a hybridization of orbitals the single s and three p orbitals of a valence shell involved in covalent bonding combine to form four teardropshaped hybrid orbitals these orbitals extend to the four corners of an imaginary tetrahedron b molecularshape models three models representing molecular shape are shown for water and methane the positions of the hybrid orbitals determine the shapes of the molecules,molecular shape is essential for the function of biological molecules in living cells while diatomic molecules like h or o are linear molecules with more than two atoms exhibit more complex shapes determined by the arrangement of atomic orbitals when atoms form covalent bonds their valence orbitals hybridize leading to new shapes for example in methane ch carbon forms four hybrid orbitals that create a tetrahedral shape with each corner representing a covalent bond to hydrogen in contrast water ho has a vshaped structure due to the two covalent bonds formed with hydrogen at an angle of 1045 the specific shapes of molecules are crucial for their interactions biological recognition often depends on complementary shapes for instance opiates like morphine mimic the structure of endorphins the bodys natural pain relievers this similarity allows opiates to bind to endorphin receptors in the brain providing pain relief and euphoria such examples illustrate how molecular shape influences function highlighting a fundamental theme in biology where structure and function are intricately linked
chemical reactions make and break chemical bonds the making and breaking of chemical bonds leading to changes in the composition of matter are called chemical reactions an example is the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen molecules that forms water this reaction breaks the covalent bonds of h2 and o2 and forms the new bonds of h2o when we write a chemical reaction we use an arrow to indicate the conversion of the starting materials called the reactants to the products the coefficients indicate the number of molecules involved for example the coefficient 2 in front of the h2 means that the reaction starts with two molecules of hydrogen notice that all atoms of the reactants must be accounted for in the products matter is conserved in a chemical reaction reactions cannot create or destroy atoms but can only rearrange redistribute the electrons among them photosynthesis which takes place within the cells of green plant tissues is an important biological example of how chemical reactions rearrange matter humans and other animals ultimately depend on photosynthesis for food and oxygen and this process is at the foundation of almost all ecosystems the following chemical shorthand summarizes the process of photosynthesis the raw materials of photosynthesis are carbon dioxide co2 which is taken from the air and water h2o which is absorbed from the soil within the plant cells sunlight powers the conversion of these ingredients to a sugar called glucose c6h12o6 and oxygen molecules o2 a byproduct that the plant releases into the surroundings figure 217 although photosynthesis is actually a sequence of many chemical reactions we still end up with the same number and types of atoms that we had when we started matter has simply been rearranged with an input of energy provided by sunlight all chemical reactions are reversible with the products of the forward reaction becoming the reactants for the reverse reaction for example hydrogen and nitrogen molecules can combine to form ammonia but ammonia can also decompose to regenerate hydrogen and nitrogen the two oppositeheaded arrows indicate that the reaction is reversible one of the factors affecting the rate of a reaction is the concentration of reactants the greater the concentration of reactant molecules the more frequently they collide with one another and have an opportunity to react and form products the same holds true for products as products accumulate collisions resulting in the reverse reaction become more frequent eventually the forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate and the relative concentrations of products and reactants stop changing the point at which the reactions offset one another exactly is called chemical equilibrium this is a dynamic equilibrium reactions are still going on but with no net effect on the concentrations of reactants and products equilibrium does not mean that the reactants and products are equal in concentration but only that their concentrations have stabilized at a particular ratio the reaction involving ammonia reaches equilibrium when ammonia decomposes as rapidly as it forms in some chemi cal reactions the equilibrium point may lie so far to the right that these reactions go essentially to completion that is virtually all the reactants are converted to products we will return to the subject of chemical reactions after more detailed study of the various types of molecules that are important to life in the next chapter we focus on water the substance in which all the chemical processes of organ isms occur,chemical reactions involve the making and breaking of chemical bonds leading to changes in matters composition for instance the reaction between hydrogen h and oxygen o forms water ho by breaking existing covalent bonds and creating new ones in a chemical equation reactants transform into products with coefficients indicating the number of molecules involved matter is conserved reactions rearrange atoms without creating or destroying them key concepts include reactants and products starting materials reactants are transformed into products photosynthesis an example of a biological reaction where carbon dioxide co and water ho are converted into glucose cho and oxygen o using sunlight reversibility all reactions are reversible with the forward reaction converting reactants to products and vice versa chemical equilibrium a state where the rates of forward and reverse reactions are equal stabilizing the concentrations of reactants and products in conclusion understanding chemical reactions is fundamental for grasping processes like photosynthesis essential for life on earth
the molecule that supports all of life life on earth began in water and evolved there for 3 billion years before spread ing onto land water is the substance that makes possible life as we know it here on earth all organisms familiar to us are made mostly of water and live in an environment dominated by water water is the biological medium here on earth and possibly on other planets as well threequarters of earths surface is covered by water although most of this water is in liquid form water is also present on earth as a solid ice and a gas water vapor water is the only common substance to exist in the natural environment in all three physical states of matter furthermore the solid state of water floats on the liquid a rare property emerging from the chemistry of the water molecule all three states of water can be seen in figure 31 which shows water vapor rising from hot springs that feed into a partially frozen lake in hokkaido japan the lake is a migratory stop for the elegant whooper swan cygnus cygnus the growing young require a watery habitat because their legs cant support their body weight on land for long periods of time in this chapter you will learn how the structure of a water molecule allows it to interact with other molecules including other water molecules this ability leads to waters unique emergent properties that help make earth suitable for life polar covalent bonds in water molecules result in hydrogen bonding water is so familiar to us that it is easy to overlook its many extraordinary qualities following the theme of emergent properties we can trace waters unique behavior to the structure and interactions of its molecules studied on its own the water molecule is deceptively simple it is shaped like a wide v with its two hydrogen atoms joined to the oxygen atom by single covalent bonds oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen so the electrons of the covalent bonds spend more time closer to oxygen than to hydrogen these are polar covalent bonds see figure 211 this unequal sharing of electrons and waters vlike shape make it a polar molecule meaning that its overall charge is unevenly distributed in water the oxygen region of the molecule has a partial negative charge and each hydrogen has a partial positive charge the properties of water arise from attractions between oppositely charged atoms of different water molecules the slightly positive hydrogen of one molecule is attracted to the slightly negative oxygen of a nearby molecule the two molecules are thus held together by a hydrogen bond figure 32 when water is in its liquid form its hydrogen bonds are very fragile each only about 120 as strong as a covalent bond the hydrogen bonds form break and reform with great frequency each lasts only a few trillionths of a second but the molecules are constantly forming new hydrogen bonds with a succession of partners therefore at any instant most of the water molecules are hydrogenbonded to their neighbors the extraordinary properties of water emerge from this hydrogen bonding which organizes water molecules into a higher level of structural order,water is essential for life on earth having existed in various forms for billions of years covering threequarters of the planets surface water is unique as it can exist in solid ice liquid and gaseous water vapor states simultaneously this ability is due to the structure of the water molecule which is shaped like a wide v with two hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to an oxygen atom the oxygen atom is more electronegative creating polar covalent bonds that result in an uneven distribution of chargemaking water a polar molecule key points include hydrogen bonds the slight positive charge of hydrogen atoms in one water molecule attracts the slight negative charge of oxygen in another forming hydrogen bonds that are fragile yet constantly forming and breaking in liquid water emergent properties these hydrogen bonds lead to waters unique properties including its ability to dissolve substances high surface tension and the floating of ice on liquid water all critical for sustaining life biological medium water serves as the biological medium for organisms highlighting its importance for life on earth and potentially on other planets
four emergent properties of water contribute to earths suitability for life we will examine four emergent properties of water that contribute to earths suitability as an environment for life cohesive behavior ability to moderate temperature expansion upon freezing and versatility as a solvent cohesion of water molecules water molecules stay close to each other as a result of hydrogen bonding although the arrangement of molecules in a sample of liquid water is constantly changing at any given moment many of the molecules are linked by multiple hydrogen bonds these linkages make water more structured than most other liquids collectively the hydrogen bonds hold the substance together a phenomenon called cohesion cohesion due to hydrogen bonding contributes to the transport of water and dissolved nutrients against gravity in plants water from the roots reaches the leaves through a network of waterconducting cells figure 33 as water evaporates from a leaf hydrogen bonds cause water molecules leaving the veins to tug on molecules farther down and the upward pull is transmitted through the waterconducting cells all the way to the roots adhesion the clinging of one substance to another also plays a role adhesion of water by hydrogen bonds to the molecules of cell walls helps counter the downward pull of gravity see figure 33 related to cohesion is surface tension a measure of how difficult it is to stretch or break the surface of a liquid at the interface between water and air is an ordered arrangement of water molecules hydrogenbonded to one another and to the water below this gives water an unusually high surface tension making it behave as though it were coated with an invisible film you can observe the surface tension of water by slightly overfilling a drinking glass the water will stand above the rim the spider in figure 34 takes advantage of the surface tension of water to walk across a pond without breaking the surface moderation of temperature by water water moderates air temperature by absorbing heat from air that is warmer and releasing the stored heat to air that is cooler water is effective as a heat bank because it can absorb or release a relatively large amount of heat with only a slight change in its own temperature to understand this capability of water lets first look at temperature and heat temperature and heat anything that moves has kinetic energy the energy of motion atoms and molecules have kinetic energy because they are always moving although not necessarily in any particular direction the faster a molecule moves the greater its kinetic energy the kinetic energy associated with the random movement of atoms or molecules is called thermal energy thermal energy is related to temperature but they are not the same thing temperature is a measure of energy that represents the average kinetic energy of the molecules in a body of matter regardless of volume whereas the total thermal energy depends in part on the matters volume when water is heated in a coffeemaker the average speed of the molecules increases and the thermometer records this as a rise in temperature of the liquid the total amount of thermal energy also increases in this case note however that although the pot of coffee has a much higher temperature than say the water in a swimming pool the swimming pool contains more thermal energy because of its much greater volume whenever two objects of different temperature are brought together thermal energy passes from the warmer to the cooler object until the two are the same temperature molecules in the cooler object speed up at the expense of the thermal energy of the warmer object an ice cube cools a drink not by adding coldness to the liquid but by absorbing thermal energy from the liquid as the ice itself melts thermal energy in transfer from one body of matter to another is defined as heat one convenient unit of heat used in this book is the calorie cal a calorie is the amount of heat it takes to raise the temperature of 1 g of water by 1c conversely a calorie is also the amount of heat that 1 g of water releases when it cools by 1c a kilocalorie kcal 1000 cal is the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 kilogram kg of water by 1c the calories on food packages are actually kilocalories another energy unit used in this book is the joule j one joule equals 0239 cal one calorie equals 4184 j waters high specific heat the ability of water to stabilize temperature stems from its relatively high specific heat the specific heat of a substance is defined as the amount of heat that must be absorbed or lost for 1 g of that substance to change its temperature by 1c we already know waters specific heat because we have defined a calorie as the amount of heat that causes 1 g of water to change its temperature by 1c therefore the specific heat of water is 1 calorie per gram and per degree celsius abbreviated as 1 calg c compared with most other substances water has an unusually high specific heat for example ethyl alcohol the type of alcohol in alcoholic beverages has a specific heat of 06 calg c that is only 06 cal is required to raise the temperature of 1 g of ethyl alcohol by 1c because of the high specific heat of water relative to other materials water will change its temperature less than other liquids when it absorbs or loses a given amount of heat the reason you can burn your fingers by touching the side of an iron pot on the stove when the water in the pot is still lukewarm is that the specific heat of water is ten times greater than that of iron in other words the same amount of heat will raise the temperature of 1 g of the iron much faster than it will raise the temperature of 1 g of the water specific heat can be thought of as a measure of how well a substance resists changing its temperature when it absorbs or releases heat water resists changing its temperature when it does change its temperature it absorbs or loses a relatively large quantity of heat for each degree of change we can trace waters high specific heat like many of its other properties to hydrogen bonding heat must be absorbed in order to break hydrogen bonds by the same token heat is released when hydrogen bonds form a calorie of heat causes a relatively small change in the temperature of water because much of the heat is used to disrupt hydrogen bonds before the water molecules can begin moving faster and when the temperature of water drops slightly many additional hydrogen bonds form releasing a considerable amount of energy in the form of heat what is the relevance of waters high specific heat to life on earth a large body of water can absorb and store a huge amount of heat from the sun in the daytime and during summer while warming up only a few degrees at night and during winter the gradually cooling water can warm the air this capability of water serves to moderate air temperatures in coastal areas figure 35 the high specific heat of water also tends to stabilize ocean temperatures creating a favorable environment for marine life thus because of its high specific heat the water that covers most of earth keeps temperature fluctuations on land and in water within limits that permit life also because organisms are made primarily of water they are better able to resist changes in their own temperature than if they were made of a liquid with a lower specific heat,water possesses four emergent properties that are vital for making earth suitable for life cohesive behavior temperature moderation expansion upon freezing and versatility as a solvent cohesive behavior water molecules exhibit cohesion due to hydrogen bonding enabling them to stay close together this property aids in the transport of water and nutrients in plants as evaporation from leaves pulls water up from the roots the high surface tension of water a result of cohesion allows certain organisms to walk on its surface moderation of temperature water can absorb and release significant amounts of heat with minimal temperature change acting as a temperature buffer this property is attributed to its high specific heat defined as the heat required to change the temperature of 1 g of water by 1c this stability allows aquatic environments to maintain a suitable climate for life expansion upon freezing water expands when it freezes causing ice to float on liquid water this unique property insulates aquatic habitats allowing life to thrive beneath the surface during cold weather versatility as a solvent waters polarity makes it an excellent solvent facilitating biochemical reactions essential for life these properties demonstrate how waters unique chemistry supports biological processes and sustains life on earth
evaporative cooling molecules of any liquid stay close together because they are attracted to one another molecules moving fast enough to overcome these attractions can depart the liquid and enter the air as a gas vapor this transformation from a liquid to a gas is called vaporization or evaporation recall that the speed of molecular movement varies and that temperature is the average kinetic energy of molecules even at low temperatures the speediest molecules can escape into the air some evaporation occurs at any temperature a glass of water at room temperature for example will eventually evaporate completely if a liquid is heated the average kinetic energy of molecules increases and the liquid evaporates more rapidly heat of vaporization is the quantity of heat a liquid must absorb for 1 g of it to be converted from the liquid to the gaseous state for the same reason that water has a high specific heat it also has a high heat of vaporization relative to most other liquids to evaporate 1 g of water at 25c about 580 cal of heat is needednearly double the amount needed to vaporize a gram of alcohol or ammonia waters high heat of vaporization is another emergent property resulting from the strength of its hydrogen bonds which must be broken before the molecules can exit from the liquid in the form of water vapor see figure 31 the high amount of energy required to vaporize water has a wide range of effects on a global scale for example it helps moderate earths climate a considerable amount of solar heat absorbed by tropical seas is consumed during the evaporation of surface water then as moist tropical air circulates poleward it releases heat as it condenses and forms rain on an organismal level waters high heat of vaporization accounts for the severity of steam burns these burns are caused by the heat energy released when steam condenses into liquid on the skin as a liquid evaporates the surface of the liquid that remains behind cools down its temperature decreases this evaporative cooling occurs because the hottest molecules those with the greatest kinetic energy are the most likely to leave as gas it is as if the hundred fastest runners at a college transferred to another school the average speed of the remaining students would decline evaporative cooling of water contributes to the stability of temperature in lakes and ponds and also provides a mechanism that prevents terrestrial organisms from overheating for example evaporation of water from the leaves of a plant helps keep the tissues in the leaves from becoming too warm in the sunlight evaporation of sweat from human skin dissipates body heat and helps prevent overheating on a hot day or when excess heat is generated by strenuous activity high humidity on a hot day increases discomfort because the high concentration of water vapor in the air inhibits the evaporation of sweat from the body floating of ice on liquid water water is one of the few substances that are less dense as a solid than as a liquid in other words ice floats on liquid water while other materials contract and become denser when they solidify water expands the cause of this exotic behavior is once again hydrogen bonding at temperatures above 4c water behaves like other liquids expanding as it warms and contracting as it cools as the temperature falls from 4c to 0c water begins to freeze because more and more of its molecules are moving too slowly to break hydrogen bonds at 0c the molecules become locked into a crystalline lattice each water molecule hydrogenbonded to four partners figure 36 the hydrogen bonds keep the molecules at arms length far enough apart to make ice about 10 less dense 10 fewer molecules for the same volume than liquid water at 4c when ice absorbs enough heat for its temperature to rise above 0c hydrogen bonds between molecules are disrupted as the crystal collapses the ice melts and molecules are free to slip closer together water reaches its greatest density at 4c and then begins to expand as the molecules move faster even in liquid water many of the molecules are connected by hydrogen bonds though only transiently the hydrogen bonds are constantly breaking and reforming the ability of ice to float due to its lower density is an important factor in the suitability of the environment for life if ice sank then eventually all ponds lakes and even oceans would freeze solid making life as we know it impossible on earth during summer only the upper few inches of the ocean would thaw instead when a deep body of water cools the floating ice insulates the liquid water below preventing it from freezing and allowing life to exist under the frozen surface as shown in the photo in figure 36 besides insulating the water below ice also provides a solid habitat for some animals such as polar bears and seals many scientists are worried that these bodies of ice are at risk of disappearing global warming which is caused by carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is having a profound effect on icy environments around the globe in the arctic the average air temperature has risen 14c just since 1961 this temperature increase has affected the seasonal balance between arctic sea ice and liquid water causing ice to form later in the year to melt earlier and to cover a smaller area the rate at which glaciers and arctic sea ice are disappearing is posing an extreme challenge to animals that depend on ice for their survival,water exhibits unique properties essential for life including evaporative cooling and the ability of ice to float on liquid water evaporative cooling this process occurs when fastmoving water molecules escape into the air as gas leading to a decrease in temperature of the remaining liquid waters high heat of vaporization 580 calories for 1 g at 25c helps moderate global climate and prevents organisms from overheating for instance sweating cools human bodies while plant leaves maintain temperature through water evaporation floating of ice water is less dense as a solid ice than as a liquid allowing ice to float this occurs because ices hydrogen bonds create a crystalline structure that keeps molecules spaced apart making it about 10 less dense than liquid water at 4c this property is crucial for aquatic ecosystems as floating ice insulates water below enabling life to thrive beneath the surface however climate change threatens these vital features particularly the melting of ice which disrupts habitats and ecosystems
water the solvent of life a sugar cube placed in a glass of water will dissolve with a little stirring the glass will then contain a uniform mixture of sugar and water the concentration of dissolved sugar will be the same everywhere in the mixture a liquid that is a completely homogeneous mixture of two or more substances is called a solution the dissolving agent of a solution is the solvent and the substance that is dissolved is the solute in this case water is the solvent and sugar is the solute an aqueous solution is one in which the solute is dissolved in water water is the solvent water is a very versatile solvent a quality we can trace to the polarity of the water molecule suppose for example that a spoonful of table salt the ionic compound sodium chloride nacl is placed in water figure 37 at the surface of each grain or crystal of salt the sodium and chloride ions are exposed to the solvent these ions and regions of the water molecules are attracted to each other due to their opposite charges the oxygen regions of the water molecules are negatively charged and are attracted to sodium cations the hydrogen regions are positively charged and are attracted to chloride anions as a result water molecules surround the individual sodium and chloride ions separating and shielding them from one another the sphere of water molecules around each dissolved ion is called a hydration shell working inward from the surface of each salt crystal water eventually dissolves all the ions the result is a solution of two solutes sodium cations and chloride anions homogeneously mixed with water the solvent other ionic compounds also dissolve in water seawater for instance contains a great variety of dissolved ions as do living cells a compound does not need to be ionic to dissolve in water many compounds made up of nonionic polar molecules such as the sugar in the sugar cube mentioned earlier are also watersoluble such compounds dissolve when water molecules surround each of the solute molecules forming hydrogen bonds with them even molecules as large as proteins can dissolve in water if they have ionic and polar regions on their surface figure 38 many different kinds of polar compounds are dissolved along with ions in the water of such biological fluids as blood the sap of plants and the liquid within all cells water is the solvent of life,waters ability to dissolve various substances is critical for biological systems a solution is a uniform mixture of a solvent dissolving agent and a solute dissolved substance in an aqueous solution water acts as the solvent due to the polarity of water molecules water can dissolve ionic compounds like sodium chloride by surrounding ions with a hydration shell separating them from each other nonionic polar molecules such as sugar can also dissolve in water through hydrogen bonding even large molecules like proteins dissolve in water if they have polar or ionic regions waters versatility as a solvent supports critical functions in biological fluids like blood and cellular environments
hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances any substance that has an affinity for water is said to be hydrophilic from the greek hydro water and philos loving in some cases substances can be hydrophilic without actually dissolving for example some molecules in cells are so large that they do not dissolve another example of a hydrophilic substance that does not dissolve is cotton a plant product cotton consists of giant molecules of cellulose a compound with numerous regions of partial positive and partial negative charges that can form hydrogen bonds with water water adheres to the cellulose fibers thus a cotton towel does a great job of drying the body yet it does not dissolve in the washing machine cellulose is also present in the walls of waterconducting cells in a plant you read earlier how the adhesion of water to these hydrophilic walls helps water move up the plant against gravity there are of course substances that do not have an affinity for water substances that are nonionic and nonpolar or otherwise cannot form hydrogen bonds actually seem to repel water these substances are said to be hydrophobic from the greek phobos fearing an example from the kitchen is vegetable oil which as you know does not mix stably with waterbased substances such as vinegar the hydrophobic behavior of the oil molecules results from a prevalence of relatively nonpolar covalent bonds in this case bonds between carbon and hydrogen which share electrons almost equally hydrophobic molecules related to oils are major ingredients of cell membranes imagine what would happen to a cell if its membrane dissolved solute concentration in aqueous solutions most of the chemical reactions in organisms involve solutes dissolved in water to understand such reactions we must know how many atoms and molecules are involved and calculate the concentration of solutes in an aqueous solution the number of solute molecules in a volume of solution when carrying out experiments we use mass to calculate the number of molecules we must first calculate the molecular mass which is the sum of the masses of all the atoms in a molecule as an example lets calculate the molecular mass of table sugar sucrose c12h22o11 in round numbers of daltons the mass of a carbon atom is 12 the mass of a hydrogen atom is 1 and the mass of an oxygen atom is 16 thus sucrose has a molecular mass of 12 12 22 1 11 16 342 daltons because we cant weigh out small numbers of molecules we usually measure substances in units called moles just as a dozen always means 12 objects a mole mol represents an exact number of objects 602 1023 which is called avogadros number because of the way in which avogadros number and the unit dalton were originally defined there are 602 1023 daltons in 1 g once we determine the molecular mass of a molecule such as sucrose we can use the same number 342 but with the unit gram to represent the mass of 602 1023 molecules of sucrose or 1 mol of sucrose this is sometimes called the molar mass to obtain 1 mol of sucrose in the lab therefore we weigh out 342 g the practical advantage of measuring a quantity of chemicals in moles is that a mole of one substance has exactly the same number of molecules as a mole of any other substance if the molecular mass of substance a is 342 daltons and that of substance b is 10 daltons then 342 g of a will have the same number of molecules as 10 g of b a mole of ethyl alcohol c2h6o also contains 602 1023 molecules but its mass is only 46 g because the mass of a molecule of ethyl alcohol is less than that of a molecule of sucrose measuring in moles makes it convenient for scientists working in the laboratory to combine substances in fixed ratios of molecules how would we make a liter l of solution consisting of 1 mol of sucrose dissolved in water we would measure out 342 g of sucrose and then gradually add water while stirring until the sugar was completely dissolved we would then add enough water to bring the total volume of the solution up to 1 l at that point we would have a 1molar 1 m solution of sucrose molaritythe number of moles of solute per liter of solutionis the unit of concentration most often used by biologists for aqueous solutions waters capacity as a versatile solvent complements the other properties discussed in this chapter since these remarkable properties allow water to support life on earth so well scientists who seek life elsewhere in the universe look for water as a sign that a planet might sustain life possible evolution of life on other planets e vo l u t i o n biologists who look for life elsewhere in the universe known as astrobiologists have concentrated their search on planets that might have water more than 800 planets have been found outside our solar system and there is evidence for the presence of water vapor on a few of them in our own solar system mars has been a focus of study like earth mars has an ice cap at both poles images from spacecraft sent to mars show that ice is present just under the surface of mars and enough water vapor exists in its atmosphere for frost to form figure 39 shows streaks that form along steep slopes during the mars spring and summer features that vanish during the winter some scientists have proposed that these are seasonal streams of flowing water occurring when subsurface ice melts during the warm season while others think they are the result of co2 rather than water drilling below the surface may be the next step in the search for signs of life on mars if any lifeforms or fossils are found their study will shed light on the process of evolution from an entirely new perspective,hydrophilic substances have an affinity for water and can form hydrogen bonds with it though they may not always dissolve such as cellulose in cotton hydrophobic substances like oils do not interact with water due to their nonpolar nature and are repelled by water the ability of molecules to dissolve in water depends on their polarity and ability to form hydrogen bonds additionally understanding solute concentration in aqueous solutions is essential for biological reactions molarity measures the concentration of solutes and the mole is a standard unit for counting molecules waters role as a solvent is crucial in supporting life on earth and is a key factor in the search for life on other planets like mars where the presence of water could indicate the potential for life
the chemical equilibrium between carbonic acid and bicarbonate acts as a ph regulator the reaction shifting left or right as other processes in the solution add or remove hydrogen ions if the h concentration in blood begins to fall that is if ph rises the reaction proceeds to the right and more carbonic acid dissociates replenishing hydrogen ions but when the h concentration in blood begins to rise when ph drops the reaction proceeds to the left with hco3 the base removing the hydrogen ions from the solution and forming h2co3 thus the carbonic acid bicarbonate buffering system consists of an acid and a base in equilibrium with each other most other buffers are also acidbase pairs,acids and bases affect living organisms by altering the balance of hydrogen ions h and hydroxide ions oh acids increase the h concentration in solutions while bases reduce it by accepting h or producing oh this balance is measured on the ph scale where lower values indicate more acidic solutions and higher values indicate more basic ones the ph of biological fluids is tightly regulated with most being around ph 68 except for stomach acid ph 2 organisms rely on buffers to maintain stable ph levels buffers such as the carbonic acidbicarbonate system resist changes in ph by either donating or absorbing h ions when necessary this is critical for processes in the body such as maintaining blood ph at around 74 as slight variations in ph can disrupt cellular functions key concepts acids increase h concentration bases reduce h concentration or increase oh ph scale measures acidity or basicity where 7 is neutral buffers substances that stabilize ph by absorbing or releasing h ions carbonic acidbicarbonate buffer key buffer in human blood maintains ph stability
acidification a threat to water quality among the many threats to water quality posed by human activities is the burning of fossil fuels which releases gaseous compounds into the atmosphere when certain of these compounds react with water the water becomes more acidic altering the delicate balance of conditions for life on earth carbon dioxide is the main product of fossil fuel combustion about 25 of humangenerated co2 is absorbed by the oceans in spite of the huge volume of water in the oceans scientists worry that the absorption of so much co2 will harm marine ecosystems recent data have shown that such fears are well founded when co2 dissolves in seawater it reacts with water to form carbonic acid which lowers ocean ph a process known as ocean acidification based on measurements of co2 levels in air bubbles trapped in ice over thousands of years scientists calculate that the ph of the oceans is 01 ph unit lower now than at any time in the past 420000 years recent studies predict that it will drop another 0305 ph unit by the end of this century as seawater acidifies the extra hydrogen ions combine with carbonate ions co32 to form bicarbonate ions hco3 thereby reducing the carbonate ion concentration figure 311 scientists predict that ocean acidification will cause the carbonate ion concentration to decrease by 40 by the year 2100 this is of great concern because carbonate ions are required for calcification the production of calcium carbonate caco3 by many marine organisms including reefbuilding corals and animals that build shells the scientific skills exercise allows you to work with data from an experiment examining the effect of carbonate ion concentration on coral reefs coral reefs are sensitive ecosystems that act as havens for a great diversity of marine life the disappearance of coral reef ecosystems would be a tragic loss of biological diversity if there is any reason for optimism about the future quality of water resources on our planet it is that we have made progress in learning about the delicate chemical balances in oceans lakes and rivers continued progress can come only from the actions of informed individuals like yourselves who are concerned about environmental quality this requires understanding the crucial role that water plays in the suitability of the environment for continued life on earth,human activities particularly fossil fuel burning are leading to ocean acidification as carbon dioxide co is absorbed by oceans and forms carbonic acid lowering the ph of seawater this acidification disrupts marine ecosystems by reducing carbonate ion co concentrations which are essential for marine organisms like corals and shellbuilding animals predictions suggest that ocean ph may drop by another 0305 units by 2100 reducing carbonate levels by 40 this threatens coral reefs crucial for marine biodiversity however understanding the chemical balance of water ecosystems can help inform actions to protect water quality key concepts ocean acidification lowering of ocean ph due to co absorption carbonate ions essential for calcium carbonate formation in marine organisms carbonic acid formed when co dissolves in seawater leading to acidification coral reefs sensitive ecosystems impacted by reduced carbonate ion levels water quality threatened by fossil fuel emissions requiring informed environmental action
carbon the backbone of life living organisms such as the plants and the qinling golden snubnosed mon keys shown in figure 41 are made up of chemicals based mostly on the element carbon carbon enters the biosphere through the action of plants and other photosynthetic organisms plants use solar energy to transform atmospheric co2 into the molecules of life which are then taken in by planteating animals of all the chemical elements carbon is unparalleled in its ability to form molecules that are large complex and varied making possible the diversity of organisms that have evolved on earth proteins dna carbohydrates and other molecules that distinguish living matter from inanimate material are all composed of carbon atoms bonded to one another and to atoms of other elements hydrogen h oxygen o nitrogen n sulfur s and phosphorus p are other common ingredients of these compounds but it is the element carbon c that accounts for the enormous variety of biological molecules large biological molecules such as proteins are the main focus of chapter 5 in this chapter we investigate the properties of smaller molecules we will use these small molecules to illustrate concepts of molecular architecture that will help explain why carbon is so important to life at the same time highlighting the theme that emergent properties arise from the organization of matter in living organisms organic chemistry is the study of carbon compounds for historical reasons compounds containing carbon are said to be organic and their study is called organic chemistry by the early 1800s chemists had learned to make simple compounds in the laboratory by combining elements under the right conditions artificial synthesis of the complex molecules extracted from living matter seemed impossible however organic compounds were thought to arise only in living organisms which were believed to contain a life force beyond the jurisdiction of physical and chemical laws chemists began to chip away at this notion when they learned to synthesize organic compounds in the laboratory in 1828 friedrich whler a german chemist tried to make an inorganic salt ammonium cyanate by mixing solutions of ammonium ions nh4 and cyanate ions cno whler was astonished to find that instead he had made urea an organic compound present in the urine of animals the next few decades saw laboratory synthesis of increasingly complex organic compounds supporting the view that physical and chemical laws govern the processes of life organic chemistry was redefined as the study of carbon compounds regardless of origin organic compounds range from simple molecules such as methane ch4 to colossal ones such as proteins with thousands of atoms organic molecules and the origin of life on earth e vo l u t i o n in 1953 stanley miller a graduate student of harold ureys at the university of chicago helped bring the abiotic nonliving synthesis of organic compounds into the context of evolution study figure 42 to learn about his classic experiment from his results miller concluded that complex organic molecules could arise spontaneously under conditions thought at that time to have existed on the early earth you can work with the data from a related experiment in the scientific skills exercise these experiments support the idea that abiotic synthesis of organic compounds perhaps near volcanoes could have been an early stage in the origin of life see chapter 25 the overall percentages of the major elements of life c h o n s and pare quite uniform from one organism to another reflecting the common evolutionary origin of all life because of carbons ability to form four bonds however this limited assortment of atomic building blocks can be used to build an inexhaustible variety of organic molecules different species of organisms and different individuals within a species are distinguished by variations in the types of organic molecules they make in a sense the great diversity of living organisms we see on the planet and in fossil remains is made possible by the unique chemical versatility of the element carbon,carbon is the fundamental element in all living organisms forming the backbone of lifes diversity it enters the biosphere through photosynthesis where plants convert atmospheric co into organic molecules carbons ability to form stable and diverse bonds with other elements including hydrogen oxygen nitrogen sulfur and phosphorus allows the formation of essential molecules like proteins dna and carbohydrates organic chemistry the study of carbon compounds has demonstrated that lifes complex molecules can be synthesized supporting the idea of abiotic origins of life stanley millers 1953 experiment reinforced the possibility that early earth conditions could have generated complex organic molecules vital for lifes evolution
carbon atoms can form diverse molecules by bonding to four other atoms the key to an atoms chemical characteristics is its electron configuration this configuration determines the kinds and number of bonds an atom will form with other atoms recall that it is the valence electrons those in the outermost shell that are available to form bonds with other atoms the formation of bonds with carbon carbon has 6 electrons with 2 in the first electron shell and 4 in the second shell thus it has 4 valence electrons in a shell that can hold up to 8 electrons a carbon atom usually completes its valence shell by sharing its 4 electrons with other atoms so that 8 electrons are present each pair of shared electrons constitutes a covalent bond see figure 210d in organic molecules carbon usually forms single or double covalent bonds each carbon atom acts as an intersection point from which a molecule can branch off in as many as four directions this enables carbon to form large complex molecules when a carbon atom forms four single covalent bonds the arrangement of its four hybrid orbitals causes the bonds to angle toward the corners of an imaginary tetrahedron the bond angles in methane ch4 are 1095 figure 43a and they are roughly the same in any group of atoms where carbon has four single bonds for example ethane c2h6 is shaped like two overlapping tetrahedrons figure 43b in molecules with more carbons every grouping of a carbon bonded to four other atoms has a tetrahedral shape but when two carbon atoms are joined by a double bond as in ethene c2h4 the bonds from both carbons are all in the same plane so the atoms joined to those carbons are in the same plane as well figure 43c we find it convenient to write molecules as structural formulas as if the molecules being represented are twodimensional but keep in mind that molecules are threedimensional and that the shape of a molecule is central to its function the electron configuration of carbon gives it covalent compatibility with many different elements figure 44 shows the valences of carbon and its most frequent bonding partnershydrogen oxygen and nitrogen these are the four major atomic components of organic molecules these valences are the basis for the rules of covalent bonding in organic chemistrythe building code for the architecture of organic molecules how do the rules of covalent bonding apply to carbon atoms with partners other than hydrogen well look at two examples the simple molecules carbon dioxide and urea in the carbon dioxide molecule co2 a single carbon atom is joined to two atoms of oxygen by double covalent bonds the structural formula for co2 is shown here o c o each line in a structural formula represents a pair of shared electrons thus the two double bonds in co2 have the same number of shared electrons as four single bonds the arrangement completes the valence shells of all atoms in the molecule because co2 is a very simple molecule and lacks hydrogen it is often considered inorganic even though it contains carbon whether we call co2 organic or inorganic however it is clearly important to the living world as the source of carbon for all organic molecules in organisms urea conh22 is the organic compound found in urine that whler synthesized in the early 1800s again each atom has the required number of covalent bonds in this case one carbon atom participates in both single and double bonds urea and carbon dioxide are molecules with only one carbon atom but as figure 43 shows a carbon atom can also use one or more valence electrons to form covalent bonds to other carbon atoms each of which can also form four bonds thus the atoms can be linked into chains of seemingly infinite variety,carbons ability to form four covalent bonds makes it incredibly versatile allowing the formation of large complex molecules essential for life carbon has four valence electrons and by sharing these electrons through covalent bonds it can bond with other atoms including hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen this versatility allows carbon to form single double or even complex branching structures giving rise to diverse molecular shapes like tetrahedral forms in methane ch and planar forms in ethene ch the molecular shape is crucial for the function of organic compounds carbon can bond with other carbon atoms to form chains of infinite variety which is the foundation of organic chemistry molecules like carbon dioxide co and urea conh demonstrate carbons ability to form stable compounds through single and double bonds critical for both organic and inorganic compounds
molecular diversity arising from variation in carbon skeletons carbon chains form the skeletons of most organic molecules the skeletons vary in length and may be straight branched or arranged in closed rings figure 45 some carbon skeletons have double bonds which vary in number and location such variation in carbon skeletons is one important source of the molecular complexity and diversity that characterize living matter in addition atoms of other elements can be bonded to the skeletons at available sites hydrocarbons all of the molecules that are shown in figures 43 and 45 are hydrocarbons organic molecules consisting of only carbon and hydrogen atoms of hydrogen are attached to the carbon skeleton wherever electrons are available for covalent bonding hydrocarbons are the major components of petroleum which is called a fossil fuel because it consists of the partially decomposed remains of organisms that lived millions of years ago although hydrocarbons are not prevalent in most living organisms many of a cells organic molecules have regions consisting of only carbon and hydrogen for example the molecules known as fats have long hydrocarbon tails attached to a nonhydrocarbon component figure 46 neither petroleum nor fat dissolves in water both are hydrophobic compounds because the great majority of their bonds are relatively nonpolar carbontohydrogen linkages another characteristic of hydrocarbons is that they can undergo reactions that release a relatively large amount of energy the gasoline that fuels a car consists of hydrocarbons and the hydrocarbon tails of fats serve as stored fuel for plant embryos seeds and animals isomers variation in the architecture of organic molecules can be seen in isomers compounds that have the same numbers of atoms of the same elements but different structures and hence different properties we will examine three types of isomers structural isomers cistrans isomers and enantiomers structural isomers differ in the covalent arrangements of their atoms compare for example the two fivecarbon compounds in figure 47a both have the molecular formula c5h12 but they differ in the covalent arrangement of their carbon skeletons the skeleton is straight in one compound but branched in the other the number of possible isomers increases tremendously as carbon skeletons increase in size there are only three forms of c5h12 two of which are shown in figure 47a but there are 18 variations of c8h18 and 366319 possible structural isomers of c20h42 structural isomers may also differ in the location of double bonds in cistrans isomers formerly called geometric isomers carbons have covalent bonds to the same atoms but these atoms differ in their spatial arrangements due to the inflexibility of double bonds single bonds allow the atoms they join to rotate freely about the bond axis without changing the compound in contrast double bonds do not permit such rotation if a double bond joins two carbon atoms and each c also has two different atoms or groups of atoms attached to it then two distinct cistrans isomers are possible consider a simple molecule with two doublebonded carbons each of which has an h and an x attached to it figure 47b the arrangement with both xs on the same side of the double bond is called a cis isomer and that with the xs on opposite sides is called a trans isomer the subtle difference in shape between such isomers can dramatically affect the biological activities of organic molecules for example the biochemistry of vision involves a lightinduced change of retinal a chemical compound in the eye from the cis isomer to the trans isomer see figure 5017 another example involves trans fats which are discussed in chapter 5 enantiomers are isomers that are mirror images of each other and that differ in shape due to the presence of an asymmetric carbon one that is attached to four different atoms or groups of atoms see the middle carbon in the ballandstick models shown in figure 47c the four groups can be arranged in space around the asymmetric carbon in two different ways that are mirror images enantiomers are in a way lefthanded and righthanded versions of the molecule just as your right hand wont fit into a lefthanded glove a righthanded molecule wont fit into the same space as the lefthanded version usually only one isomer is biologically active because only that form can bind to specific molecules in an organism the concept of enantiomers is important in the pharmaceutical industry because the two enantiomers of a drug may not be equally effective as is the case for both ibuprofen and the asthma medication albuterol figure 48 methamphetamine also occurs in two enantiomers that have very different effects one enantiomer is the highly addictive stimulant drug known as crank sold illegally in the street drug trade the other has a much weaker effect and is the active ingredient in an overthecounter vapor inhaler for treatment of nasal congestion the differing effects of enantiomers in the body demonstrate that organisms are sensitive to even the most subtle variations in molecular architecture once again we see that molecules have emergent properties that depend on the specific arrangement of their atoms a structural isomers structural isomers differ in covalent partners as shown in this example of two isomers of c5h12 b cistrans isomers cistrans isomers differ in arrangement about a double bond in these diagrams x represents an atom or group of atoms attached to a doublebonded carbon c enantiomers enantiomers differ in spatial arrangement around an asymmetric carbon resulting in molecules that are mirror images like left and right hands the two isomers here are designated the l and d isomers from the latin for left and right levo and dextro enantiomers cannot be superimposed on each other,carbon skeletons form the backbone of most organic molecules and can vary in length branching ring formation and the position of double bonds this variation contributes to the molecular diversity essential for life hydrocarbons made solely of carbon and hydrogen are nonpolar hydrophobic molecules that can store and release significant amounts of energy such as in fats and fuels like gasoline isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures and properties there are three types of isomers structural isomers differ in the arrangement of their carbon skeletons or the location of double bonds cistrans isomers occur due to the rigidity of double bonds in cis isomers groups are on the same side of the double bond while in trans isomers groups are on opposite sides enantiomers mirrorimage isomers with an asymmetric carbon only one enantiomer is usually biologically active because its shape fits specific biological molecules enantiomers are particularly significant in the pharmaceutical industry because different forms can have drastically different effects on the body for instance methamphetamine has two enantiomers one being a dangerous street drug and the other a mild overthecounter medication
a few chemical groups are key to molecular function the properties of an organic molecule depend not only on the arrangement of its carbon skeleton but also on the chemical groups attached to that skeleton we can think of hydrocarbons the simplest organic molecules as the underlying framework for more complex organic molecules a number of chemical groups can replace one or more hydrogens of the hydrocarbon these groups may participate in chemical reactions or may contribute to function indirectly by their effects on molecular shape they help give each molecule its unique properties the chemical groups most important in the processes of life consider the differences between estradiol a type of estrogen and testosterone these compounds are female and male sex hormones respectively in humans and other vertebrates both are steroids organic molecules with a common carbon skeleton in the form of four fused rings they differ only in the chemical groups attached to the rings shown here in abbreviated form the distinctions in molecular architecture are shaded in blue the different actions of these two molecules on many targets throughout the body are the basis of gender producing the contrasting features of male and female vertebrates in this case the chemical groups are important because they affect molecular shape contributing to function in other cases chemical groups are directly involved in chemical reactions such groups are known as functional groups each has certain properties such as shape and charge that cause it to participate in chemical reactions in a characteristic way the seven chemical groups most important in biological processes are the hydroxyl carbonyl carboxyl amino sulfhydryl phosphate and methyl groups the first six groups can be chemically reactive of these all except the sulfhydryl group are also hydrophilic and thus increase the solubility of organic compounds in water the methyl group is not reactive but instead often serves as a recognizable tag on biological molecules study figure 49 to become familiar with these biologically important chemical groups atp an important source of energy for cellular processes the phosphate group row in figure 49 shows a simple example of an organic phosphate molecule a more complicated organic phosphate adenosine triphosphate or atp is worth mentioning here because its function in the cell is so important atp consists of an organic molecule called adenosine attached to a string of three phosphate groups where three phosphates are present in series as in atp one phosphate may be split off as a result of a reaction with water this inorganic phosphate ion hopo32 is often abbreviated p i in this book and a phosphate group in an organic molecule is often written as p having lost one phosphate atp becomes adenosine diphosphate or adp although atp is sometimes said to store energy it is more accurate to think of it as storing the potential to react with water this reaction releases energy that can be used by the cell you will learn about this in more detail in chapter 8,the properties of organic molecules depend on their carbon skeletons and the chemical groups attached to them hydrocarbons the simplest organic molecules serve as frameworks for more complex structures chemical groups can either directly participate in reactions or influence molecular shape giving each molecule unique functions estradiol and testosterone which differ only in their chemical groups demonstrate how small changes can lead to significant biological differences such as male and female traits seven functional groups are critical in biological processes hydroxyl carbonyl carboxyl amino sulfhydryl phosphate and methyl most of these groups are reactive and hydrophilic enhancing solubility in water the methyl group though nonreactive often serves as a recognizable marker atp adenosine triphosphate a key molecule for cellular energy contains three phosphate groups when one phosphate is removed in a reaction with water atp becomes adp adenosine diphosphate releasing energy for cellular processes
the molecules of life given the rich complexity of life on earth it might surprise you that the most important large molecules found in all living thingsfrom bacteria to elephantscan be sorted into just four main classes carbohydrates lipids proteins and nucleic acids on the molecular scale members of three of these classescarbohydrates proteins and nucleic acidsare huge and are therefore called macromolecules for example a protein may consist of thousands of atoms that form a molecular colossus with a mass well over 100000 daltons considering the size and complexity of macromolecules it is noteworthy that biochemists have determined the detailed structure of so many of them the image in figure 51 is a molecular model of a protein called alcohol dehydrogenase which breaks down alcohol in the body the architecture of a large biological molecule plays an essential role in its function like water and simple organic molecules large biological molecules exhibit unique emergent properties arising from the orderly arrangement of their atoms in this chapter well first consider how macromolecules are built then well examine the structure and function of all four classes of large biological molecules carbohydrates lipids proteins and nucleic acids macromolecules are polymers built from monomers the macromolecules in three of the four classes of lifes organic compoundscarbohydrates proteins and nucleic acids all except lipidsare chainlike molecules called polymers from the greek polys many and meros part a polymer is a long molecule consisting of many similar or identical building blocks linked by covalent bonds much as a train consists of a chain of cars the repeating units that serve as the building blocks of a polymer are smaller molecules called monomers from the greek monos single some monomers also have other functions of their own the synthesis and breakdown of polymers although each class of polymer is made up of a different type of monomer the chemical mechanisms by which cells make and break down polymers are basically the same in all cases in cells these processes are facilitated by enzymes specialized macromolecules that speed up chemical reactions monomers are connected by a reaction in which two molecules are covalently bonded to each other with the loss of a water molecule this is known as a dehydration reaction figure 52a when a bond forms between two monomers each monomer contributes part of the water molecule that is released during the reaction one monomer provides a hydroxyl group oh while the other provides a hydrogen h this reaction is repeated as monomers are added to the chain one by one making a polymer polymers are disassembled to monomers by hydrolysis a process that is essentially the reverse of the dehydration reaction figure 52b hydrolysis means water breakage from the greek hydro water and lysis break the bond between monomers is broken by the addition of a water molecule with a hydrogen from water attaching to one monomer and the hydroxyl group attaching to the other an example of hydrolysis within our bodies is the process of digestion the bulk of the organic material in our food is in the form of polymers that are much too large to enter our cells within the digestive tract various enzymes attack the polymers speeding up hydrolysis released monomers are then absorbed into the bloodstream for distribution to all body cells those cells can then use dehydration reactions to assemble the monomers into new different polymers that can perform specific functions required by the cell the diversity of polymers a cell has thousands of different macromolecules the collection varies from one type of cell to another the inherited differences between close relatives such as human siblings reflect small variations in polymers particularly dna and proteins molecular differences between unrelated individuals are more extensive and those between species greater still the diversity of macromolecules in the living world is vast and the possible variety is effectively limitless what is the basis for such diversity in lifes polymers these molecules are constructed from only 40 to 50 common monomers and some others that occur rarely building a huge variety of polymers from such a limited number of monomers is analogous to constructing hundreds of thousands of words from only 26 letters of the alphabet the key is arrangementthe particular linear sequence that the units follow however this analogy falls far short of describing the great diversity of macromolecules because most biological polymers have many more monomers than the number of letters a word even the longest ones proteins for example are built from 20 kinds of amino acids arranged in chains that are typically hundreds of amino acids long the molecular logic of life is simple but elegant small molecules common to all organisms are ordered into unique macromolecules despite this immense diversity molecular structure and function can still be grouped roughly by class lets examine each of the four major classes of large biological molecules for each class the large molecules have emergent properties not found in their individual building blocks,life on earth consists of complex organisms that rely on four main classes of large biological molecules carbohydrates lipids proteins and nucleic acids three of these classescarbohydrates proteins and nucleic acidsare macromolecules and are constructed as polymers from smaller units called monomers the processes of building and breaking down these polymers involve enzymes and include two key reactions dehydration synthesis joining monomers while releasing water and hydrolysis breaking down polymers by adding water the diversity of polymers arises from a limited set of about 40 to 50 common monomers yet the specific arrangement of these monomers allows for a virtually limitless variety of macromolecules for instance proteins are formed from 20 different amino acids and can have chains that are hundreds of amino acids long despite their diversity macromolecules exhibit unique emergent properties that are not found in their individual components highlighting the intricate molecular logic of life
carbohydrates serve as fuel and building material carbohydrates include sugars and polymers of sugars the simplest carbohydrates are the monosaccharides or simple sugars these are the monomers from which more complex carbohydrates are built disaccharides are double sugars consisting of two monosaccharides joined by a covalent bond carbohydrate macromolecules are polymers called polysaccharides composed of many sugar building blocks sugars monosaccharides from the greek monos single and sacchar sugar generally have molecular formulas that are some multiple of the unit ch2o glucose c6h12o6 the most common monosaccharide is of central importance in the chemistry of life in the structure of glucose we can see the trademarks of a sugar the molecule has a carbonyl group co and multiple hydroxyl groups oh figure 53 depending on the location of the carbonyl group a sugar is either an aldose aldehyde sugar or a ketose ketone sugar glucose for example is an aldose fructose an isomer of glucose is a ketose most names for sugars end in ose another criterion for classifying sugars is the size of the carbon skeleton which ranges from three to seven carbons long glucose fructose and other sugars that have six carbons are called hexoses trioses threecarbon sugars and pentoses fivecarbon sugars are also common still another source of diversity for simple sugars is in the spatial arrangement of their parts around asymmetric carbons recall that an asymmetric carbon is a carbon attached to four different atoms or groups of atoms glucose and galactose for example differ only in the placement of parts around one asymmetric carbon see the purple boxes in figure 53 what seems like a small difference is significant enough to give the two sugars distinctive shapes and binding activities thus different behaviors although it is convenient to draw glucose with a linear carbon skeleton this representation is not completely accurate in aqueous solutions glucose molecules as well as most other five and sixcarbon sugars form rings figure 54 monosaccharides particularly glucose are major nutrients for cells in the process known as cellular respiration cells extract energy from glucose molecules by breaking them down in a series of reactions not only are simplesugar molecules a major fuel for cellular work but their carbon skeletons also serve as raw material for the synthesis of other types of small organic molecules such as amino acids and fatty acids sugar molecules that are not immediately used in these ways are generally incorporated as monomers into disaccharides or polysaccharides a disaccharide consists of two monosaccharides joined by a glycosidic linkage a covalent bond formed between two monosaccharides by a dehydration reaction for example maltose is a disaccharide formed by the linking of two molecules of glucose figure 55a also known as malt sugar maltose is an ingredient used in brewing beer the most prevalent disaccharide is sucrose which is table sugar its two monomers are glucose and fructose figure 55b plants generally transport carbohydrates from leaves to roots and other nonphotosynthetic organs in the form of sucrose lactose the sugar present in milk is another disaccharide in this case a glucose molecule joined to a galactose molecule a dehydration reaction in the synthesis of maltose the bonding of two glucose units forms maltose the 14 glycosidic linkage joins the number 1 carbon of one glucose to the number 4 carbon of the second glucose joining the glucose monomers in a different way would result in a different disaccharide b dehydration reaction in the synthesis of sucrose sucrose is a disaccharide formed from glucose and fructose notice that fructose forms a fivesided ring though it is a hexose like glucose,carbohydrates are essential biomolecules that include sugars and their polymers they serve both as energy sources and structural materials for living organisms the simplest form of carbohydrates is monosaccharides which are single sugar molecules common monosaccharides include glucose cho an aldose sugar and fructose a ketose sugar these sugars can vary based on the size of their carbon skeleton ranging from three to seven carbons and the spatial arrangement around asymmetric carbons leading to variations in shape and function when two monosaccharides bond through a glycosidic linkagea covalent bond formed via a dehydration reactionthey create disaccharides examples include maltose two glucose molecules and sucrose glucose and fructose sucrose is widely used by plants to transport carbohydrates while lactose glucose and galactose is the sugar found in milk monosaccharides not immediately used for energy can serve as building blocks for more complex carbohydrates including polysaccharides which consist of many sugar units linked together
polysaccharides polysaccharides are macromolecules polymers with a few hundred to a few thousand monosaccharides joined by glycosidic linkages some polysaccharides serve as storage material hydrolyzed as needed to provide sugar for cells other polysaccharides serve as building material for structures that protect the cell or the whole organism the architecture and function of a polysaccharide are determined by its sugar monomers and by the positions of its glycosidic linkages storage polysaccharides both plants and animals store sugars for later use in the form of storage polysaccharides figure 56 plants store starch a polymer of glucose monomers as granules within cellular structures known as plastids which include chloroplasts synthesizing starch enables the plant to stockpile surplus glucose because glucose is a major cellular fuel starch represents stored energy the sugar can later be withdrawn from this carbohydrate bank by hydrolysis which breaks the bonds between the glucose monomers most animals including humans also have enzymes that can hydrolyze plant starch making glucose available as a nutrient for cells potato tubers and grains are the major sources of starch in the human diet most of the glucose monomers in starch are joined by 14 linkages number 1 carbon to number 4 carbon like the glucose units in maltose see figure 55a the simplest form of starch amylose is unbranched amylopectin a more complex starch is a branched polymer with 16 linkages at the branch points both of these starches are shown in figure 56a animals store a polysaccharide called glycogen a polymer of glucose that is like amylopectin but more extensively branched figure 56b vertebrates store glycogen mainly in liver and muscle cells hydrolysis of glycogen in these cells releases glucose when the demand for sugar increases this stored fuel cannot sustain an animal for long however in humans for example glycogen stores are depleted in about a day unless they are replenished by consumption of food this is an issue of concern in lowcarbohydrate diets which can result in weakness and fatigue structural polysaccharides organisms build strong materials from structural polysaccharides for example the polysaccharide called cellulose is a major component of the tough walls that enclose plant cells figure 56c on a global scale plants produce almost 1014 kg 100 billion tons of cellulose per year it is the most abundant organic compound on earth like starch cellulose is a polymer of glucose but the glycosidic linkages in these two polymers differ the difference is based on the fact that there are actually two slightly different ring structures for glucose figure 57a when glucose forms a ring the hydroxyl group attached to the number 1 carbon is positioned either below or above the plane of the ring these two ring forms for glucose are called alpha and beta respectively greek letters are often used as a numbering system for different versions of biological structures much as we use the letters a b c and so on for the parts of a question or a figure in starch all the glucose monomers are in the configuration figure 57b the arrangement we saw in figures 54 and 55 in contrast the glucose monomers of cellulose are all in the configuration making every glucose monomer upside down with respect to its neighbors figure 57c see also figure 56c the differing glycosidic linkages in starch and cellulose give the two molecules distinct threedimensional shapes whereas certain starch molecules are largely helical a cellulose molecule is straight cellulose is never branched and some hydroxyl groups on its glucose monomers are free to hydrogenbond with the hydroxyls of other cellulose molecules lying parallel to it in plant cell walls parallel cellulose molecules held together in this way are grouped into units called microfibrils see figure 56c these cablelike microfibrils are a strong building material for plants and an important substance for humans because cellulose is the major constituent of paper and the only component of cotton enzymes that digest starch by hydrolyzing its linkages are unable to hydrolyze the linkages of cellulose due to the different shapes of these two molecules in fact few organisms possess enzymes that can digest cellulose almost all animals including humans do not the cellulose in our food passes through the digestive tract and is eliminated with the feces along the way the cellulose abrades the wall of the digestive tract and stimulates the lining to secrete mucus which aids in the smooth passage of food through the tract thus although cellulose is not a nutrient for humans it is an important part of a healthful diet most fruits vegetables and whole grains are rich in cellulose on food packages insoluble fiber refers mainly to cellulose some microorganisms can digest cellulose breaking it down into glucose monomers a cow harbors cellulosedigesting prokaryotes and protists in its gut these microbes hydrolyze the cellulose of hay and grass and convert the glucose to other compounds that nourish the cow similarly a termite which is unable to digest cellulose by itself has prokaryotes or protists living in its gut that can make a meal of wood some fungi can also digest cellulose in soil and elsewhere thereby helping recycle chemical elements within earths ecosystems another important structural polysaccharide is chitin the carbohydrate used by arthropods insects spiders crustaceans and related animals to build their exoskeletons figure 58 an exoskeleton is a hard case that surrounds the soft parts of an animal made up of chitin embedded in a layer of proteins the case is leathery and flexible at first but becomes hardened when the proteins are chemically linked to each other as in insects or encrusted with calcium carbonate as in crabs chitin is also found in fungi which use this polysaccharide rather than cellulose as the building material for their cell walls chitin is similar to cellulose with linkages except that the glucose monomer of chitin has a nitrogencontaining appendage see figure 58 top right,polysaccharides are large macromolecules formed from hundreds to thousands of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic linkages they can serve various functions primarily as storage materials or structural components storage polysaccharides starch the primary storage polysaccharide in plants consisting of glucose monomers it is stored in plastids and can be broken down via hydrolysis to release glucose for cellular energy starch can exist in two forms amylose unbranched glucose chains amylopectin branched chains with 16 linkages glycogen the storage polysaccharide in animals similar to amylopectin but more branched it is primarily stored in liver and muscle cells and provides glucose quickly when needed structural polysaccharides cellulose a major component of plant cell walls made up of glucose monomers its unique configuration leads to straight chains that can hydrogen bond with neighboring cellulose molecules forming microfibrils for structural integrity unlike starch cellulose is indigestible by most animals making it a significant source of dietary fiber chitin found in the exoskeletons of arthropods and in the cell walls of fungi it is similar to cellulose but contains a nitrogenous group providing strength and flexibility both cellulose and chitin serve as essential structural materials in various organisms and contribute to ecological recycling by being digestible by certain microbes
lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic molecules lipids are the one class of large biological molecules that does not include true polymers and they are generally not big enough to be considered macromolecules the compounds called lipids are grouped with each other because they share one important trait they mix poorly if at all with water the hydrophobic behavior of lipids is based on their molecular structure although they may have some polar bonds associated with oxygen lipids consist mostly of hydrocarbon regions lipids are varied in form and function they include waxes and certain pigments but we will focus on the types of lipids that are most biologically important fats phospholipids and steroids fats although fats are not polymers they are large molecules assembled from smaller molecules by dehydration reactions a fat is constructed from two kinds of smaller molecules glycerol and fatty acids figure 59a glycerol is an alcohol each of its three carbons bears a hydroxyl group a fatty acid has a long carbon skeleton usually 16 or 18 carbon atoms in length the carbon at one end of the skeleton is part of a carboxyl group the functional group that gives these molecules the name fatty acid the rest of the skeleton consists of a hydrocarbon chain the relatively nonpolar ch bonds in the hydrocarbon chains of fatty acids are the reason fats are hydrophobic fats separate from water because the water molecules hydrogenbond to one another and exclude the fats this is the reason that vegetable oil a liquid fat separates from the aqueous vinegar solution in a bottle of salad dressing in making a fat three fatty acid molecules are each joined to glycerol by an ester linkage a bond formed by a dehydration reaction between a hydroxyl group and a carboxyl group the resulting fat also called a triacylglycerol thus consists of three fatty acids linked to one glycerol molecule still another name for a fat is triglyceride a word often found in the list of ingredients on packaged foods the fatty acids in a fat can all be the same or they can be of two or three different kinds as in figure 59b the terms saturated fats and unsaturated fats are commonly used in the context of nutrition figure 510 these terms refer to the structure of the hydrocarbon chains of the fatty acids if there are no double bonds between carbon atoms composing a chain then as many hydrogen atoms as possible are bonded to the carbon skeleton such a structure is said to be saturated with hydrogen and the resulting fatty acid is therefore called a saturated fatty acid figure 510a an unsaturated fatty acid has one or more double bonds with one fewer hydrogen atom on each doublebonded carbon nearly all double bonds in naturally occurring fatty acids are cis double bonds which cause a kink in the hydrocarbon chain wherever they occur figure 510b see figure 47b to remind yourself about cis and trans double bonds a fat made from saturated fatty acids is called a saturated fat most animal fats are saturated the hydrocarbon chains of their fatty acidsthe tails of the fat moleculeslack double bonds and their flexibility allows the fat molecules to pack together tightly saturated animal fatssuch as lard and butterare solid at room temperature in contrast the fats of plants and fishes are generally unsaturated meaning that they are built of one or more types of unsaturated fatty acids usually liquid at room temperature plant and fish fats are referred to as oilsolive oil and cod liver oil are examples the kinks where the cis double bonds are located prevent the molecules from packing together closely enough to solidify at room temperature the phrase hydrogenated vegetable oils on food labels means that unsaturated fats have been synthetically converted to saturated fats by adding hydrogen peanut butter margarine and many other products are hydrogenated to prevent lipids from separating out in liquid oil form a diet rich in saturated fats is one of several factors that may contribute to the cardiovascular disease known as atherosclerosis in this condition deposits called plaques develop within the walls of blood vessels causing inward bulges that impede blood flow and reduce the resilience of the vessels recent studies have shown that the process of hydrogenating vegetable oils produces not only saturated fats but also unsaturated fats with trans double bonds these trans fats may contribute more than saturated fats to atherosclerosis see chapter 42 and other problems because trans fats are especially common in baked goods and processed foods the us department of agriculture requires nutritional labels to include information on trans fat content some us cities and at least two countriesdenmark and switzerlandhave even banned the use of trans fats in restaurants the major function of fats is energy storage the hydrocarbon chains of fats are similar to gasoline molecules and just as rich in energy a gram of fat stores more than twice as much energy as a gram of a polysaccharide such as starch because plants are relatively immobile they can function with bulky energy storage in the form of starch vegetable oils are generally obtained from seeds where more compact storage is an asset to the plant animals however must carry their energy stores with them so there is an advantage to having a more compact reservoir of fuelfat humans and other mammals stock their longterm food reserves in adipose cells see figure 46a which swell and shrink as fat is deposited and withdrawn from storage in addition to storing energy adipose tissue also cushions such vital organs as the kidneys and a layer of fat beneath the skin insulates the body this subcutaneous layer is especially thick in whales seals and most other marine mammals protecting them from cold ocean water,lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic molecules essential for biological functions and they do not form true polymers or macromolecules their key characteristic is poor solubility in water due to their predominantly hydrocarbon structure the main types of lipids include fats phospholipids and steroids with fats being particularly significant for energy storage fats consist of glycerol and fatty acids linked by ester linkages through dehydration reactions forming triacylglycerols fatty acids can be saturated containing no double bonds and typically solid at room temperature eg lard butter or unsaturated with one or more double bonds making them liquid eg olive oil unsaturated fats can undergo hydrogenation transforming them into saturated fats and potentially producing trans fats which are linked to health issues like atherosclerosis the primary function of fats is energy storage providing more than twice the energy of carbohydrates per gram they also cushion vital organs and insulate the body particularly in marine mammals understanding the structure and function of lipids is crucial for appreciating their roles in nutrition and overall health
phospholipids cells as we know them could not exist without another type of lipidphospholipids phospholipids are essential for cells because they are major constituents of cell membranes their structure provides a classic example of how form fits function at the molecular level as shown in figure 511 a phospholipid is similar to a fat molecule but has only two fatty acids attached to glycerol rather than three the third hydroxyl group of glycerol is joined to a phosphate group which has a negative electrical charge in the cell typically an additional small charged or polar molecule is also linked to the phosphate group choline is one such molecule see figure 511 but there are many others as well allowing formation of a variety of phospholipids that differ from each other the two ends of phospholipids show different behavior toward water the hydrocarbon tails are hydrophobic and are excluded from water however the phosphate group and its attachments form a hydrophilic head that has an affinity for water when phospholipids are added to water they selfassemble into doublelayered structures called bilayers shielding their hydrophobic portions from water figure 511d at the surface of a cell phospholipids are arranged in a similar bilayer the hydrophilic heads of the molecules are on the outside of the bilayer in contact with the aqueous solutions inside and outside of the cell the hydrophobic tails point toward the interior of the bilayer away from the water the phospholipid bilayer forms a boundary between the cell and its external environment in fact the existence of cells depends on the properties of phospholipids steroids steroids are lipids characterized by a carbon skeleton consisting of four fused rings different steroids are distinguished by the particular chemical groups attached to this ensemble of rings cholesterol a type of steroid is a crucial molecule in animals figure 512 it is a common component of animal cell membranes and is also the precursor from which other steroids such as the vertebrate sex hormones are synthesized in vertebrates cholesterol is synthesized in the liver and is also obtained from the diet a high level of cholesterol in the blood may contribute to atherosclerosis in fact both saturated fats and trans fats exert their negative impact on health by affecting cholesterol levels,phospholipids are essential lipids that form the structural basis of cell membranes comprising two fatty acids glycerol and a phosphate group their unique structure allows for a hydrophilic waterattracting head and hydrophobic waterrepelling tails when exposed to water phospholipids spontaneously arrange into bilayers with hydrophilic heads facing outward and hydrophobic tails inward creating a protective barrier around the cell this arrangement is crucial for maintaining the cells integrity and regulating the movement of substances in and out steroids are another class of lipids with a structure consisting of four fused carbon rings cholesterol is a key steroid in animals playing vital roles in cell membranes and serving as a precursor for other steroids including sex hormones cholesterol is synthesized in the liver and absorbed from the diet however elevated blood cholesterol levels can lead to health issues such as atherosclerosis particularly influenced by the intake of saturated and trans fats
proteins include a diversity of structures resulting in a wide range of functions nearly every dynamic function of a living being depends on proteins in fact the importance of proteins is underscored by their name which comes from the greek word proteios meaning first or primary proteins account for more than 50 of the dry mass of most cells and they are instrumental in almost everything organisms do some proteins speed up chemical reactions while others play a role in defense storage transport cellular communication movement or structural support figure 513 shows examples of proteins with these functions which youll learn more about in later chapters life would not be possible without enzymes most of which are proteins enzymatic proteins regulate metabolism by acting as catalysts chemical agents that selectively speed up chemical reactions without being consumed by the reaction because an enzyme can perform its function over and over again these molecules can be thought of as workhorses that keep cells running by carrying out the processes of life a human has tens of thousands of different proteins each with a specific structure and function proteins in fact are the most structurally sophisticated molecules known consistent with their diverse functions they vary extensively in structure each type of protein having a unique three dimensional shape diverse as proteins are they are all constructed from the same set of 20 amino acids linked in unbranched polymers the bond between amino acids is called a peptide bond so a polymer of amino acids is called a polypeptide a protein is a biologically functional molecule made up of one or more polypeptides each folded and coiled into a specific three dimensional structure amino acid monomers all amino acids share a common structure an amino acid is an organic molecule with both an amino group and a carboxyl group see figure 49 the figure at the right shows the general formula for an amino acid at the center of the amino acid is an asymmetric carbon atom called the alpha carbon its four different partners are an amino group a carboxyl group a hydrogen atom and a variable group symbolized by r the r group also called the side chain differs with each amino acid figure 514 shows the 20 amino acids that cells use to build their thousands of proteins here the amino groups and carboxyl groups are all depicted in ionized form the way they usually exist at the ph found in a cell the physical and chemical properties of the side chain determine the unique characteristics of a particular amino acid thus affecting its functional role in a polypeptide in figure 514 the amino acids are grouped according to the properties of their side chains one group consists of amino acids with nonpolar side chains which are hydrophobic figure 514 shows the 20 amino acids that cells use to build their thousands of proteins here the amino groups and carboxyl groups are all depicted in ionized form the way they usually exist at the ph found in a cell the physical and chemical properties of the side chain determine the unique characteristics of a particular amino acid thus affecting its functional role in a polypeptide in figure 514 the amino acids are grouped according to the properties of their side chains one group consists of amino acids with nonpolar side chains which are hydrophobic polypeptides amino acid polymers now that we have examined amino acids lets see how they are linked to form polymers figure 515 when two amino acids are positioned so that the carboxyl group of one is adjacent to the amino group of the other they can become joined by a dehydration reaction with the removal of a water molecule the resulting covalent bond is called a peptide bond repeated over and over this process yields a polypeptide a polymer of many amino acids linked by peptide bonds the repeating sequence of atoms highlighted in purple in figure 515 is called the polypeptide backbone extending from this backbone are the different side chains r groups of the amino acids polypeptides range in length from a few amino acids to a thousand or more each specific polypeptide has a unique linear sequence of amino acids note that one end of the polypeptide chain has a free amino group while the opposite end has a free carboxyl group thus a polypeptide of any length has a single amino end nterminus and a single carboxyl end cterminus in a polypeptide of any significant size the side chains far outnumber the terminal groups so the chemical nature of the molecule as a whole is determined by the kind and sequence of the side chains the immense variety of polypeptides in nature illustrates an important concept introduced earlierthat cells can make many different polymers by linking a limited set of monomers into diverse sequences protein structure and function the specific activities of proteins result from their intricate threedimensional architecture the simplest level of which is the sequence of their amino acids the pioneer in determining the amino acid sequence of proteins was frederick sanger who with his colleagues at cambridge university in england worked on the hormone insulin in the late 1940s and early 1950s he used agents that break polypeptides at specific places followed by chemical methods to determine the amino acid sequence in these small fragments sanger and his coworkers were able after years of effort to reconstruct the complete amino acid sequence of insulin since then the steps involved in sequencing a polypeptide have been automated once we have learned the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide what can it tell us about the threedimensional structure commonly referred to simply as the structure of the protein and its function the term polypeptide is not synonymous with the term protein even for a protein consisting of a single polypeptide the relationship is somewhat analogous to that between a long strand of yarn and a sweater of particular size and shape that can be knit from the yarn a functional protein is not just a polypeptide chain but one or more polypeptides precisely twisted folded and coiled into a molecule of unique shape which can be shown in several different types of models figure 516 and it is the amino acid sequence of each polypeptide that determines what threedimensional structure the protein will have under normal cellular conditions when a cell synthesizes a polypeptide the chain may fold spontaneously assuming the functional structure for that protein this folding is driven and reinforced by the formation of various bonds between parts of the chain which in turn depends on the sequence of amino acids many proteins are roughly spherical globular proteins while others are shaped like long fibers fibrous proteins even within these broad categories countless variations exist a proteins specific structure determines how it works in almost every case the function of a protein depends on its ability to recognize and bind to some other molecule in an especially striking example of the marriage of form and function figure 517 shows the exact match of shape between an antibody a protein in the body and the particular foreign substance on a flu virus that the antibody binds to and marks for destruction in chapter 43 youll learn more about how the immune system generates antibodies that match the shapes of specific foreign molecules so well also you may recall from chapter 2 that natural signaling molecules called endorphins bind to specific receptor proteins on the surface of brain cells in humans producing euphoria and relieving pain morphine heroin and other opiate drugs are able to mimic endorphins because they all share a similar shape with endorphins and can thus fit into and bind to endorphin receptors in the brain this fit is very specific something like a lock and key see figure 216 thus the function of a proteinfor instance the ability of a receptor protein to bind to a particular painrelieving signaling moleculeis an emergent property resulting from exquisite molecular order,proteins are vital macromolecules that play numerous roles in living organisms comprising over 50 of cellular dry mass they are involved in processes such as metabolism via enzymes defense transport communication movement and structural support proteins are constructed from 20 different amino acids linked by peptide bonds to form polypeptides which have unique sequences that determine their threedimensional structures and functions the basic structure of an amino acid includes an amino group a carboxyl group and a variable side chain r group the specific characteristics of these side chains influence a proteins properties and functions polypeptides can vary greatly in length and sequence resulting in immense diversity among proteins protein structure consists of four levels primary amino acid sequence secondary alpha helices and beta sheets tertiary overall 3d shape and quaternary assembly of multiple polypeptide chains the specific shape of a protein enables it to perform its function such as binding to other molecules which is crucial for processes like signaling and immune response
four levels of protein structure with the goal of understanding the function of a protein learning about its structure is often productive in spite of their great diversity all proteins share three superimposed levels of structure known as primary secondary and tertiary structure a fourth level quaternary structure arises when a protein consists of two or more polypeptide chains figure 518 describes these four levels of protein structure be sure to study this figure thoroughly before going on to the next section the primary structure of a protein is its sequence of amino acids as an example lets consider transthyretin a globular blood protein that transports vitamin a and one of the thyroid hormones throughout the body transthyretin is made up of four identical polypeptide chains each composed of 127 amino acids shown here is one of these chains unraveled for a closer look at its primary structure each of the 127 positions along the chain is occupied by one of the 20 amino acids indicated here by its threeletter abbreviation the primary structure is like the order of letters in a very long word if left to chance there would be 20127 different ways of making a polypeptide chain 127 amino acids long however the precise primary structure of a protein is determined not by the random linking of amino acids but by inherited genetic information the primary structure in turn dictates secondary and tertiary structure due to the chemical nature of the backbone and the side chains r groups of the amino acids along the polypeptide most proteins have segments of their polypeptide chains repeatedly coiled or folded in patterns that contribute to the proteins overall shape these coils and folds collectively referred to as secondary structure are the result of hydrogen bonds between the repeating constituents of the polypeptide backbone not the amino acid side chains within the backbone the oxygen atoms have a partial negative charge and the hydrogen atoms attached to the nitrogens have a partial positive charge see figure 214 therefore hydrogen bonds can form between these atoms individually these hydrogen bonds are weak but because there are so many of them over a relatively long region of the polypeptide chain they can support a particular shape for that part of the protein one such secondary structure is the helix a delicate coil held together by hydrogen bonding between every fourth amino acid as shown above although each transthyretin polypeptide has only one helix region see tertiary structure other globular proteins have multiple stretches of helix separated by nonhelical regions see hemoglobin on the next page some fibrous proteins such as keratin the structural protein of hair have the helix structure over most of their length the other main type of secondary structure is the pleated sheet as shown above in this structure two or more segments of the polypeptide chain lying side by side called strands are connected by hydrogen bonds between parts of the two parallel segments of the polypeptide backbone pleated sheets make up the core of many globular proteins as is the case for transthyretin see tertiary structure and dominate some fibrous proteins including the silk protein of a spiders web the teamwork of so many hydrogen bonds makes each spider silk fiber stronger than a steel strand of the same weight superimposed on the patterns of secondary structure is a proteins tertiary structure shown above in a ribbon model of the transthyretin polypeptide while secondary structure involves interactions between backbone constituents tertiary structure is the overall shape of a polypeptide resulting from interactions between the side chains r groups of the various amino acids one type of interaction that contributes to tertiary structure is calledsomewhat misleadingly a hydrophobic interaction as a polypeptide folds into its functional shape amino acids with hydrophobic nonpolar side chains usually end up in clusters at the core of the protein out of contact with water thus a hydrophobic interaction is actually caused by the exclusion of nonpolar substances by water molecules once nonpolar amino acid side chains are close together van der waals interactions help hold them together meanwhile hydrogen bonds between polar side chains and ionic bonds between positively and negatively charged side chains also help stabilize tertiary structure these are all weak interactions in the aqueous cellular environment but their cumulative effect helps give the protein a unique shape covalent bonds called disulfide bridges may further reinforce the shape of a protein disulfide bridges form where two cysteine monomers which have sulfhydryl groups sh on their side chains see figure 49 are brought close together by the folding of the protein the sulfur of one cysteine bonds to the sulfur of the second and the disulfide bridge ss rivets parts of the protein together see the yellow lines in figure 516a all of these different kinds of interactions can contribute to the tertiary structure of a protein as shown here in a small part of a hypothetical protein quaternary structure some proteins consist of two or more polypeptide chains aggregated into one functional macromolecule quaternary structure is the overall protein structure that results from the aggregation of these polypeptide subunits for example shown above is the complete globular transthyretin protein made up of its four polypeptides another example is collagen shown below which is a fibrous protein that has three identical helical polypeptides intertwined into a larger triple helix giving the long fibers great strength this suits collagen fibers to their function as the girders of connective tissue in skin bone tendons ligaments and other body parts collagen accounts for 40 of the protein in a human body collagen hemoglobin the oxygenbinding protein of red blood cells shown below is another example of a globular protein with quaternary structure it consists of four polypeptide subunits two of one kind and two of another kind both and subunits consist primarily of helical secondary structure each subunit has a nonpolypeptide component called heme with an iron atom that binds oxygen sicklecell disease a change in primary structure even a slight change in primary structure can affect a proteins shape and ability to function for instance sicklecell disease an inherited blood disorder is caused by the substitution of one amino acid valine for the normal one glutamic acid at a particular position in the primary structure of hemoglobin the protein that carries oxygen in red blood cells normal red blood cells are diskshaped but in sicklecell disease the abnormal hemoglobin molecules tend to aggregate into chains deforming some of the cells into a sickle shape figure 519 a person with the disease has periodic sicklecell crises when the angular cells clog tiny blood vessels impeding blood flow the toll taken on such patients is a dramatic example of how a simple change in protein structure can have devastating effects on protein function,proteins exhibit four levels of structure primary secondary tertiary and quaternary each critical for their function primary structure this is the specific sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain determined by genetic information for example transthyretin consists of four identical polypeptide chains each with 127 amino acids secondary structure this refers to local folded structures within the polypeptide primarily stabilized by hydrogen bonds two common types are the helix a coiled structure and the pleated sheet formed by hydrogen bonds between adjacent strands tertiary structure this is the overall threedimensional shape of a polypeptide shaped by interactions between side chains r groups hydrophobic interactions van der waals forces hydrogen bonds ionic bonds and disulfide bridges all contribute to this structure quaternary structure some proteins consist of multiple polypeptide chains forming a functional macromolecule examples include collagen a fibrous protein with a triple helix structure and hemoglobin composed of four polypeptide subunits that bind oxygen a change in primary structure can significantly impact a proteins function as illustrated by sicklecell disease which results from a single amino acid substitution in hemoglobin leading to abnormal cell shapes and impaired blood flow
what determines protein structure youve learned that a unique shape endows each protein with a specific function but what are the key factors determining protein structure you already know most of the answer a polypeptide chain of a given amino acid sequence can be arranged into a threedimensional shape determined by the interactions responsible for secondary and tertiary structure this folding normally occurs as the protein is being synthesized in the crowded environment within a cell aided by other proteins however protein structure also depends on the physical and chemical conditions of the proteins environment if the ph salt concentration temperature or other aspects of its environment are altered the weak chemical bonds and interactions within a protein may be destroyed causing the protein to unravel and lose its native shape a change called denaturation figure 520 because it is misshapen the denatured protein is biologically inactive most proteins become denatured if they are transferred from an aqueous environment to a nonpolar solvent such as ether or chloroform the polypeptide chain refolds so that its hydrophobic regions face outward toward the solvent other denaturation agents include chemicals that disrupt the hydrogen bonds ionic bonds and disulfide bridges that maintain a proteins shape denaturation can also result from excessive heat which agitates the polypeptide chain enough to overpower the weak interactions that stabilize the structure the white of an egg becomes opaque during cooking because the denatured proteins are insoluble and solidify this also explains why excessively high fevers can be fatal proteins in the blood tend to denature at very high body temperatures when a protein in a testtube solution has been denatured by heat or chemicals it can sometimes return to its functional shape when the denaturing agent is removed sometimes this is not possible for example a fried egg will not become liquefied when placed back into the refrigerator we can conclude that the information for building specific shape is intrinsic to the proteins primary structure the sequence of amino acids determines the proteins shapewhere an helix can form where pleated sheets can exist where disulfide bridges are located where ionic bonds can form and so on but how does protein folding occur in the cell protein folding in the cell biochemists now know the amino acid sequence for more than 24 million proteins with about 1 million added each month and the threedimensional shape for more than 25000 researchers have tried to correlate the primary structure of many proteins with their threedimensional structure to discover the rules of protein folding unfortunately however the proteinfolding process is not that simple most proteins probably go through several intermediate structures on their way to a stable shape and looking at the mature structure does not reveal the stages of folding required to achieve that form however biochemists have developed methods for tracking a protein through such stages crucial to the folding process are chaperonins also called chaperone proteins protein molecules that assist in the proper folding of other proteins figure 521 chaperonins do not specify the final structure of a polypeptide instead they keep the new polypeptide segregated from disruptive chemical conditions in the cytoplasmic environment while it folds spontaneously the chaperonin shown in figure 521 from the bacterium e coli is a giant multiprotein complex shaped like a hollow cylinder the cavity provides a shelter for folding polypeptides and recent research suggests that minute amounts of water are present ensuring a hydrophilic environment that aids the folding process molecular systems have been identified that interact with chaperonins and check whether proper folding has occurred such systems either refold the misfolded proteins correctly or mark them for destruction misfolding of polypeptides is a serious problem in cells that has come under increasing scrutiny by medical researchers many diseasessuch as cystic fibrosis alzheimers parkinsons and mad cow diseaseare associated with an accumulation of misfolded proteins in fact misfolded versions of the transthyretin protein featured in figure 518 have been implicated in several diseases including one form of senile dementia even when scientists have a correctly folded protein in hand determining its exact threedimensional structure is not simple for a single protein molecule has thousands of atoms the first 3d structures were worked out in the late 1950s for hemoglobin and a related protein called myoglobin the method that made these feats possible was xray crystallography which has since been used to determine the 3d structure of many other proteins in a recent example roger kornberg and his colleagues at stanford university used this method to elucidate the structure of rna polymerase an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the expression of genes figure 522 another method for analyzing protein structure is nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy which does not require protein crystallization a still newer approach employs bioinformatics see concept 56 to predict the 3d structure of polypeptides from their amino acid sequence xray crystallography nmr spectroscopy and bioinformatics are complementary approaches to understanding protein structure and function,protein structure is primarily determined by the unique amino acid sequence of a polypeptide chain which dictates how it folds into a specific threedimensional shape the folding process is influenced by the interactions responsible for secondary eg helices and pleated sheets and tertiary structures as well as environmental conditions such as ph temperature and salt concentration changes in these conditions can lead to denaturation a process where proteins lose their native shape and functionality denaturation this process can result from heat chemicals or a shift to a nonpolar environment causing proteins to unravel and become biologically inactive chaperonins these are proteins that assist in the correct folding of polypeptides by providing a protective environment allowing the new polypeptide to fold spontaneously without interference misfolded proteins accumulation of misfolded proteins can lead to diseases like cystic fibrosis alzheimers and parkinsons determining structure techniques like xray crystallography nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy and bioinformatics are used to study protein structures as the complexity of proteins makes this challenging the information for a proteins specific shape is inherent in its primary structure guiding its proper folding and functionality
the structures of dna and rna molecules dna molecules have two polynucleotides or strands that wind around an imaginary axis forming a double helix figure 525a the two sugarphosphate backbones run in opposite 5 3 directions from each other this arrangement is referred to as antiparallel somewhat like a divided highway the sugarphosphate backbones are on the outside of the helix and the nitrogenous bases are paired in the interior of the helix the two strands are held together by hydrogen bonds between the paired bases see figure 525a most dna molecules are very long with thousands or even millions of base pairs for example the one long dna double helix in a eukaryotic chromosome includes many genes each one a particular segment of the molecule in base pairing only certain bases in the double helix are compatible with each other adenine a in one strand always pairs with thymine t in the other and guanine g always pairs with cytosine c reading the sequence of bases along one strand of the double helix would tell us the sequence of bases along the other strand if a stretch of one strand has the base sequence 5aggtccg3 then the basepairing rules tell us that the same stretch of the other strand must have the sequence 3tccaggc5 the two strands of the double helix are complementary each the predictable counterpart of the other it is this feature of dna that makes it possible to generate two identical copies of each dna molecule in a cell that is preparing to divide when the cell divides the copies are distributed to the daughter cells making them genetically identical to the parent cell thus the structure of dna accounts for its function of transmitting genetic information whenever a cell reproduces rna molecules by contrast exist as single strands complementary base pairing can occur however between regions of two rna molecules or even between two stretches of nucleotides in the same rna molecule in fact base pairing within an rna molecule allows it to take on the particular threedimensional shape necessary for its function consider for example the type of rna called transfer rna trna which brings amino acids to the ribosome during the synthesis of a polypeptide a trna molecule is about 80 nucleotides in length its functional shape results from base pairing between nucleotides where complementary stretches of the molecule can run antiparallel to each other figure 525b note that in rna adenine a pairs with uracil u thymine t is not present in rna another difference between rna and dna is that dna almost always exists as a double helix whereas rna molecules are more variable in shape rnas are very versatile molecules and many biologists believe rna may have preceded dna as the carrier of genetic information in early forms of life see concept 251,dna and rna are essential molecules in genetics each with distinct structures and functions dna structure dna consists of two antiparallel strands forming a double helix the sugarphosphate backbones are on the outside with nitrogenous bases adenine a thymine t guanine g and cytosine c paired in the center a pairs with t and g pairs with c this complementary pairing allows dna to replicate accurately ensuring genetic information is passed on during cell division rna structure rna is typically a singlestranded molecule it can form complementary base pairs within itself or with other rna molecules allowing it to adopt specific threedimensional shapes necessary for its functions such as in transfer rna trna in rna a pairs with uracil u instead of t and rna exhibits a more variable structure compared to dna these differences illustrate the roles of dna in genetic storage and transmission while rna is more versatile and may have been a precursor to dna in early life forms
genomics and proteomics have transformed biological inquiry and applications experimental work in the first half of the 20th century established the role of dna as the bearer of genetic information passed from generation to generation that specified the functioning of living cells and organisms once the structure of the dna molecule was described in 1953 and the linear sequence of nucleotide bases was understood to specify the amino acid sequence of proteins biologists sought to decode genes by learning their base sequences the first chemical techniques for dna sequencing or determining the sequence of nucleotides along a dna strand one by one were developed in the 1970s researchers began to study gene sequences gene by gene and the more they learned the more questions they had how was expression of genes regulated genes and their protein products clearly interacted with each other but how what was the function if any of the dna that is not part of genes to fully understand the genetic functioning of a living organism the entire sequence of the full complement of dna the organisms genome would be most enlightening in spite of the apparent impracticality of this idea in the late 1980s several prominent biologists put forth an audacious proposal to launch a project that would sequence the entire human genomeall 3 billion bases of it this endeavor began in 1990 and was effectively completed in the early 2000s an unplanned but profound side benefit of this project the human genome projectwas the rapid development of faster and less expensive methods of sequencing this trend has continued apace the cost for sequencing 1 million bases in 2001 well over 5000 has decreased to less than 010 in 2012 and a human genome the first of which took over 10 years to sequence could be completed at todays pace in just a few days the number of genomes that have been fully sequenced has burgeoned generating reams of data and prompting development of bioinformatics the use of computer software and other computational tools that can handle and analyze these large data sets the reverberations of these developments have transformed the study of biology and related fields biologists often look at problems by analyzing large sets of genes or even comparing whole genomes of different species an approach called genomics a similar analysis of large sets of proteins including their sequences is called proteomics protein sequences can be determined either by using biochemical techniques or by translating the dna sequences that code for them these approaches permeate all fields of biology some examples of which are shown in figure 526 perhaps the most significant impact of genomics and proteomics on the field of biology as a whole has been their contributions to our understanding of evolution in addition to confirming evidence for evolution from the study of fossils and characteristics of currently existing species genomics has helped us tease out relationships among different groups of organisms that had not been resolved by previous types of evidence and thus infer evolutionary history dna and proteins as tape measures of evolution e vo l u t i o n we are accustomed to thinking of shared traits such as hair and milk production in mammals as evidence of shared ancestry because dna carries heritable information in the form of genes sequences of genes and their protein products document the hereditary background of an organism the linear sequences of nucleotides in dna molecules are passed from parents to offspring these sequences determine the amino acid sequences of proteins as a result siblings have greater similarity in their dna and proteins than do unrelated individuals of the same species given our evolutionary view of life we can extend this concept of molecular genealogy to relationships between species we would expect two species that appear to be closely related based on anatomical evidence and possibly fossil evidence to also share a greater proportion of their dna and protein sequences than do less closely related species in fact that is the case an example is the comparison of the polypeptide chain of human hemoglobin with the corresponding hemoglobin polypeptide in other vertebrates in this chain of 146 amino acids humans and gorillas differ in just 1 amino acid while humans and frogs more distantly related differ in 67 amino acids in the scientific skills exercise you can apply this sort of reasoning to additional species and this conclusion holds true as well when comparing whole genomes the human genome is 9598 identical to that of the chimpanzee but only roughly 85 identical to that of the mouse a more distant evolutionary relative molecular biology has added a new tape measure to the toolkit biologists use to assess evolutionary kinship,genomics and proteomics have revolutionized biology by providing tools to analyze genetic and protein information dna and genetic research the recognition of dna as the genetic material in the early 20th century set the stage for sequencing techniques developed in the 1970s the human genome project launched in 1990 aimed to sequence the entire human genome of 3 billion bases leading to advanced costeffective sequencing methods genomics this field studies large sets of genes and whole genomes enhancing our understanding of genetic functions and relationships among species proteomics this focuses on analyzing large sets of proteins and their sequences revealing their functional roles the integration of genomics and proteomics has transformed evolutionary studies showing that closely related species share more dna and protein similarities for example the human genome is 9598 identical to that of chimpanzees confirming the evolutionary relationships inferred from anatomical and fossil evidence these developments have provided new insights into the genetic basis of life and evolution
biologists use microscopes and the tools of biochemistry to study cells dr haifan lin featured in the interview before this chapter points out that studying the inner workings of cells is often the first step in making exciting biological discoveries but how do we study cells usually too small to be seen by the unaided eye microscopy the development of instruments that extend the human senses allowed the discovery and early study of cells microscopes were invented in 1590 and further refined during the 1600s cell walls were first seen by robert hooke in 1665 as he looked through a microscope at dead cells from the bark of an oak tree but it took the wonderfully crafted lenses of antoni van leeuwenhoek to visualize living cells imagine hookes awe when he visited van leeuwenhoek in 1674 and the world of microorganismswhat his host called very little animalculeswas revealed to him the microscopes first used by renaissance scientists as well as the microscopes you are likely to use in the laboratory are all light microscopes in a light microscope lm visible light is passed through the specimen and then through glass lenses the lenses refract bend the light in such a way that the image of the specimen is magnified as it is projected into the eye or into a camera see appendix d three important parameters in microscopy are magnification resolution and contrast magnification is the ratio of an objects image size to its real size light microscopes can magnify effectively to about 1000 times the actual size of the specimen at greater magnifications additional details cannot be seen clearly resolution is a measure of the clarity of the image it is the minimum distance two points can be separated and still be distinguished as separate points for example what appears to the unaided eye as one star in the sky may be resolved as twin stars with a telescope which has a higher resolving ability than the eye similarly using standard techniques the light microscope cannot resolve detail finer than about 02 micrometer m or 200 nanometers nm regardless of the magnification figure 62 the third parameter contrast is the difference in brightness between the light and dark areas of an image methods for enhancing contrast include staining or labeling cell components to stand out visually figure 63 shows some different types of microscopy study this figure as you read this section until recently the resolution barrier prevented cell biologists from using standard light microscopy when studying organelles the membraneenclosed structures within eukaryotic cells to see these structures in any detail required the development of a new instrument in the 1950s the electron microscope was introduced to biology rather than focusing light the electron microscope em focuses a beam of electrons through the specimen or onto its surface see appendix d resolution is inversely related to the wavelength of the light or electrons a microscope uses for imaging and electron beams have much shorter wavelengths than visible light modern electron microscopes can theoretically achieve a resolution of about 0002 nm though in practice they usually cannot resolve structures smaller than about 2 nm across still this is a 100fold improvement over the standard light microscope the scanning electron microscope sem is especially useful for detailed study of the topography of a specimen see figure 63 the electron beam scans the surface of the sample usually coated with a thin film of gold the beam excites electrons on the surface and these secondary electrons are detected by a device that translates the pattern of electrons into an electronic signal sent to a video screen the result is an image of the specimens surface that appears threedimensional the transmission electron microscope tem is used to study the internal structure of cells see figure 63 the tem aims an electron beam through a very thin section of the specimen much as a light microscope aims light through a sample on a slide for the tem the specimen has been stained with atoms of heavy metals which attach to certain cellular structures thus enhancing the electron density of some parts of the cell more than others the electrons passing through the specimen are scattered more in the denser regions so fewer are transmitted the image displays the pattern of transmitted electrons instead of using glass lenses both the sem and tem use electromagnets as lenses to bend the paths of the electrons ultimately focusing the image onto a monitor for viewing electron microscopes have revealed many subcellular structures that were impossible to resolve with the light microscope but the light microscope offers advantages especially in studying living cells a disadvantage of electron microscopy is that the methods used to prepare the specimen kill the cells specimen preparation for any type of microscopy can introduce artifacts structural features seen in micrographs that do not exist in the living cell in the past several decades light microscopy has been revitalized by major technical advances see figure 63 labeling individual cellular molecules or structures with fluorescent markers has made it possible to see such structures with increasing detail in addition both confocal and deconvolution microscopy have produced sharper images of threedimensional tissues and cells finally a group of new techniques and labeling molecules developed in recent years have allowed researchers to break the resolution barrier and distinguish subcellular structures as small as 1020 nm across as this superresolution microscopy becomes more widespread the images we see of living cells are proving as aweinspiring to us as van leeuwenhoeks were to robert hooke 350 years ago microscopes are the most important tools of cytology the study of cell structure understanding the function of each structure however required the integration of cytology and biochemistry the study of the chemical processes metabolism of cells brightfield unstained specimen light passes directly through the specimen unless the cell is naturally pigmented or artificially stained the image has little contrast the first four light micrographs show human cheek epithelial cells the scale bar pertains to all four micrographs brightfield stained specimen staining with various dyes enhances contrast most staining procedures require that cells be fixed preserved thereby killing them phasecontrast variations in density within the specimen are amplified to enhance contrast in unstained cells this is especially useful for examining living unpigmented cells differentialinterferencecontrast nomarski as in phasecontrast microscopy optical modifications are used to exaggerate differences in density the image appears almost 3d fluorescence the locations of specific molecules in the cell can be revealed by labeling the molecules with fluorescent dyes or antibodies some cells have molecules that fluoresce on their own fluorescent substances absorb ultraviolet radiation and emit visible light in this fluorescently labeled uterine cell nuclear material is blue organelles called mitochondria are orange and the cells skeleton is green confocal the top image is a standard fluorescence micrograph of fluorescently labeled nervous tissue nerve cells are green support cells are orange and regions of overlap are yellow below it is a confocal image of the same tissue using a laser this optical sectioning technique eliminates outoffocus light from a thick sample creating a single plane of fluorescence in the image by capturing sharp images at many different planes a 3d reconstruction can be created the standard image is blurry because outoffocus light is not excluded deconvolution the top of this split image is a compilation of standard fluorescence micrographs through the depth of a white blood cell below is an image of the same cell reconstructed from many blurry images at different planes each of which was processed using deconvolution software this process digitally removes outoffocus light and reassigns it to its source creating a much sharper 3d image superresolution on the top is a confocal image of part of a nerve cell using a fluorescent label that binds to a molecule clustered in small sacs in the cell vesicles that are 40 nm in diameter the greenishyellow spots are blurry because 40 nm is below the 200nm limit of resolution for standard light microscopy below is an image of the same part of the cell seen using a new superresolution technique sophisticated equipment is used to light up individual fluorescent molecules and record their position combining information from many molecules in different places breaks the limit of resolution resulting in the sharp greenishyellow dots seen here,biologists utilize microscopes and biochemistry tools to explore cells which are often too small for the naked eye to observe the invention of the microscope in the late 16th century marked the beginning of cellular studies with robert hooke observing cell walls in 1665 and antoni van leeuwenhoek later visualizing living cells microscopy employs three key parameters magnification the size ratio of an objects image to its actual size light microscopes can magnify up to 1000 times but are limited to a resolution of about 02 micrometers m resolution the clarity of the image or the ability to distinguish two separate points contrast the difference in brightness between light and dark areas in an image enhanced through staining or labeling for studying organelles electron microscopes em were introduced in the 1950s em uses electron beams achieving a significantly higher resolution down to about 2 nanometers than light microscopes there are two main types of em scanning electron microscope sem scans the specimens surface creating a threedimensional image transmission electron microscope tem aims electrons through thin samples to reveal internal structures recent advancements in light microscopy including fluorescent markers and superresolution techniques have further improved our ability to visualize living cells without damaging them these innovations in microscopy are essential for cytology the study of cell structure and biochemistry the study of cellular processes enabling a deeper understanding of cellular functions
cell fractionation a useful technique for studying cell structure and function is cell fractionation figure 64 which takes cells apart and separates major organelles and other subcellular structures from one another the piece of equipment that is used for this task is the centrifuge which spins test tubes holding mixtures of disrupted cells at a series of increasing speeds at each speed the resulting force causes a subset of the cell components to settle to the bottom of the tube forming a pellet at lower speeds the pellet consists of larger components and higher speeds result in a pellet with smaller components cell fractionation enables researchers to prepare specific cell components in bulk and identify their functions a task not usually possible with intact cells for example on one of the cell fractions biochemical tests showed the presence of enzymes involved in cellular respiration while electron microscopy revealed large numbers of the organelles called mitochondria together these data helped biologists determine that mitochondria are the sites of cellular respiration biochemistry and cytology thus complement each other in correlating cell function with structure,cell fractionation is an essential technique used to study cell structure and function by separating cellular components this process involves breaking down cells and using a centrifuge to spin mixtures at varying speeds as the centrifuge spins different components settle to the bottom of the test tubes forming pellets based on their size lower speeds larger components such as whole cells or nuclei settle first higher speeds smaller organelles such as mitochondria and ribosomes form pellets at increased speeds this technique allows researchers to isolate specific organelles in bulk facilitating biochemical tests to identify their functions for example analysis of a fraction containing mitochondria revealed the presence of enzymes involved in cellular respiration confirming that mitochondria are the sites where this process occurs thus cell fractionation integrates biochemistry and cytology linking cellular structure to its functional roles
eukaryotic cells have internal membranes that compartmentalize their functions cellsthe basic structural and functional units of every organismare of two distinct types prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms of the domains bacteria and archaea consist of prokaryotic cells protists fungi animals and plants all consist of eukaryotic cells protist is an informal term referring to a group of mostly unicellular eukaryotes comparing prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells all cells share certain basic features they are all bounded by a selective barrier called the plasma membrane inside all cells is a semifluid jellylike substance called cytosol in which subcellular components are suspended all cells contain chromosomes which carry genes in the form of dna and all cells have ribosomes tiny complexes that make proteins according to instructions from the genes a major difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells is the location of their dna in a eukaryotic cell most of the dna is in an organelle called the nucleus which is bounded by a double membrane see figure 68 in a prokaryotic cell the dna is concentrated in a region that is not membraneenclosed called the nucleoid figure 65 eukaryotic means true nucleus from the greek eu true and karyon kernel referring to the nucleus and prokaryotic means before nucleus from the greek pro before reflecting the earlier evolution of prokaryotic cells the interior of either type of cell is called the cytoplasm in eukaryotic cells this term refers only to the region between the nucleus and the plasma membrane within the cytoplasm of a eukaryotic cell suspended in cytosol are a variety of organelles of specialized form and function these membranebounded structures are absent in prokaryotic cells another distinction between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells however in spite of the absence of organelles the prokaryotic cytoplasm is not a formless soup of cytoplasm but appears to be organized into different regions eukaryotic cells are generally much larger than prokaryotic cells see figure 62 size is a general feature of cell structure that relates to function the logistics of carrying out cellular metabolism sets limits on cell size at the lower limit the smallest cells known are bacteria called mycoplasmas which have diameters between 01 and 10 m these are perhaps the smallest packages with enough dna to program metabolism and enough enzymes and other cellular equipment to carry out the activities necessary for a cell to sustain itself and reproduce typical bacteria are 15 m in diameter about ten times the size of mycoplasmas eukaryotic cells are typically 10100 m in diameter metabolic requirements also impose theoretical upper limits on the size that is practical for a single cell at the boundary of every cell the plasma membrane functions as a selective barrier that allows passage of enough oxygen nutrients and wastes to service the entire cell figure 66 for each square micrometer of membrane only a limited amount of a particular substance can cross per second so the ratio of surface area to volume is critical as a cell or any other object increases in size its surface area grows proportionately less than its volume area is proportional to a linear dimension squared whereas volume is proportional to the linear dimension cubed thus a smaller object has a greater ratio of surface area to volume figure 67 the scientific skills exercise gives you a chance to calculate the volumes and surface areas of two actual cellsa mature yeast cell and a cell budding from it the need for a surface area sufficiently large to accommodate the volume helps explain the microscopic size of most cells and the narrow elongated shapes of others such as nerve cells larger organisms do not generally have larger cells than smaller organismsthey simply have more cells see figure 67 a sufficiently high ratio of surface area to volume is especially important in cells that exchange a lot of material with their surroundings such as intestinal cells such cells may have many long thin projections from their surface called microvilli which increase surface area without an appreciable increase in volume the evolutionary relationships between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells will be discussed later in this chapter and prokaryotic cells will be described in detail in chapter 27 most of the discussion of cell structure that follows in this chapter applies to eukaryotic cells a panoramic view of the eukaryotic cell in addition to the plasma membrane at its outer surface a eukaryotic cell has extensive elaborately arranged internal membranes that divide the cell into compartmentsthe organelles mentioned earlier the cells compartments provide different local environments that support specific metabolic functions so incompatible processes can occur simultaneously in a single cell the plasma membrane and organelle membranes also participate directly in the cells metabolism because many enzymes are built right into the membranes the basic fabric of most biological membranes is a double layer of phospholipids and other lipids embedded in this lipid bilayer or attached to its surfaces are diverse proteins see figure 66 however each type of membrane has a unique composition of lipids and proteins suited to that membranes specific functions for example enzymes embedded in the membranes of the organelles called mitochondria function in cellular respiration because membranes are so fundamental to the organization of the cell chapter 7 will discuss them in detail before continuing with this chapter examine the eukaryotic cells in figure 68 on the next two pages the generalized diagrams of an animal cell and a plant cell introduce the various organelles and show the key differences between animal and plant cells the micrographs at the bottom of the figure give you a glimpse of cells from different types of eukaryotic organisms,eukaryotic cells found in organisms such as protists fungi animals and plants are characterized by a true nucleus and internal membranes that compartmentalize various functions key distinctions between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells include cell structure eukaryotic cells contain organelles which are membranebound structures with specialized functions while prokaryotic cells like bacteria lack these organelles and have their dna concentrated in a nonmembraneenclosed region called the nucleoid cell size eukaryotic cells typically range from 10 to 100 m while prokaryotic cells are generally 1 to 5 m in diameter the size of cells is influenced by the surface areatovolume ratio which is critical for efficient material exchange compartmentalization internal membranes create distinct environments within eukaryotic cells allowing incompatible metabolic processes to occur simultaneously this organization is crucial for cellular functions with examples like mitochondria which contain enzymes for cellular respiration understanding these features helps explain how eukaryotic cells maintain complex functions necessary for life
ribosomes build proteins in two cytoplasmic locales at any given time free ribosomes are suspended in the cytosol while bound ribosomes are attached to the outside of the endoplasmic reticulum or nuclear envelope see figure 610 bound and free ribosomes are structurally identical and ribosomes can alternate between the two roles most of the proteins made on free ribosomes function within the cytosol examples are enzymes that catalyze the first steps of sugar breakdown bound ribosomes generally make proteins that are destined for insertion into membranes for packaging within certain organelles such as lysosomes see figure 68 or for export from the cell secretion cells that specialize in protein secretionfor instance the cells of the pancreas that secrete digestive enzymesfrequently have a high proportion of bound ribosomes you will learn more about ribosome structure and function in chapter 17,the nucleus and ribosomes are crucial components in eukaryotic cells responsible for housing genetic information and synthesizing proteins respectively nucleus the nucleus is the control center of the cell containing most of the cells dna organized into chromosomes it is surrounded by a double membrane known as the nuclear envelope which has pores that regulate the entry and exit of substances within the nucleus the nucleolus is responsible for synthesizing ribosomal rna rrna and assembling ribosome subunits from rrna and proteins the nucleus directs protein synthesis by creating messenger rna mrna from dna instructions which then exits through nuclear pores to the cytoplasm ribosomes ribosomes made of rrna and proteins are nonmembranebound structures that carry out protein synthesis they can be found either free in the cytosol or bound to the endoplasmic reticulum er and the nuclear envelope free ribosomes synthesize proteins for use within the cytosol while bound ribosomes typically produce proteins destined for membranes organelles or secretion cells with high protein synthesis such as pancreatic cells have many ribosomes and prominent nucleoli
the endomembrane system regulates protein traffic and performs metabolic functions in the cell many of the different membranes of the eukaryotic cell are part of the endomembrane system which includes the nuclear envelope the endoplasmic reticulum the golgi apparatus lysosomes various kinds of vesicles and vacuoles and the plasma membrane this system carries out a variety of tasks in the cell including synthesis of proteins transport of proteins into membranes and organelles or out of the cell metabolism and movement of lipids and detoxification of poisons the membranes of this system are related either through direct physical continuity or by the transfer of membrane segments as tiny vesicles sacs made of membrane despite these relationships the various membranes are not identical in structure and function moreover the thickness molecular composition and types of chemical reactions carried out in a given membrane are not fixed but may be modified several times during the membranes life having already discussed the nuclear envelope we will now focus on the endoplasmic reticulum and the other endomembranes to which the endoplasmic reticulum gives rise the endoplasmic reticulum biosynthetic factory the endoplasmic reticulum er is such an extensive network of membranes that it accounts for more than half the total membrane in many eukaryotic cells the word endoplasmic means within the cytoplasm and reticulum is latin for little net the er consists of a network of membranous tubules and sacs called cisternae from the latin cisterna a reservoir for a liquid the er membrane separates the internal compartment of the er called the er lumen cavity or cisternal space from the cytosol and because the er membrane is continuous with the nuclear envelope the space between the two membranes of the envelope is continuous with the lumen of the er figure 611 there are two distinct though connected regions of the er that differ in structure and function smooth er and rough er smooth er is so named because its outer surface lacks ribosomes rough er is studded with ribosomes on the outer surface of the membrane and thus appears rough through the electron microscope as already mentioned ribosomes are also attached to the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear envelopes outer membrane which is continuous with rough er functions of smooth er the smooth er functions in diverse metabolic processes which vary with cell type these processes include synthesis of lipids metabolism of carbohydrates detoxification of drugs and poisons and storage of calcium ions enzymes of the smooth er are important in the synthesis of lipids including oils steroids and new membrane phospholipids among the steroids produced by the smooth er in animal cells are the sex hormones of vertebrates and the various steroid hormones secreted by the adrenal glands the cells that synthesize and secrete these hormonesin the testes and ovaries for exampleare rich in smooth er a structural feature that fits the function of these cells other enzymes of the smooth er help detoxify drugs and poisons especially in liver cells detoxification usually involves adding hydroxyl groups to drug molecules making them more soluble and easier to flush from the body the sedative phenobarbital and other barbiturates are examples of drugs metabolized in this manner by smooth er in liver cells in fact barbiturates alcohol and many other drugs induce the proliferation of smooth er and its associated detoxification enzymes thus increasing the rate of detoxification this in turn increases tolerance to the drugs meaning that higher doses are required to achieve a particular effect such as sedation also because some of the detoxification enzymes have relatively broad action the proliferation of smooth er in response to one drug can increase the need for higher dosages of other drugs as well barbiturate abuse for example can decrease the effectiveness of certain antibiotics and other useful drugs the smooth er also stores calcium ions in muscle cells for example the smooth er membrane pumps calcium ions from the cytosol into the er lumen when a muscle cell is stimulated by a nerve impulse calcium ions rush back across the er membrane into the cytosol and trigger contraction of the muscle cell in other cell types calcium ion release from the smooth er triggers different responses such as secretion of vesicles carrying newly synthesized proteins functions of rough er many cells secrete proteins that are produced by ribosomes attached to rough er for example certain pancreatic cells synthesize the protein insulin in the er and secrete this hormone into the bloodstream as a polypeptide chain grows from a bound ribosome the chain is threaded into the er lumen through a pore formed by a protein complex in the er membrane the new polypeptide folds into its functional shape as it enters the er lumen most secretory proteins are glycoproteins proteins with carbohydrates covalently bonded to them the carbohydrates are attached to the proteins in the er lumen by enzymes built into the er membrane after secretory proteins are formed the er membrane keeps them separate from proteins that are produced by free ribosomes and that will remain in the cytosol secretory proteins depart from the er wrapped in the membranes of vesicles that bud like bubbles from a specialized region called transitional er see figure 611 vesicles in transit from one part of the cell to another are called transport vesicles we will discuss their fate shortly in addition to making secretory proteins rough er is a membrane factory for the cell it grows in place by adding membrane proteins and phospholipids to its own membrane as polypeptides destined to be membrane proteins grow from the ribosomes they are inserted into the er membrane itself and anchored there by their hydrophobic portions like the smooth er the rough er also makes membrane phospholipids enzymes built into the er membrane assemble phospholipids from precursors in the cytosol the er membrane expands and portions of it are transferred in the form of transport vesicles to other components of the endomembrane system,the endomembrane system in eukaryotic cells is a complex network that regulates protein traffic and performs essential metabolic functions it comprises the nuclear envelope endoplasmic reticulum er golgi apparatus lysosomes vesicles vacuoles and the plasma membrane endoplasmic reticulum er this extensive membrane network accounts for more than half the total membrane in many cells and has two regions smooth er lacking ribosomes it is involved in lipid synthesis including steroids and phospholipids detoxification of drugs and poisons especially in liver cells and storage of calcium ions which are crucial for muscle contractions and other cellular activities rough er studded with ribosomes it synthesizes secretory proteins such as insulin as polypeptides grow they enter the er lumen where they fold into functional shapes and often become glycoproteins essential for cellular function the rough er also adds membrane proteins and phospholipids contributing to the cells membrane structure in summary the endomembrane system is vital for synthesizing modifying and transporting proteins and lipids ensuring that cellular processes are efficient and wellregulated
the golgi apparatus shipping and receiving center after leaving the er many transport vesicles travel to the golgi apparatus we can think of the golgi as a warehouse for receiving sorting shipping and even some manufacturing here products of the er such as proteins are modified and stored and then sent to other destinations not surprisingly the golgi apparatus is especially extensive in cells specialized for secretion the golgi apparatus consists of flattened membranous sacscisternaelooking like a stack of pita bread figure 612 a cell may have many even hundreds of these stacks the membrane of each cisterna in a stack separates its internal space from the cytosol vesicles concentrated in the vicinity of the golgi apparatus are engaged in the transfer of material between parts of the golgi and other structures a golgi stack has a distinct structural directionality with the membranes of cisternae on opposite sides of the stack differing in thickness and molecular composition the two sides of a golgi stack are referred to as the cis face and the trans face these act respectively as the receiving and shipping departments of the golgi apparatus the term cis means on the same side and the cis face is usually located near the er transport vesicles move material from the er to the golgi apparatus a vesicle that buds from the er can add its membrane and the contents of its lumen to the cis face by fusing with a golgi membrane the trans face on the opposite side gives rise to vesicles that pinch off and travel to other sites products of the endoplasmic reticulum are usually modified during their transit from the cis region to the trans region of the golgi apparatus for example glycoproteins formed in the er have their carbohydrates modified first in the er itself then as they pass through the golgi the golgi removes some sugar monomers and substitutes others producing a large variety of carbohydrates membrane phospholipids may also be altered in the golgi in addition to its finishing work the golgi apparatus also manufactures some macromolecules many polysaccharides secreted by cells are golgi products for example pectins and certain other noncellulose polysaccharides are made in the golgi of plant cells and then incorporated along with cellulose into their cell walls like secretory proteins nonprotein golgi products that will be secreted depart from the trans face of the golgi inside transport vesicles that eventually fuse with the plasma membrane the golgi manufactures and refines its products in stages with different cisternae containing unique teams of enzymes until recently biologists viewed the golgi as a static structure with products in various stages of processing transferred from one cisterna to the next by vesicles while this may occur research from several labs has given rise to a new model of the golgi as a more dynamic structure according to the cisternal maturation model the cisternae of the golgi actually progress forward from the cis to the trans face carrying and modifying their cargo as they move figure 612 shows the details of this model before a golgi stack dispatches its products by budding vesicles from the trans face it sorts these products and targets them for various parts of the cell molecular identification tags such as phosphate groups added to the golgi products aid in sorting by acting like zip codes on mailing labels finally transport vesicles budded from the golgi may have external molecules on their membranes that recognize docking sites on the surface of specific organelles or on the plasma membrane thus targeting the vesicles appropriately lysosomes digestive compartments a lysosome is a membranous sac of hydrolytic enzymes that many eukaryotic cells use to digest hydrolyze macromolecules lysosomal enzymes work best in the acidic environment found in lysosomes if a lysosome breaks open or leaks its contents the released enzymes are not very active because the cytosol has a nearneutral ph however excessive leakage from a large number of lysosomes can destroy a cell by selfdigestion hydrolytic enzymes and lysosomal membrane are made by rough er and then transferred to the golgi apparatus for further processing at least some lysosomes probably arise by budding from the trans face of the golgi apparatus see figure 612 how are the proteins of the inner surface of the lysosomal membrane and the digestive enzymes themselves spared from destruction apparently the threedimensional shapes of these proteins protect vulnerable bonds from enzymatic attack lysosomes carry out intracellular digestion in a variety of circumstances amoebas and many other unicellular eukaryotes eat by engulfing smaller organisms or food particles a process called phagocytosis from the greek phagein to eat and kytos vessel referring here to the cell the food vacuole formed in this way then fuses with a lysosome whose enzymes digest the food figure 613a bottom digestion products including simple sugars amino acids and other monomers pass into the cytosol and become nutrients for the cell some human cells also carry out phagocytosis among them are macrophages a type of white blood cell that helps defend the body by engulfing and destroying bacteria and other invaders see figure 613a top and figure 631 lysosomes also use their hydrolytic enzymes to recycle the cells own organic material a process called autophagy during autophagy a damaged organelle or small amount of cytosol becomes surrounded by a double membrane of unknown origin and a lysosome fuses with the outer membrane of this vesicle figure 613b the lysosomal enzymes dismantle the enclosed material and the resulting small organic compounds are released to the cytosol for reuse with the help of lysosomes the cell continually renews itself a human liver cell for example recycles half of its macromolecules each week the cells of people with inherited lysosomal storage diseases lack a functioning hydrolytic enzyme normally present in lysosomes the lysosomes become engorged with indigestible material which begins to interfere with other cellular activities in taysachs disease for example a lipiddigesting enzyme is missing or inactive and the brain becomes impaired by an accumulation of lipids in the cells fortunately lysosomal storage diseases are rare in the general population vacuoles diverse maintenance compartments vacuoles are large vesicles derived from the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus thus vacuoles are an integral part of a cells endomembrane system like all cellular membranes the vacuolar membrane is selective in transporting solutes as a result the solution inside a vacuole differs in composition from the cytosol vacuoles perform a variety of functions in different kinds of cells food vacuoles formed by phagocytosis have already been mentioned see figure 613a many unicellular eukaryotes living in fresh water have contractile vacuoles that pump excess water out of the cell thereby maintaining a suitable concentration of ions and molecules inside the cell see figure 713 in plants and fungi certain vacuoles carry out enzymatic hydrolysis a function shared by lysosomes in animal cells in fact some biologists consider these hydrolytic vacuoles to be a type of lysosome in plants small vacuoles can hold reserves of important organic compounds such as the proteins stockpiled in the storage cells in seeds vacuoles may also help protect the plant against herbivores by storing compounds that are poisonous or unpalatable to animals some plant vacuoles contain pigments such as the red and blue pigments of petals that help attract pollinating insects to flowers mature plant cells generally contain a large central vacuole figure 614 which develops by the coalescence of smaller vacuoles the solution inside the central vacuole called cell sap is the plant cells main repository of inorganic ions including potassium and chloride the central vacuole plays a major role in the growth of plant cells which enlarge as the vacuole absorbs water enabling the cell to become larger with a minimal investment in new cytoplasm the cytosol often occupies only a thin layer between the central vacuole and the plasma membrane so the ratio of plasma membrane surface to cytosolic volume is sufficient even for a large plant cell the endomembrane system a review figure 615 reviews the endomembrane system showing the flow of membrane lipids and proteins through the various organelles as the membrane moves from the er to the golgi and then elsewhere its molecular composition and metabolic functions are modified along with those of its contents the endomembrane system is a complex and dynamic player in the cells compartmental organization well continue our tour of the cell with some organelles that are not closely related to the endomembrane system but play crucial roles in the energy transformations carried out by cells,the golgi apparatus is a critical organelle that processes modifies and sorts products from the endoplasmic reticulum er it functions like a warehouse receiving and shipping cellular materials and is most active in cells involved in secretion structurally it consists of stacked membranebound cisternae the cis face receives materials from the er and the trans face ships them to other cell parts as products move through the golgi they are modified especially proteins like glycoproteins the golgi also synthesizes polysaccharides and manufactures macromolecules lysosomes are digestive organelles that break down macromolecules aid in recycling cellular materials autophagy and are involved in immune responses phagocytosis if lysosomes malfunction as in taysachs disease harmful substances accumulate vacuoles large vesicles from the er and golgi perform diverse functions plant vacuoles store ions aid in growth and help defend against herbivores in freshwater protists contractile vacuoles expel excess water the endomembrane system includes the er golgi apparatus lysosomes and vacuoles working together for cellular organization transport and metabolism
mitochondria and chloroplasts change energy from one form to another organisms transform the energy they acquire from their surroundings in eukaryotic cells mitochondria and chloroplasts are the organelles that convert energy to forms that cells can use for work mitochondria singular mitochondrion are the sites of cellular respiration the metabolic process that uses oxygen to drive the generation of atp by extracting energy from sugars fats and other fuels chloroplasts found in plants and algae are the sites of photosynthesis this process in chloroplasts converts solar energy to chemical energy by absorbing sunlight and using it to drive the synthesis of organic compounds such as sugars from carbon dioxide and water in addition to having related functions mitochondria and chloroplasts share similar evolutionary origins which well discuss briefly before describing their structures in this section we will also consider the peroxisome an oxidative organelle the evolutionary origin of the peroxisome as well as its relation to other organelles is still a matter of some debate the evolutionary origins of mitochondria and chloroplasts evolution mitochondria and chloroplasts display similarities with bacteria that led to the endosymbiont theory illustrated in figure 616 this theory states that an early ancestor of eukaryotic cells engulfed an oxygenusing non photosynthetic prokaryotic cell eventually the engulfed cell formed a relationship with the host cell in which it was enclosed becoming an endosymbiont a cell living within another cell indeed over the course of evolution the host cell and its endosymbiont merged into a single organism a eukaryotic cell with a mitochondrion at least one of these cells may have then taken up a photosynthetic prokaryote becoming the ancestor of eukaryotic cells that contain chloroplasts this is a widely accepted theory which we will discuss in more detail in chapter 25 this theory is consistent with many structural features of mitochondria and chloroplasts first rather than being bounded by a single membrane like organelles of the endomembrane system mitochondria and typical chloroplasts have two membranes surrounding them chloroplasts also have an internal system of membranous sacs there is evidence that the ancestral engulfed prokaryotes had two outer membranes which became the double membranes of mitochondria and chloroplasts second like prokaryotes mitochondria and chloroplasts contain ribosomes as well as multiple circular dna molecules associated with their inner membranes the dna in these organelles programs the synthesis of some organelle proteins on ribosomes that have been synthesized and assembled there as well third also consistent with their probable evolutionary origins as cells mitochondria and chloroplasts are autonomous somewhat independent organelles that grow and reproduce within the cell next we focus on the structures of mitochondria and chloroplasts while providing an overview of their structures and functions in chapters 9 and 10 we will examine their roles as energy transformers mitochondria chemical energy conversion mitochondria are found in nearly all eukaryotic cells including those of plants animals fungi and most unicellular eukaryotes some cells have a single large mitochondrion but more often a cell has hundreds or even thousands of mitochondria the number correlates with the cells level of metabolic activity for example cells that move or contract have proportionally more mitochondria per volume than less active cells each of the two membranes enclosing the mitochondrion is a phospholipid bilayer with a unique collection of embedded proteins figure 617 the outer membrane is smooth but the inner membrane is convoluted with infoldings called cristae the inner membrane divides the mitochondrion into two internal compartments the first is the intermembrane space the narrow region between the inner and outer membranes the second compartment the mitochondrial matrix is enclosed by the inner membrane the matrix contains many different enzymes as well as the mitochondrial dna and ribosomes enzymes in the matrix catalyze some of the steps of cellular respiration other proteins that function in respiration including the enzyme that makes atp are built into the inner membrane as highly folded surfaces the cristae give the inner mitochondrial membrane a large surface area thus enhancing the productivity of cellular respiration this is another example of structure fitting function mitochondria are generally in the range of 110 m long timelapse films of living cells reveal mitochondria moving around changing their shapes and fusing or dividing in two unlike the static structures seen in electron micrographs of dead cells these observations helped cell biologists understand that mitochondria in a living cell form a branched tubular network seen in a whole cell in figure 617b that is in a dynamic state of flux chloroplasts capture of light energy chloroplasts contain the green pigment chlorophyll along with enzymes and other molecules that function in the photosynthetic production of sugar these lensshaped organelles about 36 m in length are found in leaves and other green organs of plants and in algae figure 618 see also figure 626c the contents of a chloroplast are partitioned from the cytosol by an envelope consisting of two membranes separated by a very narrow intermembrane space inside the chloroplast is another membranous system in the form of flattened interconnected sacs called thylakoids in some regions thylakoids are stacked like poker chips each stack is called a granum plural grana the fluid outside the thylakoids is the stroma which contains the chloroplast dna and ribosomes as well as many enzymes the membranes of the chloroplast divide the chloroplast space into three compartments the intermembrane space the stroma and the thylakoid space this compartmental organization enables the chloroplast to convert light energy to chemical energy during photosynthesis you will learn more about photosynthesis in chapter 10 as with mitochondria the static and rigid appearance of chloroplasts in micrographs or schematic diagrams is not true to their dynamic behavior in the living cell their shape is changeable and they grow and occasionally pinch in two reproducing themselves they are mobile and with mitochondria and other organelles move around the cell along tracks of the cytoskeleton a structural network we will consider later in this chapter the chloroplast is a specialized member of a family of closely related plant organelles called plastids one type of plastid the amyloplast is a colorless organelle that stores starch amylose particularly in roots and tubers another is the chromoplast which has pigments that give fruits and flowers their orange and yellow hues peroxisomes oxidation the peroxisome is a specialized metabolic compartment bounded by a single membrane figure 619 peroxisomes contain enzymes that remove hydrogen atoms from various substrates and transfer them to oxygen o2 producing hydrogen peroxide h2o2 as a byproduct from which the organelle derives its name these reactions have many different functions some peroxisomes use oxygen to break fatty acids down into smaller molecules that are transported to mitochondria and used as fuel for cellular respiration peroxisomes in the liver detoxify alcohol and other harmful compounds by transferring hydrogen from the poisons to oxygen the h2o2 formed by peroxisomes is itself toxic but the organelle also contains an enzyme that converts h2o2 to water this is an excellent example of how the cells compartmental structure is crucial to its functions the enzymes that produce h2o2 and those that dispose of this toxic compound are sequestered away from other cellular components that could be damaged specialized peroxisomes called glyoxysomes are found in the fatstoring tissues of plant seeds these organelles contain enzymes that initiate the conversion of fatty acids to sugar which the emerging seedling uses as a source of energy and carbon until it can produce its own sugar by photosynthesis how peroxisomes are related to other organelles is still an open question they grow larger by incorporating proteins made in the cytosol and er as well as lipids made in the er and within the peroxisome itself peroxisomes may increase in number by splitting in two when they reach a certain size sparking the suggestion of an endosymbiotic evolutionary origin but others argue against this scenario discussion of this issue is ongoing,mitochondria and chloroplasts are essential organelles in eukaryotic cells that transform energy into usable forms mitochondria are the sites of cellular respiration a process that generates atp by extracting energy from sugars fats and other fuels using oxygen chloroplasts found in plants and algae carry out photosynthesis converting solar energy into chemical energy stored in sugars the endosymbiont theory proposes that mitochondria and chloroplasts originated from freeliving prokaryotes that were engulfed by an ancestral eukaryotic cell this theory is supported by the fact that these organelles have two membranes contain their own ribosomes and dna and are somewhat autonomous growing and reproducing independently within the cell mitochondria have two membranes with the inner membrane folded into cristae which enhance the efficiency of cellular respiration inside the mitochondrial matrix contains enzymes dna and ribosomes chloroplasts contain the green pigment chlorophyll and consist of thylakoid membranes organized into stacks called grana where light energy is converted into chemical energy peroxisomes are specialized compartments involved in oxidation reactions including detoxification and the breakdown of fatty acids
the cytoskeleton is a network of fibers that organizes structures and activities in the cell in the early days of electron microscopy biologists thought that the organelles of a eukaryotic cell floated freely in the cytosol but improvements in both light microscopy and electron microscopy have revealed the cytoskeleton a network of fibers extending throughout the cytoplasm figure 620 bacterial cells also have fibers that form a type of cytoskeleton constructed of proteins similar to eukaryotic ones but here we will concentrate on eukaryotes the eukaryotic cytoskeleton which plays a major role in organizing the structures and activities of the cell is composed of three types of molecular structures microtubules microfilaments and intermediate filaments roles of the cytoskeleton support and motility the most obvious function of the cytoskeleton is to give mechanical support to the cell and maintain its shape this is especially important for animal cells which lack walls the remarkable strength and resilience of the cytoskeleton as a whole are based on its architecture like a dome tent the cytoskeleton is stabilized by a balance between opposing forces exerted by its elements and just as the skeleton of an animal helps fix the positions of other body parts the cytoskeleton provides anchorage for many organelles and even cytosolic enzyme molecules the cytoskeleton is more dynamic than an animal skeleton however it can be quickly dismantled in one part of the cell and reassembled in a new location changing the shape of the cell some types of cell motility movement also involve the cytoskeleton the term cell motility includes both changes in cell location and movements of cell parts cell motility generally requires interaction of the cytoskeleton with motor proteins there are many such examples cytoskeletal elements and motor proteins work together with plasma membrane molecules to allow whole cells to move along fibers outside the cell inside the cell vesicles and other organelles often use motor protein feet to walk to their destinations along a track provided by the cytoskeleton for example this is how vesicles containing neurotransmitter molecules migrate to the tips of axons the long extensions of nerve cells that release these molecules as chemical signals to adjacent nerve cells figure 621 the cytoskeleton also manipulates the plasma membrane bending it inward to form food vacuoles or other phagocytic vesicles components of the cytoskeleton now lets look more closely at the three main types of fibers that make up the cytoskeleton microtubules are the thickest of the three types microfilaments also called actin filaments are the thinnest and intermediate filaments are fibers with diameters in a middle range table 61 a motor proteins that attach to receptors on vesicles can walk the vesicles along microtubules or in some cases along microfilaments b in this sem of a squid giant axon a nerve cell extension two vesicles containing neurotransmitters move toward the axons tip,the cytoskeleton is a network of fibers in eukaryotic cells that organizes structures and activities within the cell it is made up of three types of molecular structures microtubules microfilaments also known as actin filaments and intermediate filaments key functions support the cytoskeleton provides mechanical support maintaining the cells shape it is crucial in animal cells which lack cell walls anchorage the cytoskeleton helps anchor organelles and enzymes in the cytosol keeping them in place motility it aids in cell movement and the movement of cell parts motor proteins interact with cytoskeletal fibers to allow vesicles and organelles to walk along the cytoskeleton to their destinations as seen in nerve cells where vesicles move along the axon components microtubules the thickest fibers involved in maintaining cell shape and serving as tracks for organelle movement microfilaments the thinnest fibers composed of actin involved in muscle contraction and other movement processes intermediate filaments fibers with intermediate diameters that provide strength and structure the cytoskeleton is dynamic allowing the cell to reorganize and change shape by assembling and disassembling its fibers
microtubules all eukaryotic cells have microtubules hollow rods constructed from a globular protein called tubulin each tubulin protein is a dimer a molecule made up of two subunits a tubulin dimer consists of two slightly different polypeptides tubulin and tubulin microtubules grow in length by adding tubulin dimers they can also be disassembled and their tubulin used to build microtubules elsewhere in the cell because of the orientation of tubulin dimers the two ends of a microtubule are slightly different one end can accumulate or release tubulin dimers at a much higher rate than the other thus growing and shrinking significantly during cellular activities this is called the plus end not because it can only add tubulin proteins but because its the end where both on and off rates are much higher microtubules shape and support the cell and also serve as tracks along which organelles equipped with motor proteins can move in addition to the example in figure 621 microtubules guide vesicles from the er to the golgi apparatus and from the golgi to the plasma membrane microtubules are also involved in the separation of chromosomes during cell division which will be discussed in chapter 12 centrosomes and centrioles in animal cells microtubules grow out from a centrosome a region that is often located near the nucleus these microtubules function as compressionresisting girders of the cytoskeleton within the centrosome is a pair of centrioles each composed of nine sets of triplet microtubules arranged in a ring figure 622 although centrosomes with centrioles may help organize microtubule assembly in animal cells many other eukaryotic cells lack centrosomes with centrioles and instead organize microtubules by other means cilia and flagella in eukaryotes a specialized arrangement of microtubules is responsible for the beating of flagella singular flagellum and cilia singular cilium microtubulecontaining extensions that project from some cells the bacterial flagellum shown in figure 65 has a completely different structure many unicellular eukaryotes are propelled through water by cilia or flagella that act as locomotor appendages and the sperm of animals algae and some plants have flagella when cilia or flagella extend from cells that are held in place as part of a tissue layer they can move fluid over the surface of the tissue for example the ciliated lining of the trachea windpipe sweeps mucus containing trapped debris out of the lungs see the ems in figure 63 in a womans reproductive tract the cilia lining the oviducts help move an egg toward the uterus motile cilia usually occur in large numbers on the cell surface flagella are usually limited to just one or a few per cell and they are longer than cilia flagella and cilia differ in their beating patterns figure 623 a flagellum has an undulating motion like the tail of a fish in contrast cilia work more like oars with alternating power and recovery strokes much like the oars of a racing crew boat a cilium may also act as a signalreceiving antenna for the cell cilia that have this function are generally nonmotile and there is only one per cell in fact in vertebrate animals it appears that almost all cells have such a cilium which is called a primary cilium membrane proteins on this kind of cilium transmit molecular signals from the cells environment to its interior triggering signaling pathways that may lead to changes in the cells activities ciliumbased signaling appears to be crucial to brain function and to embryonic development though different in length number per cell and beating pattern motile cilia and flagella share a common structure each motile cilium or flagellum has a group of microtubules sheathed in an extension of the plasma membrane figure 624a nine doublets of microtubules are arranged in a ring with two single microtubules in its center figure 624b this arrangement referred to as the 9 2 pattern is found in nearly all eukaryotic flagella and motile cilia nonmotile primary cilia have a 9 0 pattern lacking the central pair of microtubules the microtubule assembly of a cilium or flagellum is anchored in the cell by a basal body which is structurally very similar to a centriole with microtubule triplets in a 9 0 pattern figure 624c in fact in many animals including humans the basal body of the fertilizing sperms flagellum enters the egg and becomes a centriole how does the microtubule assembly produce the bending movements of flagella and motile cilia bending involves large motor proteins called dyneins red in the diagram in figure 624 that are attached along each outer microtubule doublet a typical dynein protein has two feet that walk along the microtubule of the adjacent doublet using atp for energy one foot maintains contact while the other releases and reattaches one step farther along the microtubule see figure 621 the outer doublets and two central microtubules are held together by flexible crosslinking proteins blue in the diagram in figure 624 and the walking movement is coordinated so that it happens on one side of the circle at a time if the doublets were not held in place the walking action would make them slide past each other instead the movements of the dynein feet cause the microtubulesand the organelle as a wholeto bend a motion of flagella a flagellum usually undulates its snakelike motion driving a cell in the same direction as the axis of the flagellum propulsion of a human sperm cell is an example of flagellate locomotion lm b motion of cilia cilia have a backandforth motion the rapid power stroke moves the cell in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the cilium then during the slower recovery stroke the cilium bends and sweeps sideways closer to the cell surface a dense nap of cilia beating at a rate of about 40 to 60 strokes a second covers this colpidium a freshwater protist colorized sem,microtubules are hollow cylindrical structures made of tubulin protein dimers which consist of two subunits tubulin and tubulin these microtubules can grow or shrink by adding or removing tubulin dimers primarily at the more dynamic plus end they provide essential structural support for the cell shaping it and creating tracks along which organelles move using motor proteins microtubules also play a crucial role in cell division by helping to separate chromosomes in animal cells microtubules grow from a region called the centrosome which contains a pair of centrioles additionally specialized structures like cilia and flagella are composed of microtubules these are involved in cellular movement or the movement of fluids over tissues flagella move with a wavelike undulating motion while cilia exhibit a more rhythmic oarlike motion both structures have a characteristic 9 2 arrangement of microtubules and are powered by dynein motor proteins which cause bending through coordinated movement primary cilia though nonmotile serve as important sensory organelles that help cells detect and respond to environmental signals
microfilaments actin filaments microfilaments are thin solid rods they are also called actin filaments because they are built from molecules of actin a globular protein a microfilament is a twisted double chain of actin subunits see table 61 besides occurring as linear filaments microfilaments can form structural networks when certain proteins bind along the side of such a filament and allow a new filament to extend as a branch like microtubules microfilaments seem to be present in all eukaryotic cells in contrast to the compressionresisting role of microtubules the structural role of microfilaments in the cytoskeleton is to bear tension pulling forces a threedimensional network formed by microfilaments just inside the plasma membrane cortical microfilaments helps support the cells shape see figure 68 this network gives the outer cytoplasmic layer of a cell called the cortex the semisolid consistency of a gel in contrast with the more fluid state of the interior cytoplasm in some kinds of animal cells such as nutrientabsorbing intestinal cells bundles of microfilaments make up the core of microvilli delicate projections that increase the cells surface area figure 625 microfilaments are well known for their role in cell motility thousands of actin filaments and thicker filaments made of a protein called myosin interact to cause contraction of muscle cells figure 626a muscle contraction is described in detail in chapter 50 in the unicellular eukaryote amoeba and some of our white blood cells localized contractions brought about by actin and myosin are involved in the amoeboid crawling movement of the cells figure 626b the cell crawls along a surface by extending cellular extensions called pseudopodia from the greek pseudes false and pod foot and moving toward them in plant cells both actinmyosin interactions contribute to cytoplasmic streaming a circular flow of cytoplasm within cells figure 626c this movement which is especially common in large plant cells speeds the distribution of materials within the cell a a longitudinal section of a motile cilium shows microtubules running the length of the membranesheathed structure tem b a cross section through a motile cilium shows the 9 2 arrangement of microtubules tem the outer microtubule doublets are held together with the two central microtubules by flexible crosslinking proteins blue in art including the radial spokes the doublets also have attached motor proteins called dyneins red in art c basal body the nine outer doublets of a cilium or flagellum extend into the basal body where each doublet joins another microtubule to form a ring of nine triplets each triplet is connected to the next by nontubulin proteins thinner blue lines in diagram this is a 9 0 arrangement the two central microtubules are not present because they terminate above the basal body tem intermediate filaments intermediate filaments are named for their diameter which is larger than the diameter of microfilaments but smaller than that of microtubules see table 61 unlike microtubules and microfilaments which are found in all eukaryotic cells intermediate filaments are only found in the cells of some animals including vertebrates specialized for bearing tension like microfilaments intermediate filaments are a diverse class of cytoskeletal elements each type is constructed from a particular molecular subunit belonging to a family of proteins whose members include the keratins microtubules and microfilaments in contrast are consistent in diameter and composition in all eukaryotic cells intermediate filaments are more permanent fixtures of cells than are microfilaments and microtubules which are often disassembled and reassembled in various parts of a cell even after cells die intermediate filament networks often persist for example the outer layer of our skin consists of dead skin cells full of keratin filaments chemical treatments that remove microfilaments and microtubules from the cytoplasm of living cells leave a web of intermediate filaments that retains its original shape such experiments suggest that intermediate filaments are especially sturdy and that they play an important role in reinforcing the shape of a cell and fixing the position of certain organelles for instance the nucleus typically sits within a cage made of intermediate filaments fixed in location by branches of the filaments that extend into the cytoplasm other intermediate filaments make up the nuclear lamina which lines the interior of the nuclear envelope see figure 69 by supporting a cells shape intermediate filaments help the cell carry out its specific function for example the network of intermediate filaments shown in figure 625 anchor the microfilaments supporting the intestinal microvilli thus the various kinds of intermediate filaments may function together as the permanent framework of the entire cell a myosin motors in muscle cell contraction the walking of myosin projections the socalled heads drives the parallel myosin and actin filaments past each other so that the actin filaments approach each other in the middle red arrows this shortens the muscle cell muscle contraction involves the shortening of many muscle cells at the same time tem b amoeboid movement interaction of actin filaments with myosin causes contraction of the cell pulling the cells trailing end at left forward to the right lm c cytoplasmic streaming in plant cells a layer of cytoplasm cycles around the cell moving over a carpet of parallel actin filaments myosin motors attached to organelles in the fluid cytosol may drive the streaming by interacting with the actin lm,microfilaments also called actin filaments are thin solid rods composed of the protein actin these filaments form twisted double chains and are essential in all eukaryotic cells for bearing tension pulling forces supporting the cells structure and shaping the outer cytoplasmic layer known as the cortex they also play a crucial role in cell motility working alongside myosin proteins to enable movement in muscle cells the interaction between actin and myosin results in muscle contraction in other cells like amoebas and white blood cells this interaction facilitates amoeboid movement by extending pseudopodia which allow cells to crawl in plants microfilaments drive cytoplasmic streaming helping distribute materials within large cells intermediate filaments are more robust and stable than microfilaments and microtubules made of proteins like keratin they provide permanent structural support helping to maintain cell shape and fix the position of key organelles such as the nucleus intermediate filaments form the nuclear lamina which lines the inside of the nuclear envelope and support other cellular structures like intestinal microvilli unlike microfilaments and microtubules intermediate filaments remain intact even after cell death making them crucial for longterm cellular integrity
extracellular components and connections between cells help coordinate cellular activities having crisscrossed the cell to explore its interior components we complete our tour of the cell by returning to the surface of this microscopic world where there are additional structures with important functions the plasma membrane is usually regarded as the boundary of the living cell but most cells synthesize and secrete materials that are then extracellular or external to the plasma membrane although these materials and the structures they form are outside the cell their study is important to cell biology because they are involved in a great many important cellular functions cell walls of plants the cell wall is an extracellular structure of plant cells that distinguishes them from animal cells see figure 68 the wall protects the plant cell maintains its shape and prevents excessive uptake of water on the level of the whole plant the strong walls of specialized cells hold the plant up against the force of gravity prokaryotes fungi and some unicellular eukaryotes also have cell walls as you saw in figures 65 and 68 but we will postpone discussion of them until unit five plant cell walls are much thicker than the plasma membrane ranging from 01 m to several micrometers the exact chemical composition of the wall varies from species to species and even from one cell type to another in the same plant but the basic design of the wall is consistent microfibrils made of the polysaccharide cellulose see figure 56 are synthesized by an enzyme called cellulose synthase and secreted to the extracellular space where they become embedded in a matrix of other polysaccharides and proteins this combination of materials strong fibers in a ground substance matrix is the same basic architectural design found in steelreinforced concrete and in fiberglass a young plant cell first secretes a relatively thin and flexible wall called the primary cell wall figure 627 between primary walls of adjacent cells is the middle lamella a thin layer rich in sticky polysaccharides called pectins the middle lamella glues adjacent cells together pectin is used in cooking as a thickening agent in jams and jellies when the cell matures and stops growing it strengthens its wall some plant cells do this simply by secreting hardening substances into the primary wall other cells add a secondary cell wall between the plasma membrane and the primary wall the secondary wall often deposited in several laminated layers has a strong and durable matrix that affords the cell protection and support wood for example consists mainly of secondary walls plant cell walls are usually perforated by channels between adjacent cells called plasmodesmata see figure 627 which will be discussed shortly the extracellular matrix ecm of animal cells although animal cells lack walls akin to those of plant cells they do have an elaborate extracellular matrix ecm the main ingredients of the ecm are glycoproteins and other carbohydratecontaining molecules secreted by the cells recall that glycoproteins are proteins with covalently bonded carbohydrates usually short chains of sugars the most abundant glycoprotein in the ecm of most animal cells is collagen which forms strong fibers outside the cells see figure 518 in fact collagen accounts for about 40 of the total protein in the human body the collagen fibers are embedded in a network woven out of proteoglycans secreted by cells figure 628 a proteoglycan molecule consists of a small core protein with many carbohydrate chains covalently attached so that it may be up to 95 carbohydrate large proteoglycan complexes can form when hundreds of proteoglycan molecules become noncovalently attached to a single long polysaccharide molecule as shown in figure 628 some cells are attached to the ecm by ecm glycoproteins such as fibronectin fibronectin and other ecm proteins bind to cellsurface receptor proteins called integrins that are built into the plasma membrane integrins span the membrane and bind on their cytoplasmic side to associated proteins attached to microfilaments of the cytoskeleton the name integrin is based on the word integrate integrins are in a position to transmit signals between the ecm and the cytoskeleton and thus to integrate changes occurring outside and inside the cell current research on fibronectin other ecm molecules and integrins is revealing the influential role of the ecm in the lives of cells by communicating with a cell through integrins the ecm can regulate a cells behavior for example some cells in a developing embryo migrate along specific pathways by matching the orientation of their microfilaments to the grain of fibers in the extracellular matrix researchers have also learned that the extracellular matrix around a cell can influence the activity of genes in the nucleus information about the ecm probably reaches the nucleus by a combination of mechanical and chemical signaling pathways mechanical signaling involves fibronectin integrins and microfilaments of the cytoskeleton changes in the cytoskeleton may in turn trigger chemical signaling pathways inside the cell leading to changes in the set of proteins being made by the cell and therefore changes in the cells function in this way the extracellular matrix of a particular tissue may help coordinate the behavior of all the cells of that tissue direct connections between cells also function in this coordination as we discuss next,extracellular components and cell connections play crucial roles in coordinating cellular activities in plant cells the cell wall is a thick structure that surrounds the plasma membrane providing protection and maintaining shape while preventing excessive water intake composed mainly of cellulose fibers embedded in a matrix of polysaccharides and proteins it consists of a primary cell wall in young cells and a more rigid secondary cell wall in mature cells the middle lamella glues adjacent cells together while plasmodesmata are channels that allow communication and transport between them in contrast animal cells possess an extracellular matrix ecm made primarily of glycoproteins such as collagen which provides structural support proteoglycans form a network within the ecm enhancing its stability cells attach to the ecm through fibronectin and integrinsproteins that span the cell membrane and connect the ecm to the cytoskeleton integrins facilitate communication between the ecm and the cell regulating behavior and influencing gene expression this interaction allows the ecm to coordinate the functions of cells within tissues highlighting its significance in cellular communication and organization
cell junctions cells in an animal or plant are organized into tissues organs and organ systems neighboring cells often adhere interact and communicate via sites of direct physical contact plasmodesmata in plant cells it might seem that the nonliving cell walls of plants would isolate plant cells from one another but in fact as shown in figure 629 cell walls are perforated with plasmodesmata singular plasmodesma from the greek desma bond channels that connect cells cytosol passing through the plasmodesmata joins the internal chemical environments of adjacent cells these connections unify most of the plant into one living continuum the plasma membranes of adjacent cells line the channel of each plasmodesma and thus are continuous water and small solutes can pass freely from cell to cell and several experiments have shown that in some circumstances certain proteins and rna molecules can do this as well see concept 366 the macromolecules transported to neighboring cells appear to reach the plasmodesmata by moving along fibers of the cytoskeleton tight junctions desmosomes and gap junctions in animal cells in animals there are three main types of cell junctions tight junctions desmosomes and gap junctions gap junctions are most like the plasmodesmata of plants although gap junction pores are not lined with membrane all three types of cell junctions are especially common in epithelial tissue which lines the external and internal surfaces of the body figure 630 uses epithelial cells of the intestinal lining to illustrate these junctions tight junctions at tight junctions the plasma membranes of neighboring cells are very tightly pressed against each other bound together by specific proteins purple forming continuous seals around the cells tight junctions establish a barrier that prevents leakage of extracellular fluid across a layer of epithelial cells see red dashed arrow for example tight junctions between skin cells make us watertight desmosomes desmosomes also called anchoring junctions function like rivets fastening cells together into strong sheets intermediate filaments made of sturdy keratin proteins anchor desmosomes in the cytoplasm desmosomes attach muscle cells to each other in a muscle some muscle tears involve the rupture of desmosomes gap junctions gap junctions also called communicating junctions provide cytoplasmic channels from one cell to an adjacent cell and in this way are similar in their function to the plasmodesmata in plants gap junctions consist of membrane proteins that surround a pore through which ions sugars amino acids and other small molecules may pass gap junctions are necessary for communication between cells in many types of tissues such as heart muscle and in animal embryos the cell a living unit greater than the sum of its parts from our panoramic view of the cells compartmental organization to our closeup inspection of each organelles architecture this tour of the cell has provided many opportunities to correlate structure with function this would be a good time to review cell structure by returning to figure 68 but even as we dissect the cell remember that none of its components works alone as an example of cellular integration consider the microscopic scene in figure 631 the large cell is a macrophage see figure 613a it helps defend the mammalian body against infections by ingesting bacteria the smaller cells into phagocytic vesicles the macrophage crawls along a surface and reaches out to the bacteria with thin pseudopodia specifically filopodia actin filaments interact with other elements of the cytoskeleton in these movements after the macrophage engulfs the bacteria they are destroyed by lysosomes the elaborate endomembrane system produces the lysosomes the digestive enzymes of the lysosomes and the proteins of the cytoskeleton are all made by ribosomes and the synthesis of these proteins is programmed by genetic messages dispatched from the dna in the nucleus all these processes require energy which mitochondria supply in the form of atp cellular functions arise from cellular order the cell is a living unit greater than the sum of its parts,cells in both plants and animals form organized structures like tissues and organs through various types of connections plasmodesmata these are channels in plant cell walls that connect neighboring cells allowing the free passage of water small solutes and sometimes proteins and rna this creates a unified living continuum among plant cells animal cell junctions there are three primary types tight junctions these tightly bind adjacent cells preventing leakage of extracellular fluid thereby maintaining a watertight barrier eg in skin cells desmosomes known as anchoring junctions they act like rivets fastening cells into strong sheets and providing structural integrity especially in muscles gap junctions these are channels that facilitate communication between cells allowing the passage of ions and small molecules crucial in tissues like heart muscle overall the cell functions as a cohesive unit where components interact seamlessly for instance macrophages utilize various cellular structures to engulf and destroy pathogens demonstrating that cellular functions arise from integrated systems working together harmoniously
cellular membranes are fluid mosaics of lipids and proteins lipids and proteins are the staple ingredients of membranes although carbohydrates are also important the most abundant lipids in most membranes are phospholipids the ability of phospholipids to form membranes is inherent in their molecular structure a phospholipid is an amphipathic molecule meaning it has both a hydrophilic region and a hydrophobic region see figure 511 other types of membrane lipids are also amphipathic a phospholipid bilayer can exist as a stable boundary between two aqueous compartments because the molecular arrangement shelters the hydrophobic tails of the phospholipids from water while exposing the hydrophilic heads to water figure 72 like membrane lipids most membrane proteins are amphipathic such proteins can reside in the phospholipid bilayer with their hydrophilic regions protruding this molecular orientation maximizes contact of hydrophilic regions of proteins with water in the cytosol and extracellular fluid while providing their hydrophobic parts with a nonaqueous environment figure 73 shows the currently accepted model of the arrangement of molecules in the plasma membrane in this fluid mosaic model the membrane is a mosaic of protein molecules bobbing in a fluid bilayer of phospholipids parts with a nonaqueous environment figure 73 shows the currently accepted model of the arrangement of molecules in the plasma membrane in this fluid mosaic model the membrane is a mosaic of protein molecules bobbing in a fluid bilayer of phospholipids the proteins are not randomly distributed in the membrane however groups of proteins are often associated in longlasting specialized patches where they carry out common functions the lipids themselves appear to form defined regions as well also in some regions the membrane may be much more packed with proteins than shown in figure 73 like all models the fluid mosaic model is continually being refined as new research reveals more about membrane structure the fluidity of membranes membranes are not static sheets of molecules locked rigidly in place a membrane is held together primarily by hydrophobic interactions which are much weaker than covalent bonds see figure 518 most of the lipids and some of the proteins can shift about laterallythat is in the plane of the membrane like partygoers elbowing their way through a crowded room very rarely also a lipid may flipflop across the membrane switching from one phospholipid layer to the other the lateral movement of phospholipids within the membrane is rapid adjacent phospholipids switch positions about 107 times per second which means that a phospholipid can travel about 2 mthe length of many bacterial cellsin 1 second proteins are much larger than lipids and move more slowly but some membrane proteins do drift as shown in a classic experiment described in figure 74 some membrane proteins seem to move in a highly directed manner perhaps driven along cytoskeletal fibers in the cell by motor proteins connected to the membrane proteins cytoplasmic regions however many other membrane proteins seem to be held immobile by their attachment to the cytoskeleton or to the extracellular matrix see figure 73 a membrane remains fluid as temperature decreases until the phospholipids settle into a closely packed arrangement and the membrane solidifies much as bacon grease forms lard when it cools the temperature at which a membrane solidifies depends on the types of lipids it is made of the membrane remains fluid to a lower temperature if it is rich in phospholipids with unsaturated hydrocarbon tails see figures 510 and 511 because of kinks in the tails where double bonds are located unsaturated hydrocarbon tails cannot pack together as closely as saturated hydrocarbon tails making the membrane more fluid figure 75a the steroid cholesterol which is wedged between phospholipid molecules in the plasma membranes of animal cells has different effects on membrane fluidity at different temperatures figure 75b at relatively high temperatures at 37c the body temperature of humans for example cholesterol makes the membrane less fluid by restraining phospholipid movement however because cholesterol also hinders the close packing of phospholipids it lowers the temperature required for the membrane to solidify thus cholesterol can be thought of as a fluidity buffer for the membrane resisting changes in membrane fluidity that can be caused by changes in temperature membranes must be fluid to work properly the fluidity of a membrane affects both its permeability and the ability of membrane proteins to move to where their function is needed usually membranes are about as fluid as salad oil when a membrane solidifies its permeability changes and enzymatic proteins in the membrane may become inactive if their activity requires movement within the membrane however membranes that are too fluid cannot support protein function either therefore extreme environments pose a challenge for life resulting in evolutionary adaptations that include differences in membrane lipid composition,cellular membranes are dynamic structures composed of lipids and proteins primarily phospholipids which are amphipathic molecules featuring both hydrophilic waterattracting and hydrophobic waterrepelling regions this unique structure allows phospholipids to arrange themselves into a bilayer creating a stable barrier between aqueous environments fluid mosaic model this model describes membranes as a mosaic of protein molecules floating in a fluid phospholipid bilayer where proteins are not randomly distributed but often cluster into functional patches membrane fluidity membranes are fluid held together by weak hydrophobic interactions phospholipids can move laterally with rapid lateral movement while proteins may move more slowly or remain anchored membrane fluidity is affected by temperature and lipid composition unsaturated fatty acids enhance fluidity while cholesterol acts as a fluidity buffer stabilizing the membrane across varying temperatures importance of fluidity membrane fluidity is essential for proper function affecting permeability and the mobility of proteins too much rigidity or fluidity can hinder enzyme activity and overall cell function
evolution of differences in membrane lipid composition evolution variations in the cell membrane lipid compositions of many species appear to be evolutionary adaptations that maintain the appropriate membrane fluidity under specific environmental conditions for instance fishes that live in extreme cold have membranes with a high proportion of unsaturated hydrocarbon tails enabling their membranes to remain fluid see figure 75a at the other extreme some bacteria and archaea thrive at temperatures greater than 90c 194f in thermal hot springs and geysers their membranes include unusual lipids that may prevent excessive fluidity at such high temperatures the ability to change the lipid composition of cell membranes in response to changing temperatures has evolved in organisms that live where temperatures vary in many plants that tolerate extreme cold such as winter wheat the percentage of unsaturated phospholipids increases in autumn an adjustment that keeps the membranes from solidifying during winter certain bacteria and archaea can also change the proportion of unsaturated phospholipids in their cell membranes depending on the temperature at which they are growing overall natural selection has apparently favored organisms whose mix of membrane lipids ensures an appropriate level of membrane fluidity for their environment membrane proteins and their functions now we come to the mosaic aspect of the fluid mosaic model somewhat like a tile mosaic a membrane is a collage of different proteins often clustered together in groups embedded in the fluid matrix of the lipid bilayer see figure 73 in the plasma membrane of red blood cells alone for example more than 50 kinds of proteins have been found so far phospholipids form the main fabric of the membrane but proteins determine most of the membranes functions different types of cells contain different sets of membrane proteins and the various membranes within a cell each have a unique collection of proteins notice in figure 73 that there are two major populations of membrane proteins integral proteins and peripheral proteins integral proteins penetrate the hydrophobic interior of the lipid bilayer the majority are transmembrane proteins which span the membrane other integral proteins extend only partway into the hydrophobic interior the hydrophobic regions of an integral protein consist of one or more stretches of nonpolar amino acids see figure 514 usually coiled into helices figure 76 the hydrophilic parts of the molecule are exposed to the aqueous solutions on either side of the membrane some proteins also have one or more hydrophilic channels that allow passage through the membrane of hydrophilic substances even of water itself see figure 71 peripheral proteins are not embedded in the lipid bilayer at all they are appendages loosely bound to the surface of the membrane often to exposed parts of integral proteins see figure 73 on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane some membrane proteins are held in place by attachment to the cytoskeleton and on the extracellular side certain membrane proteins are attached to fibers of the extracellular matrix see figure 628 integrins are one type of integral transmembrane protein these attachments combine to give animal cells a stronger framework than the plasma membrane alone could provide a single cell may have cell surface membrane proteins that carry out several different functions such as transport through the cell membrane enzymatic activity or attaching a cell to either a neighboring cell or the extracellular matrix furthermore a single membrane protein may itself carry out multiple functions thus the membrane is not only a structural mosaic but also a functional mosaic figure 77 illustrates six major functions performed by proteins of the plasma membrane proteins on a cells surface are important in the medical field for example a protein called cd4 on the surface of immune cells helps the human immunodeficiency virus hiv infect these cells leading to acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids despite multiple exposures to hiv however a small number of people do not develop aids and show no evidence of hivinfected cells comparing their genes with the genes of infected individuals researchers learned that resistant people have an unusual form of a gene that codes for an immune cellsurface protein called ccr5 further work showed although cd4 is the main hiv receptor hiv must also bind to ccr5 as a coreceptor to infect most cells figure 78a an absence of ccr5 on the cells of resistant individuals due to the gene alteration prevents the virus from entering the cells figure 78b this information has been key to developing a treatment for hiv infection interfering with cd4 could cause dangerous side effects because it performs many important functions in cells discovery of the ccr5 coreceptor provided a safer target for development of drugs that mask this protein and block hiv entry one such drug maraviroc brand name selzentry was approved for treatment of hiv in 2007 and is still being used today a clinical trial began in 2012 to test whether this drug might also work to prevent hiv infection in uninfected atrisk patients atransport left a protein that spans the membrane may provide a hydrophilic channel across the membrane that is selective for a particular solute right other transport proteins shuttle a substance from one side to the other by changing shape see figure 714b some of these proteins hydrolyze atp as an energy source to actively pump substances across the membrane benzymatic activity a protein built into the membrane may be an enzyme with its active site exposed to substances in the adjacent solution in some cases several enzymes in a membrane are organized as a team that carries out sequential steps of a metabolic pathway csignal transduction a membrane protein receptor may have a binding site with a specific shape that fits the shape of a chemical messenger such as a hormone the external messenger signaling molecule may cause the protein to change shape allowing it to relay the message to the inside of the cell usually by binding to a cytoplasmic protein see figure 116 dcellcell recognition some glycoproteins serve as identification tags that are specifically recognized by membrane proteins of other cells this type of cellcell binding is usually shortlived compared to that shown in e eintercellular joining membrane proteins of adjacent cells may hook together in various kinds of junctions such as gap junctions or tight junctions see figure 630 this type of binding is more longlasting than that shown in d f signaling molecule signal transduction receptor glycoprotein attachment to the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix ecm microfilaments or other elements of the cytoskeleton may be noncovalently bound to membrane proteins a function that helps maintain cell shape and stabilizes the location of certain membrane proteins proteins that can bind to ecm molecules can coordinate extracellular and intracellular changes synthesis and sidedness of membranes membranes have distinct inside and outside faces the two lipid layers may differ in lipid composition and each protein has directional orientation in the membrane see figure 76 figure 79 shows how membrane sidedness arises the asymmetrical arrangement of proteins lipids and their associated carbohydrates in the plasma membrane is determined as the membrane is being built by the endoplasmic reticulum er and golgi apparatus components of the endomembrane system see figure 615,the evolution of membrane lipid composition in various organisms is a key adaptation that allows cells to maintain appropriate fluidity under different environmental conditions for example fish living in cold waters have a higher proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in their membranes keeping them fluid while certain bacteria and archaea in extreme heat possess unique lipids to prevent excessive fluidity plants like winter wheat adjust their lipid composition seasonally to avoid membrane solidification during winter membrane proteins play crucial roles in cellular function categorized as integral proteins which span the membrane and peripheral proteins which are attached loosely to the membranes surface these proteins are involved in several functions including transport moving substances across the membrane through hydrophilic channels or shape changes enzymatic activity acting as enzymes exposed to the surrounding solution signal transduction relaying messages from external signals through conformational changes cellcell recognition serving as identification tags for cell interactions intercellular joining forming junctions between adjacent cells attachment binding to the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix to maintain structure membrane composition and protein orientation are established during the synthesis of membranes by the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus contributing to their distinct inside and outside faces
membrane structure results in selective permeability the biological membrane is an exquisite example of a supramolecular structuremany molecules ordered into a higher level of organizationwith emergent properties beyond those of the individual molecules the remainder of this chapter focuses on one of those properties the ability to regulate transport across cellular boundaries a function essential to the cells existence we will see once again that form fits function the fluid mosaic model helps explain how membranes regulate the cells molecular traffic a steady traffic of small molecules and ions moves across the plasma membrane in both directions consider the chemical exchanges between a muscle cell and the extracellular fluid that bathes it sugars amino acids and other nutrients enter the cell and metabolic waste products leave it the cell takes in o2 for use in cellular respiration and expels co2 also the cell regulates its concentrations of inorganic ions such as na k ca2 and cl by shuttling them one way or the other across the plasma membrane although the heavy traffic through them may seem to suggest otherwise cell membranes are selectively permeable and substances do not cross the barrier indiscriminately the cell is able to take up some small molecules and ions and exclude others membrane proteins and lipids are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum er carbohydrates green are added to the transmembrane proteins purple dumbbells making them glycoproteins the carbohydrate portions may then be modified inside the golgi apparatus the glycoproteins undergo further carbohydrate modification and lipids acquire carbohydrates becoming glycolipids the glycoproteins glycolipids and secretory proteins purple spheres are transported in vesicles to the plasma membrane as vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane the outside face of the vesicle becomes continuous with the inside cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane this releases the secretory proteins from the cell a process called exocytosis and positions the carbohydrates of membrane glycoproteins and glycolipids on the outside extracellular face of the plasma membrane the permeability of the lipid bilayer nonpolar molecules such as hydrocarbons co2 and o2 are hydrophobic they can therefore dissolve in the lipid bilayer of the membrane and cross it easily without the aid of membrane proteins however the hydrophobic interior of the membrane impedes direct passage through the membrane of ions and polar molecules which are hydrophilic polar molecules such as glucose and other sugars pass only slowly through a lipid bilayer and even water a very small polar molecule does not cross rapidly a charged atom or molecule and its surrounding shell of water see figure 37 are even less likely to penetrate the hydrophobic interior of the membrane furthermore the lipid bilayer is only one aspect of the gatekeeper system responsible for a cells selective permeability proteins built into the membrane play key roles in regulating transport transport proteins specific ions and a variety of polar molecules cant move through cell membranes on their own however these hydrophilic substances can avoid contact with the lipid bilayer by passing through transport proteins that span the membrane some transport proteins called channel proteins function by having a hydrophilic channel that certain molecules or atomic ions use as a tunnel through the membrane see figure 77a left for example the passage of water molecules through the membrane in certain cells is greatly facilitated by channel proteins known as aquaporins see figure 71 each aquaporin allows entry of up to 3 billion 3 109 water molecules per second passing single file through its central channel which fits ten at a time without aquaporins only a tiny fraction of these water molecules would pass through the same area of the cell membrane in a second so the channel protein brings about a tremendous increase in rate other transport proteins called carrier proteins hold onto their passengers and change shape in a way that shuttles them across the membrane see figure 77a right a transport protein is specific for the substance it translocates moves allowing only a certain substance or a small group of related substances to cross the membrane for example a specific carrier protein in the plasma membrane of red blood cells transports glucose across the membrane 50000 times faster than glucose can pass through on its own this glucose transporter is so selective that it even rejects fructose a structural isomer of glucose thus the selective permeability of a membrane depends on both the discriminating barrier of the lipid bilayer and the specific transport proteins built into the membrane but what establishes the direction of traffic across a membrane at a given time what determines whether a particular substance will enter the cell or leave the cell and what mechanisms actually drive molecules across membranes we will address these questions next as we explore two modes of membrane traffic passive transport and active transport,biological membranes exemplify supramolecular structures with selective permeability crucial for regulating transport across cellular boundaries the fluid mosaic model illustrates how membranes control molecular traffic allowing essential substances to enter and waste products to exit cells membrane proteins and lipids are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum er and modified in the golgi apparatus before being transported to the plasma membrane via vesicles this process includes the formation of glycoproteins and glycolipids membrane permeability varies for different substances nonpolar molecules eg hydrocarbons co2 o2 can easily cross the lipid bilayer due to their hydrophobic nature while ions and polar molecules struggle to penetrate it transport proteins are essential for moving hydrophilic substances across the membrane channel proteins form hydrophilic channels that allow specific molecules such as water via aquaporins to pass through carrier proteins bind to specific substances and change shape to shuttle them across the membrane the membranes selective permeability relies on both the lipid bilayers properties and the specificity of transport proteins the direction of substance movement across membranes is determined by passive and active transport mechanisms
passive transport is diffusion of a substance across a membrane with no energy investment molecules have a type of energy called thermal energy due to their constant motion see concept 32 one result of this motion is diffusion the movement of particles of any substance so that they spread out into the available space each molecule moves randomly yet diffusion of a population of molecules may be directional to understand this process lets imagine a synthetic membrane separating pure water from a solution of a dye in water study figure 710a carefully to appreciate how diffusion would result in both solutions having equal concentrations of the dye molecules once that point is reached there will be a dynamic equilibrium with roughly as many dye molecules crossing the membrane each second in one direction as in the other a diffusion of one solute the membrane has pores large enough for molecules of dye to pass through random movement of dye molecules will cause some to pass through the pores this will happen more often on the side with more dye molecules the dye diffuses from where it is more concentrated to where it is less concentrated called diffusing down a concentration gradient this leads to a dynamic equilibrium the solute molecules continue to cross the membrane but at roughly equal rates in both directions b diffusion of two solutes solutions of two different dyes are separated by a membrane that is permeable to both each dye diffuses down its own concentration gradient there will be a net diffusion of the purple dye toward the left even though the total solute concentration was initially greater on the left side we can now state a simple rule of diffusion in the absence of other forces a substance will diffuse from where it is more concentrated to where it is less concentrated put another way any substance will diffuse down its concentration gradient the region along which the density of a chemical substance increases or decreases in this case decreases no work must be done to make this happen diffusion is a spontaneous process needing no input of energy note that each substance diffuses down its own concentration gradient unaffected by the concentration gradients of other substances figure 710b much of the traffic across cell membranes occurs by diffusion when a substance is more concentrated on one side of a membrane than on the other there is a tendency for the substance to diffuse across the membrane down its concentration gradient assuming that the membrane is permeable to that substance one important example is the uptake of oxygen by a cell performing cellular respiration dissolved oxygen diffuses into the cell across the plasma membrane as long as cellular respiration consumes the o2 as it enters diffusion into the cell will continue because the concentration gradient favors movement in that direction the diffusion of a substance across a biological membrane is called passive transport because the cell does not have to expend energy to make it happen the concentration gradient itself represents potential energy see concept 22 and figure 85b and drives diffusion remember however that membranes are selectively permeable and therefore have different effects on the rates of diffusion of various molecules in the case of water aquaporins allow water to diffuse very rapidly across the membranes of certain cells as well see next the movement of water across the plasma membrane has important consequences for cells,passive transport refers to the movement of substances across a membrane without the expenditure of energy this process is largely driven by thermal energy which causes molecules to move randomly leading to diffusionthe spreading of particles from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration here are the key points about passive transport and diffusion diffusion process definition diffusion is the movement of molecules that results in equal concentrations across a space dynamic equilibrium once equal concentrations are achieved molecules continue to cross the membrane at equal rates in both directions resulting in a dynamic equilibrium concentration gradient a substance will naturally diffuse down its concentration gradientfrom areas of higher concentration to areas of lower concentrationwithout any energy input this spontaneous process occurs independently for each substance regardless of other substances present examples uptake of oxygen oxygen diffuses into cells where it is consumed for cellular respiration the concentration gradient favors this movement as long as oxygen is being used role of membranes membranes are selectively permeable affecting how different substances diffuse aquaporins these channel proteins facilitate rapid water diffusion in certain cells illustrating the selective permeability of membranes energy consideration no energy is required for passive transport the concentration gradient serves as a form of potential energy that drives the process
effects of osmosis on water balance to see how two solutions with different solute concentrations interact picture a ushaped glass tube with a selectively permeable artificial membrane separating two sugar solutions figure 711 pores in this synthetic membrane are too small for sugar molecules to pass through but large enough for water molecules however tight clustering of water molecules around the hydrophilic solute molecules makes some of the water unavailable to cross the membrane as a result the solution with a higher solute concentration has a lower free water concentration water diffuses across the membrane from the region of higher free water concentration lower solute concentration to that of lower free water concentration higher solute concentration until the solute concentrations on both sides of the membrane are more nearly equal the diffusion of free water across a selectively permeable membrane whether artificial or cellular is called osmosis the movement of water across cell membranes and the balance of water between the cell and its environment are crucial to organisms lets now apply what weve learned in this system to living cells water balance of cells without cell walls to explain the behavior of a cell in a solution we must consider both solute concentration and membrane permeability both factors are taken into account in the concept of tonicity the ability of a surrounding solution to cause a cell to gain or lose water the tonicity of a solution depends in part on its concentration of solutes that cannot cross the membrane nonpenetrating solutes relative to that inside the cell if there is a higher concentration of nonpenetrating solutes in the surrounding solution water will tend to leave the cell and vice versa if a cell without a cell wall such as an animal cell is immersed in an environment that is isotonic to the cell iso means same there will be no net movement of water across the plasma membrane water diffuses across the membrane but at the same rate in both directions in an isotonic environment the volume of an animal cell is stable figure 712a lets transfer the cell to a solution that is hypertonic to the cell hyper means more in this case referring to nonpenetrating solutes the cell will lose water shrivel and probably die this is why an increase in the salinity saltiness of a lake can kill the animals there if the lake water becomes hypertonic to the animals cells they might shrivel and die however taking up too much water can be just as hazardous as losing water if we place the cell in a solution that is hypotonic to the cell hypo means less water will enter the cell faster than it leaves and the cell will swell and lyse burst like an overfilled water balloon a cell without rigid cell walls can tolerate neither excessive uptake nor excessive loss of water this problem of water balance is automatically solved if such a cell lives in isotonic surroundings seawater is isotonic to many marine invertebrates the cells of most terrestrial landdwelling animals are bathed in an extracellular fluid that is isotonic to the cells in hypertonic or hypotonic environments however organisms that lack rigid cell walls must have other adaptations for osmoregulation the control of solute concentrations and water balance for example the unicellular protist paramecium caudatum lives in pond water which is hypotonic to the cell p caudatum has a plasma membrane that is much less permeable to water than the membranes of most other cells but this only slows the uptake of water which continually enters the cell the p caudatum cell doesnt burst because it is also equipped with a contractile vacuole an organelle that functions as a bilge pump to force water out of the cell as fast as it enters by osmosis figure 713 we will examine other evolutionary adaptations for osmoregulation in chapter 44 a animal cell an animal cell fares best in an isotonic environment unless it has special adaptations that offset the osmotic uptake or loss of water b plant cell plant cells are turgid firm and generally healthiest in a hypotonic environment where the uptake of water is eventually balanced by the wall pushing back on the cell water balance of cells with cell walls the cells of plants prokaryotes fungi and some protists are surrounded by cell walls see figure 627 when such a cell is immersed in a hypotonic solutionbathed in rainwater for examplethe cell wall helps maintain the cells water balance consider a plant cell like an animal cell the plant cell swells as water enters by osmosis figure 712b however the relatively inelastic cell wall will expand only so much before it exerts a back pressure on the cell called turgor pressure that opposes further water uptake at this point the cell is turgid very firm which is the healthy state for most plant cells plants that are not woody such as most houseplants depend for mechanical support on cells kept turgid by a surrounding hypotonic solution if a plants cells and their surroundings are isotonic there is no net tendency for water to enter and the cells become flaccid limp however a cell wall is of no advantage if the cell is immersed in a hypertonic environment in this case a plant cell like an animal cell will lose water to its surroundings and shrink as the plant cell shrivels its plasma membrane pulls away from the cell wall at multiple places this phenomenon called plasmolysis causes the plant to wilt and can lead to plant death the walled cells of bacteria and fungi also plasmolyze in hypertonic environments,osmosis is the diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane crucial for maintaining cellular water balance water moves from areas of higher free water concentration lower solute concentration to lower free water concentration higher solute concentration until equilibrium is reached tonicity describes how a solution affects cell water balance based on nonpenetrating solute concentrations isotonic solutions no net water movement occurs cells maintain stable volume hypertonic solutions higher external solute concentrations lead to water loss causing cells to shrivel hypotonic solutions lower external solute concentrations result in water influx potentially causing cells to swell and burst cells without walls like animal cells require isotonic conditions to prevent excessive water loss or gain in contrast plant cells have rigid walls that help maintain turgor pressure when placed in hypotonic solutions keeping them firm however in hypertonic solutions plant cells experience plasmolysis leading to wilting thus while cell walls provide significant advantages in water regulation organisms without them must employ osmoregulation mechanisms to survive in fluctuating environments
facilitated diffusion passive transport aided by proteins lets look more closely at how water and certain hydrophilic solutes cross a membrane as mentioned earlier many polar molecules and ions impeded by the lipid bilayer of the membrane diffuse passively with the help of transport proteins that span the membrane this phenomenon is called facilitated diffusion cell biologists are still trying to learn exactly how various transport proteins facilitate diffusion most transport proteins are very specific they transport some substances but not others as mentioned earlier the two types of transport proteins are channel proteins and carrier proteins channel proteins simply provide corridors that allow specific molecules or ions to cross the membrane figure 714a the hydrophilic passageways provided by these proteins can allow water molecules or small ions to diffuse very quickly from one side of the membrane to the other aquaporins the water channel proteins facilitate the massive amounts of diffusion that occur in plant cells and in animal cells such as red blood cells see figure 712 certain kidney cells also have a high number of aquaporins allowing them to reclaim water from urine before it is excreted if the kidneys did not perform this function you would excrete about 180 l of urine per dayand have to drink an equal volume of water channel proteins that transport ions are called ion channels many ion channels function as gated channels which open or close in response to a stimulus for some gated channels the stimulus is electrical in a nerve cell for example an ion channel opens in response to an electrical stimulus allowing a stream of potassium ions to leave the cell see the orange ion in the center of the ion channel shown at the bottom left of the chapteropening page this restores the cells ability to fire again other gated channels open or close when a specific substance other than the one to be transported binds to the channel these are also important in the functioning of the nervous system as youll learn in chapter 48 carrier proteins such as the glucose transporter mentioned earlier seem to undergo a subtle change in shape that somehow translocates the solutebinding site across the membrane figure 714b such a change in shape may be triggered by the binding and release of the transported molecule like ion channels carrier proteins involved in facilitated diffusion result in the net movement of a substance down its concentration gradient no energy input is thus required this is passive transport the scientific skills exercise gives you an opportunity to work with data from an experiment related to glucose transport,facilitated diffusion is a vital process allowing hydrophilic molecules and ions to cross the cell membrane without energy input this occurs with the assistance of specific transport proteins which facilitate the movement of substances that cannot easily penetrate the lipid bilayer due to their polar characteristics transport proteins there are two main types channel proteins these proteins form hydrophilic corridors that enable specific molecules to pass through the membrane rapidly for instance aquaporins are specialized channel proteins that facilitate the rapid diffusion of water crucial for maintaining water balance in cells additionally ion channels allow the passage of ions some of which function as gated channels opening in response to electrical stimuli such as in nerve cells allowing ions to flow in and out which is essential for nerve signal transmission carrier proteins these proteins bind to specific solutes such as glucose when a solute attaches the carrier protein undergoes a subtle conformational change that translocates the solutebinding site across the membrane this process also occurs down the concentration gradient where substances move from areas of higher concentration to lower concentration overall facilitated diffusion is an efficient passive transport mechanism crucial for maintaining cellular function as it allows the cell to regulate its internal environment without expending energy
active transport uses energy to move solutes against their gradients despite the help of transport proteins facilitated diffusion is considered passive transport because the solute is moving down its concentration gradient a process that requires no energy facilitated diffusion speeds transport of a solute by providing efficient passage through the membrane but it does not alter the direction of transport some other transport proteins however can move solutes against their concentration gradients across the plasma membrane from the side where they are less concentrated whether inside or outside to the side where they are more concentrated the need for energy in active transport to pump a solute across a membrane against its gradient requires work the cell must expend energy therefore this type of membrane traffic is called active transport the transport proteins that move solutes against their concentration gradients are all carrier proteins rather than channel proteins this makes sense because when channel proteins are open they merely allow solutes to diffuse down their concentration gradients rather than picking them up and transporting them against their gradients active transport enables a cell to maintain internal concentrations of small solutes that differ from concentrations in its environment for example compared with its surroundings an animal cell has a much higher concentration of potassium ions k and a much lower concentration of sodium ions na the plasma membrane helps maintain these steep gradients by pumping na out of the cell and k into the cell as in other types of cellular work atp supplies the energy for most active transport one way atp can power active transport is by transferring its terminal phosphate group directly to the transport protein this can induce the protein to change its shape in a manner that translocate a solute bound to the protein across the membrane one transport system that works this way is the sodiumpotassium pump which exchanges na for k across the plasma membrane of animal cells figure 715 the distinction between passive transport and active transport is reviewed in figure 716 how ion pumps maintain membrane potential all cells have voltages across their plasma membranes voltage is electrical potential energya separation of opposite charges the cytoplasmic side of the membrane is negative in charge relative to the extracellular side because of an unequal distribution of anions and cations on the two sides the voltage across a membrane called a membrane potential ranges from about 50 to 200 millivolts mv the minus sign indicates that the inside of the cell is negative relative to the outside the membrane potential acts like a battery an energy source that affects the traffic of all charged substances across the membrane because the inside of the cell is negative compared with the outside the membrane potential favors the passive transport of cations into the cell and anions out of the cell thus two forces drive the diffusion of ions across a membrane a chemical force the ions concentration gradient and an electrical force the effect of the membrane potential on the ions movement this combination of forces acting on an ion is called the electrochemical gradient in the case of ions then we must refine our concept of passive transport an ion diffuses not simply down its concentration gradient but more exactly down its electrochemical gradient for example the concentration of na inside a resting nerve cell is much lower than outside it when the cell is stimulated gated channels open that facilitate na diffusion sodium ions then fall down their electrochemical gradient driven by the concentration gradient of na and by the attraction of these cations to the negative side inside of the membrane in this example both electrical and chemical contributions to the electrochemical gradient act in the same direction across the membrane but this is not always so in cases where electrical forces due to the membrane potential oppose the simple diffusion of an ion down its concentration gradient active transport may be necessary in chapter 48 youll learn about the importance of electrochemical gradients and membrane potentials in the transmission of nerve impulses some membrane proteins that actively transport ions contribute to the membrane potential an example is the sodiumpotassium pump notice in figure 715 that the pump does not translocate na and k one for one but pumps three sodium ions out of the cell for every two potassium ions it pumps into the cell with each crank of the pump there is a net transfer of one positive charge from the cytoplasm to the extracellular fluid a process that stores energy as voltage a transport protein that generates voltage across a membrane is called an electrogenic pump the sodiumpotassium pump appears to be the major electrogenic pump of animal cells the main electrogenic pump of plants fungi and bacteria is a proton pump which actively transports protons hydrogen ions h out of the cell the pumping of h transfers positive charge from the cytoplasm to the extracellular solution figure 717 by generating voltage across membranes electrogenic pumps help store energy that can be tapped for cellular work one important use of proton gradients in the cell is for atp synthesis during cellular respiration as you will see in chapter 9 another is a type of membrane traffic called cotransport cotransport coupled transport by a membrane protein a solute that exists in different concentrations across a membrane can do work as it moves across that membrane by diffusion down its concentration gradient this is analogous to water that has been pumped uphill and performs work as it flows back down in a mechanism called cotransport a transport protein a cotransporter can couple the downhill diffusion of the solute to the uphill transport of a second substance against its own concentration gradient for instance a plant cell uses the gradient of h generated by its atppowered proton pumps to drive the active transport of amino acids sugars and several other nutrients into the cell in the example shown in figure 718 a cotransporter couples the return of h to the transport of sucrose into the cell this protein can translocate sucrose into the cell against its concentration gradient but only if the sucrose molecule travels in the company of an h the h uses the transport protein as an avenue to diffuse down its own electrochemical gradient which is maintained by the proton pump plants use sucrose cotransport to load sucrose produced by photosynthesis into cells in the veins of leaves the vascular tissue of the plant can then distribute the sugar to non photosynthetic organs such as roots what we know about cotransport proteins in animal cells has helped us find more effective treatments for diarrhea a serious problem in developing countries normally sodium in waste is reabsorbed in the colon maintaining constant levels in the body but diarrhea expels waste so rapidly that reabsorption is not possible and sodium levels fall precipitously to treat this lifethreatening condition patients are given a solution to drink containing high concentrations of salt nacl and glucose the solutes are taken up by sodiumglucose cotransporters on the surface of intestinal cells and passed through the cells into the blood this simple treatment has lowered infant mortality worldwide,active transport is a cellular process that moves solutes against their concentration gradients requiring energy input unlike facilitated diffusion which is passive and moves substances down their gradients active transport uses carrier proteins to transport molecules from areas of low concentration to areas of high concentration this process is essential for maintaining the proper internal environment of cells key points include energy requirement active transport requires energy often derived from atp atp transfers its terminal phosphate group to transport proteins causing them to change shape and move solutes across the membrane sodiumpotassium pump this pump actively transports sodium ions na out of the cell and potassium ions k into the cell creating steep gradients essential for cellular functions membrane potential cells maintain a membrane potential an electrical charge difference across their membranes which influences ion movement and aids in signal transmission in nerve cells cotransport this mechanism links the diffusion of one substance down its gradient to the transport of another substance against its gradient for example h ions help transport sucrose into plant cells active transport is crucial for cellular homeostasis and nutrient uptake
bulk transport across the plasma membrane occurs by exocytosis and endocytosis water and small solutes enter and leave the cell by diffusing through the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane or by being pumped or moved across the membrane by transport proteins however large moleculessuch as proteins and polysaccharides as well as larger particlesgenerally cross the membrane in bulk packaged in vesicles like active transport these processes require energy exocytosis as seen in chapter 6 the cell secretes certain molecules by the fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane this process is called exocytosis a transport vesicle that has budded from the golgi apparatus moves along microtubules of the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane when the vesicle membrane and plasma membrane come into contact specific proteins rearrange the lipid molecules of the two bilayers so that the two membranes fuse the contents of the vesicle spill out of the cell and the vesicle membrane becomes part of the plasma membrane see figure 79 step 4 many secretory cells use exocytosis to export products for example cells in the pancreas that make insulin secrete it into the extracellular fluid by exocytosis in another example nerve cells use exocytosis to release neurotransmitters that signal other neurons or muscle cells when plant cells are making cell walls exocytosis delivers proteins and carbohydrates from golgi vesicles to the outside of the cell endocytosis in endocytosis the cell takes in molecules and particulate matter by forming new vesicles from the plasma membrane although the proteins involved in the processes are different the events of endocytosis look like the reverse of exocytosis first a small area of the plasma membrane sinks inward to form a pocket then as the pocket deepens it pinches in forming a vesicle containing material that had been outside the cell study figure 719 carefully to understand the three types of endocytosis phagocytosis cellular eating pinocytosis cellular drinking and receptormediated endocytosis which is considered a form of pinocytosis human cells use receptormediated endocytosis to take in cholesterol for membrane synthesis and the synthesis of other steroids cholesterol travels in the blood in particles called lowdensity lipoproteins ldls each a complex of lipids and a protein ldls bind to ldl receptors on plasma membranes and then enter the cells by endocytosis ldls thus act as ligands a term for any molecule that binds specifically to a receptor site on another molecule in the inherited disease familial hypercholesterolemia characterized by a very high level of cholesterol in the blood ldls cannot enter cells because the ldl receptor proteins are defective or missing consequently cholesterol accumulates in the blood where it contributes to early atherosclerosis the buildup of lipid deposits within the walls of blood vessels this buildup narrows the space in the vessels and impedes blood flow and can result in heart damage and stroke vesicles not only transport substances to be released from the cell but also provide a mechanism for rejuvenating or remodeling the plasma membrane endocytosis and exocytosis occur continually in most eukaryotic cells yet the amount of plasma membrane in a nongrowing cell remains fairly constant the addition of membrane by one process appears to offset the loss of membrane by the other energy and cellular work have figured prominently in our study of membranes we have seen for example that active transport is powered by atp in the next three chapters you will learn more about how cells acquire chemical energy to do the work of life in phagocytosis a cell engulfs a particle by extending pseudopodia singular pseudopodium around it and packaging it within a membranous sac called a food vacuole the particle will be digested after the food vacuole fuses with a lysosome see figure 613a in pinocytosis a cell continually gulps droplets of extracellular fluid into tiny vesicles formed by infoldings of the plasma membrane in this way the cell obtains molecules dissolved in the droplets because any and all solutes are taken into the cell pinocytosis as shown here is nonspecific for the substances it transports in many cases as above the parts of the plasma membrane that form vesicles are lined on their cytoplasmic side by a fuzzy layer of coat protein the pits and resulting vesicles are said to be coated receptormediated endocytosis is a specialized type of pinocytosis that enables the cell to acquire bulk quantities of specific substances even though those substances may not be very concentrated in the extracellular fluid embedded in the plasma membrane are proteins with receptor sites exposed to the extracellular fluid specific solutes bind to the sites the receptor proteins then cluster in coated pits and each coated pit forms a vesicle containing the bound molecules notice that there are relatively more bound molecules purple triangles inside the vesicle but other molecules green balls are also present after the ingested material is liberated from the vesicle the emptied receptors are recycled to the plasma membrane by the same vesicle not shown,bulk transport is a crucial cellular process for moving large molecules such as proteins and polysaccharides across the plasma membrane this occurs through two primary mechanisms exocytosis and endocytosis both of which require energy exocytosis involves the fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane to release their contents outside the cell for instance pancreatic cells secrete insulin via exocytosis and nerve cells release neurotransmitters to signal other cells the vesicle membrane becomes part of the plasma membrane during this process endocytosis on the other hand allows cells to take in substances by forming new vesicles from the plasma membrane there are three main types of endocytosis phagocytosis cellular eating the cell engulfs large particles by extending pseudopodia forming a food vacuole that fuses with a lysosome for digestion pinocytosis cellular drinking the cell continuously takes in droplets of extracellular fluid in nonspecific vesicles receptormediated endocytosis this specialized form of pinocytosis enables cells to acquire specific substances like cholesterol by binding them to receptors in coated pits which then form vesicles together exocytosis and endocytosis help regulate membrane composition and facilitate communication and nutrient uptake in cells
the energy of life the living cell is a chemical factory in miniature where thousands of reactions occur within a microscopic space sugars can be converted to amino acids that are linked together into proteins when needed conversely when food is digested proteins are dismantled into amino acids that can be converted to sugars in multicellular organisms many cells export chemical products that are used in other parts of the organism the process called cellular respiration drives this cellular economy by extracting the energy stored in sugars and other fuels cells apply this energy to perform various types of work such as the transport of solutes across the plasma membrane which we discussed in chapter 7 in a more exotic example the ocean waves shown in figure 81 are brightly illuminated from within by freefloating singlecelled marine organisms called dinoflagellates these dinoflagellates convert the energy stored in certain organic molecules to light a process called bioluminescence most bioluminescent organisms are found in the oceans but some exist on land such as the bioluminescent fungus seen at the lower left bioluminescence and other metabolic activities carried out by a cell are precisely coordinated and controlled in its complexity its efficiency and its responsiveness to subtle changes the cell is peerless as a chemical factory the concepts of metabolism that you learn in this chapter will help you understand how matter and energy flow during lifes processes and how that flow is regulated an organisms metabolism transforms matter and energy subject to the laws of thermodynamics the totality of an organisms chemical reactions is called metabolism from the greek metabole change metabolism is an emergent property of life that arises from orderly interactions between molecules organization of the chemistry of life into metabolic pathways we can picture a cells metabolism as an elaborate road map of the thousands of chemical reactions that occur in a cell arranged as intersecting metabolic pathways a metabolic pathway begins with a specific molecule which is then altered in a series of defined steps resulting in a certain product each step of the pathway is catalyzed by a specific enzyme analogous to the red yellow and green stoplights that control the flow of automobile traffic mechanisms that regulate enzymes balance metabolic supply and demand metabolism as a whole manages the material and energy resources of the cell some metabolic pathways release energy by breaking down complex molecules to simpler compounds these degradative processes are called catabolic pathways or breakdown pathways a major pathway of catabolism is cellular respiration in which the sugar glucose and other organic fuels are broken down in the presence of oxygen to carbon dioxide and water pathways can have more than one starting molecule andor product energy that was stored in the organic molecules becomes available to do the work of the cell such as ciliary beating or membrane transport anabolic pathways in contrast consume energy to build complicated molecules from simpler ones they are sometimes called biosynthetic pathways examples of anabolism are the synthesis of an amino acid from simpler molecules and the synthesis of a protein from amino acids catabolic and anabolic pathways are the downhill and uphill avenues of the metabolic landscape energy released from the downhill reactions of catabolic pathways can be stored and then used to drive the uphill reactions of anabolic pathways in this chapter we will focus on mechanisms common to metabolic pathways because energy is fundamental to all metabolic processes a basic knowledge of energy is necessary to understand how the living cell works although we will use some nonliving examples to study energy the concepts demonstrated by these examples also apply to bioenergetics the study of how energy flows through living organisms,cells are dynamic chemical factories where a multitude of reactions occur simultaneously converting nutrients into energy and building blocks necessary for life metabolism encompasses all these chemical reactions classified into two main categories catabolic and anabolic pathways catabolic pathways break down complex molecules into simpler ones releasing energy in the process a primary example is cellular respiration where glucose and other organic fuels are oxidized to produce carbon dioxide and water releasing energy that powers cellular activities anabolic pathways in contrast consume energy to synthesize complex molecules from simpler ones for example amino acids are linked to form proteins requiring energy input metabolism is organized into metabolic pathways where each specific molecule undergoes a series of enzymatic transformations leading to the formation of end products enzymes regulate these pathways ensuring a balance between supply and demand energy flow through living organisms is guided by the laws of thermodynamics and understanding these metabolic processes is crucial for grasping how cells manage their material and energy resources this chapter will explore the fundamental mechanisms of metabolism and bioenergetics illustrating how energy transitions drive lifes processes
forms of energy energy is the capacity to cause change in everyday life energy is important because some forms of energy can be used to do workthat is to move matter against opposing forces such as gravity and friction put another way energy is the ability to rearrange a collection of matter for example you expend energy to turn the pages of this book and your cells expend energy in transporting certain substances across membranes energy exists in various forms and the work of life depends on the ability of cells to transform energy from one form to another energy can be associated with the relative motion of objects this energy is called kinetic energy moving objects can perform work by imparting motion to other matter a pool player uses the motion of the cue stick to push the cue ball which in turn moves the other balls water gushing through a dam turns turbines and the contraction of leg muscles pushes bicycle pedals thermal energy is kinetic energy associated with the random movement of atoms or molecules thermal energy in transfer from one object to another is called heat light is also a type of energy that can be harnessed to perform work such as powering photosynthesis in green plants an object not presently moving may still possess energy energy that is not kinetic is called potential energy it is energy that matter possesses because of its location or structure water behind a dam for instance possesses energy because of its altitude above sea level molecules possess energy because of the arrangement of electrons in the bonds between their atoms chemical energy is a term used by biologists to refer to the potential energy available for release in a chemical reaction recall that catabolic pathways release energy by breaking down complex molecules biologists say that these complex molecules such as glucose are high in chemical energy during a catabolic reaction some bonds are broken and others formed releasing energy and resulting in lowerenergy breakdown products this transformation also occurs in the engine of a car when the hydrocarbons of gasoline react explosively with oxygen releasing the energy that pushes the pistons and producing exhaust although less explosive a similar reaction of food molecules with oxygen provides chemical energy in biological systems producing carbon dioxide and water as waste products biochemical pathways carried out in the context of cellular structures enable cells to release chemical energy from food molecules and use the energy to power life processes how is energy converted from one form to another consider figure 82 the young woman climbing the ladder to the diving platform is releasing chemical energy from the food she ate for lunch and using some of that energy to perform the work of climbing the kinetic energy of muscle movement is thus being transformed into potential energy due to her increasing height above the water the young man diving is converting his potential energy to kinetic energy which is then transferred to the water as he enters it a small amount of energy is lost as heat due to friction now lets consider the original source of the organic food molecules that provided the necessary chemical energy for the diver to climb the steps this chemical energy was itself derived from light energy by plants during photosynthesis organisms are energy transformers,energy is the ability to cause change or do work such as moving objects or overcoming forces like gravity and friction it comes in various forms with kinetic energy associated with the movement of objects for example a player can use the motion of a cue stick to move a pool ball and muscles use kinetic energy to push bicycle pedals thermal energy is a type of kinetic energy that arises from the random movement of atoms and molecules and when transferred it is known as heat light is also a form of energy used by plants during photosynthesis to power their biological processes in contrast potential energy is the energy stored in an object due to its position or structure like water held behind a dam or energy stored in the bonds of molecules chemical energy refers to potential energy stored in molecules and released during chemical reactions for instance food molecules store chemical energy that is released through metabolic pathways allowing cells to perform vital tasks this chemical energy originally comes from sunlight captured by plants during photosynthesis energy transformation like converting chemical energy into kinetic energy is crucial for both biological and physical processes
the laws of energy transformation the study of the energy transformations that occur in a collection of matter is called thermodynamics scientists use the word system to denote the matter under study they refer to the rest of the universeeverything outside the systemas the surroundings an isolated system such as that approximated by liquid in a thermos bottle is unable to exchange either energy or matter with its surroundings outside the thermos in an open system energy and matter can be transferred between the system and its surroundings organisms are open systems they absorb energyfor instance light energy or chemical energy in the form of organic moleculesand release heat and metabolic waste products such as carbon dioxide to the surroundings two laws of thermodynamics govern energy transformations in organisms and all other collections of matter the first law of thermodynamics according to the first law of thermodynamics the energy of the universe is constant energy can be transferred and transformed but it cannot be created or destroyed the first law is also known as the principle of conservation of energy the electric company does not make energy but merely converts it to a form that is convenient for us to use by converting sunlight to chemical energy a plant acts as an energy transformer not an energy producer the brown bear in figure 83a will convert the chemical energy of the organic molecules in its food to kinetic and other forms of energy as it carries out biological processes what happens to this energy after it has performed work the second law of thermodynamics helps to answer this question the second law of thermodynamics if energy cannot be destroyed why cant organisms simply recycle their energy over and over again it turns out that during every energy transfer or transformation some energy becomes unavailable to do work in most energy transformations more usable forms of energy are at least partly converted to thermal energy and released as heat only a small fraction of the chemical energy from the food in figure 83a is transformed into the motion of the brown bear shown in figure 83b most is lost as heat which dissipates rapidly through the surroundings in the process of carrying out chemical reactions that perform various kinds of work living cells unavoidably convert other forms of energy to heat a system can put this energy to work only when there is a temperature difference that results in thermal energy flowing as heat from a warmer location to a cooler one if temperature is uniform as it is in a living cell then the heat generated during a chemical reaction will simply warm a body of matter such as the organism this can make a room crowded with people uncomfortably warm as each person is carrying out a multitude of chemical reactions a logical consequence of the loss of usable energy as heat to the surroundings is that each energy transfer or transformation makes the universe more disordered scientists use a quantity called entropy as a measure of disorder or randomness the more randomly arranged a collection of matter is the greater its entropy we can now state the second law of thermodynamics every energy transfer or transformation increases the entropy of the universe although order can increase locally there is an unstoppable trend toward randomization of the universe as a whole in many cases increased entropy is evident in the physical disintegration of a systems organized structure for example you can observe increasing entropy in the gradual decay of an unmaintained building much of the increasing entropy of the universe is less obvious however because it takes the form of increasing amounts of heat and less ordered forms of matter as the bear in figure 83b converts chemical energy to kinetic energy it is also increasing the disorder of its surroundings by producing heat and small molecules such as the co2 it exhales that are the breakdown products of food the concept of entropy helps us understand why certain processes are energetically favorable and occur on their own it turns out that if a given process by itself leads to an increase in entropy that process can proceed without requiring an input of energy such a process is called a spontaneous process note that as were using it here the word spontaneous does not imply that the process would occur quickly rather the word signifies that it is energetically favorable in fact it may be helpful for you to think of the phrase energetically favorable when you read the formal term spontaneous some spontaneous processes such as an explosion may be virtually instantaneous while others such as the rusting of an old car over time are much slower a process that considered on its own leads to a decrease in entropy is said to be nonspontaneous it will happen only if energy is supplied we know from experience that certain events occur spontaneously and others do not for instance we know that water flows downhill spontaneously but moves uphill only with an input of energy such as when a machine pumps the water against gravity some energy is inevitably lost as heat increasing entropy in the surroundings so usage of energy ensures that a nonspontaneous process also leads to an increase in the entropy of the universe as a whole biological order and disorder living systems increase the entropy of their surroundings as predicted by thermodynamic law it is true that cells create ordered structures from less organized starting materials for example simpler molecules are ordered into the more complex structure of an amino acid and amino acids are ordered into polypeptide chains at the organismal level as well complex and beautifully ordered structures result from biological processes that use simpler starting materials figure 84 however an organism also takes in organized forms of matter and energy from the surroundings and replaces them with less ordered forms for example an animal obtains starch proteins and other complex molecules from the food it eats as catabolic pathways break these molecules down the animal releases carbon dioxide and watersmall molecules that possess less chemical energy than the food did see figure 83b the depletion of chemical energy is accounted for by heat generated during metabolism on a larger scale energy flows into most ecosystems in the form of light and exits in the form of heat see figure 110 during the early history of life complex organisms evolved from simpler ancestors for instance we can trace the ancestry of the plant kingdom from much simpler organisms called green algae to more complex flowering plants however this increase in organization over time in no way violates the second law the entropy of a particular system such as an organism may actually decrease as long as the total entropy of the universethe system plus its surroundingsincreases thus organisms are islands of low entropy in an increasingly random universe the evolution of biological order is perfectly consistent with the laws of thermodynamics,thermodynamics is the study of energy transformations in systems and surroundings organisms as open systems exchange energy and matter with their environment the first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed only transformed known as the conservation of energy for example plants convert sunlight to chemical energy and organisms use chemical energy from food for biological processes the second law of thermodynamics explains that during energy transformations some energy is lost as heat increasing the disorder or entropy of the universe entropy is a measure of randomness and every energy transfer increases it spontaneous processes occur without energy input and lead to increased entropy while nonspontaneous processes require energy and still contribute to overall entropy living systems despite creating organized structures from simpler materials increase the entropy of their surroundings through processes like metabolism which release heat and simpler molecules like carbon dioxide the evolution of complex organisms from simpler ancestors aligns with these thermodynamic laws as biological order can increase locally while universal entropy continues to rise
the freeenergy change of a reaction tells us whether or not the reaction occurs spontaneously the laws of thermodynamics that weve just discussed apply to the universe as a whole as biologists we want to understand the chemical reactions of lifefor example which reactions occur spontaneously and which ones require some input of energy from outside but how can we know this without assessing the energy and entropy changes in the entire universe for each separate reaction freeenergy change g recall that the universe is really equivalent to the system plus the surroundings in 1878 j willard gibbs a professor at yale defined a very useful function called the gibbs free energy of a system without considering its surroundings symbolized by the letter g well refer to the gibbs free energy simply as free energy free energy is the portion of a systems energy that can perform work when temperature and pressure are uniform throughout the system as in a living cell lets consider how we determine the freeenergy change that occurs when a system changesfor example during a chemical reaction the change in free energy g can be calculated for a chemical reaction by applying the following equation g h ts this equation uses only properties of the system the reaction itself h symbolizes the change in the systems enthalpy in biological systems equivalent to total energy s is the change in the systems entropy and t is the absolute temperature in kelvin k units k c 273 see appendix c once we know the value of g for a process we can use it to predict whether the process will be spontaneous that is whether it is energetically favorable and will occur without an input of energy more than a century of experiments has shown that only processes with a negative g are spontaneous for g to be negative h must be negative the system gives up enthalpy and h decreases or ts must be positive the system gives up order and s increases or both when h and ts are tallied g has a negative value g 6 0 for all spontaneous processes in other words every spontaneous process decreases the systems free energy and processes that have a positive or zero g are never spontaneous this information is immensely interesting to biologists for it gives us the power to predict which kinds of change can happen without an input of energy such spontaneous changes can be harnessed to perform work this principle is very important in the study of metabolism where a major goal is to determine which reactions can supply energy for cellular work free energy stability and equilibrium as we saw in the previous section when a process occurs spontaneously in a system we can be sure that g is negative another way to think of g is to realize that it represents the difference between the free energy of the final state and the free energy of the initial state g gfinal state ginitial state thus g can be negative only when the process involves a loss of free energy during the change from initial state to final state because it has less free energy the system in its final state is less likely to change and is therefore more stable than it was previously we can think of free energy as a measure of a systems instabilityits tendency to change to a more stable state unstable systems higher g tend to change in such a way that they become more stable lower g for example a diver on top of a platform is less stable more likely to fall than when floating in the water a drop of concentrated dye is less stable more likely to disperse than when the dye is spread randomly through the liquid and a glucose molecule is less stable more likely to break down than the simpler molecules into which it can be split figure 85 unless something prevents it each of these systems will move toward greater stability the diver falls the solution becomes uniformly colored and the glucose molecule is broken down into smaller molecules another term that describes a state of maximum stability is equilibrium which you learned about in chapter 2 in connection with chemical reactions there is an important relationship between free energy and equilibrium including chemical equilibrium recall that most chemical reactions are reversible and proceed to a point at which the forward and backward reactions occur at the same rate the reaction is then said to be at chemical equilibrium and there is no further net change in the relative concentration of products and reactants as a reaction proceeds toward equilibrium the free energy of the mixture of reactants and products decreases free energy increases when a reaction is somehow pushed away from equilibrium perhaps by removing some of the products and thus changing their concentration relative to that of the reactants for a system at equilibrium g is at its lowest possible value in that system we can think of the equilibrium state as a freeenergy valley any change from the equilibrium position will have a positive g and will not be spontaneous for this reason systems never spontaneously move away from equilibrium because a system at equilibrium cannot spontaneously change it can do no work a process is spontaneous and can perform work only when it is moving toward equilibrium,the freeenergy change g of a reaction indicates whether a reaction will occur spontaneously in 1878 j willard gibbs introduced the concept of gibbs free energy a measure of the energy available in a system to perform work under constant temperature and pressure such as in living cells the equation g h ts helps calculate the free energy change where h represents the change in total energy enthalpy t is the temperature in kelvin and s is the change in entropy or disorder of the system a reaction is spontaneous if g is negative meaning the system either releases energy negative h or becomes more disordered positive s spontaneous reactions tend to make a system more stable in contrast systems at equilibrium have the lowest free energy and no further change or work can occur naturally understanding free energy is crucial for studying metabolic reactions as it helps identify which processes can supply energy for cellular work
free energy and metabolism we can now apply the freeenergy concept more specifically to the chemistry of lifes processes exergonic and endergonic reactions in metabolism based on their freeenergy changes chemical reactions can be classified as either exergonic energy outward or endergonic energy inward an exergonic reaction proceeds with a net release of free energy figure 86a because the chemical mixture loses free energy g decreases g is negative for an exergonic reaction using g as a standard for spontaneity exergonic reactions are those that occur spontaneously remember the word spontaneous implies that it is energetically favorable not that it will occur rapidly the magnitude of g for an exergonic reaction represents the maximum amount of work the reaction can perform the greater the decrease in free energy the greater the amount of work that can be done we can use the overall reaction for cellular respiration as an example c6h12o6 6 o2 s 6 co2 6 h2o g 686 kcalmol 2870 kjmol for each mole 180 g of glucose broken down by respiration under what are called standard conditions 1 m of each reactant and product 25c ph 7 686 kcal 2870 kj of energy are made available for work because energy must be conserved the chemical products of respiration store 686 kcal less free energy per mole than the reactants the products are in a sense the spent exhaust of a process that tapped the free energy stored in the bonds of the sugar molecules it is important to realize that the breaking of bonds does not release energy on the contrary as you will soon see it requires energy the phrase energy stored in bonds is shorthand for the potential energy that can be released when new bonds are formed after the original bonds break as long as the products are of lower free energy than the reactants an endergonic reaction is one that absorbs free energy from its surroundings figure 86b because this kind of reaction essentially stores free energy in molecules g increases g is positive such reactions are nonspontaneous and the magnitude of g is the quantity of energy required to drive the reaction if a chemical process is exergonic downhill releasing energy in one direction then the reverse process must be endergonic uphill using energy a reversible process cannot be downhill in both directions if g 686 kcalmol for respiration which converts glucose and oxygen to carbon dioxide and water then the reverse processthe conversion of carbon dioxide and water to glucose and oxygenmust be strongly endergonic with g 686 kcalmol such a reaction would never happen by itself how then do plants make the sugar that organisms use for energy plants get the required energy686 kcal to make a mole of glucosefrom the environment by capturing light and converting its energy to chemical energy next in a long series of exergonic steps they gradually spend that chemical energy to assemble glucose molecules equilibrium and metabolism reactions in an isolated system eventually reach equilibrium and can then do no work as illustrated by the isolated hydroelectric system in figure 87 the chemical reactions of metabolism are reversible and they too would reach equilibrium if they occurred in the isolation of a test tube because systems at equilibrium are at a minimum of g and can do no work a cell that has reached metabolic equilibrium is dead the fact that metabolism as a whole is never at equilibrium is one of the defining features of life like most systems a living cell is not in equilibrium the constant flow of materials in and out of the cell keeps the metabolic pathways from ever reaching equilibrium and the cell continues to do work throughout its life this principle is illustrated by the open and more realistic hydroelectric system in figure 88a however unlike this simple system in which water flowing downhill turns a single turbine a catabolic pathway in a cell releases free energy in a series of reactions an example is cellular respiration illustrated by analogy in figure 88b some of the reversible reactions of respiration are constantly pulled in one directionthat is they are kept out of equilibrium the key to maintaining this lack of equilibrium is that the product of a reaction does not accumulate but instead becomes a reactant in the next step finally waste products are expelled from the cell the overall sequence of reactions is kept going by the huge freeenergy difference between glucose and oxygen at the top of the energy hill and carbon dioxide and water at the downhill end as long as our cells have a steady supply of glucose or other fuels and oxygen and are able to expel waste products to the surroundings their metabolic pathways never reach equilibrium and can continue to do the work of life stepping back to look at the big picture we can see once again how important it is to think of organisms as open systems sunlight provides a daily source of free energy for an ecosystems plants and other photosynthetic organisms animals and other nonphotosynthetic organisms in an ecosystem must have a source of free energy in the form of the organic products of photosynthesis now that we have applied the freeenergy concept to metabolism we are ready to see how a cell actually performs the work of life a an open hydroelectric system water flowing through a turbine keeps driving the generator because intake and outflow of water keep the system from reaching equilibrium b a multistep open hydroelectric system cellular respiration is analogous to this system glucose is broken down in a series of exergonic reactions that power the work of the cell the product of each reaction is used as the reactant for the next so no reaction reaches equilibrium,in metabolism reactions can be classified as exergonic or endergonic based on freeenergy changes exergonic reactions release energy g 0 and occur spontaneously such as in cellular respiration where glucose is broken down to release energy the larger the negative g the more work the reaction can perform in contrast endergonic reactions absorb energy g 0 and are nonspontaneous requiring an energy input as in photosynthesis where plants convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose using sunlight cells avoid reaching metabolic equilibrium which would halt cellular work and lead to death they maintain a constant flow of materials ensuring that reactions stay out of equilibrium enabling continuous work in cellular respiration for instance products of one reaction are immediately used in the next preventing the system from stagnating overall the opensystem nature of living organisms constantly exchanging energy and materials with their environment keeps metabolic pathways active allowing life to persist
atp powers cellular work by coupling exergonic reactions to endergonic reactions a cell does three main kinds of work chemical work the pushing of endergonic reactions that would not occur spontaneously such as the synthesis of polymers from monomers chemical work will be discussed further here and in chapters 9 and 10 transport work the pumping of substances across membranes against the direction of spontaneous movement see chapter 7 mechanical work such as the beating of cilia see chapter 6 the contraction of muscle cells and the movement of chromosomes during cellular reproduction a key feature in the way cells manage their energy resources to do this work is energy coupling the use of an exergonic process to drive an endergonic one atp is responsible for mediating most energy coupling in cells and in most cases it acts as the immediate source of energy that powers cellular work the structure and hydrolysis of atp atp adenosine triphosphate was introduced when we discussed the phosphate group as a functional group see concept 43 atp contains the sugar ribose with the nitrogenous base adenine and a chain of three phosphate groups the triphosphate group bonded to it figure 89a in addition to its role in energy coupling atp is also one of the nucleoside triphosphates used to make rna see figure 524 the bonds between the phosphate groups of atp can be broken by hydrolysis when the terminal phosphate bond is broken by addition of a water molecule a molecule of inorganic phosphate hopo32 abbreviated p i throughout this book leaves the atp which becomes adenosine diphosphate or adp figure 89b the reaction is exergonic and releases 73 kcal of energy per mole of atp hydrolyzed atp h2o s adp p i g 73 kcalmol 305 kjmol this is the freeenergy change measured under standard conditions in the cell conditions do not conform to standard conditions primarily because reactant and product concentrations differ from 1 m for example when atp hydrolysis occurs under cellular conditions the actual g is about 13 kcalmol 78 greater than the energy released by atp hydrolysis under standard conditions because their hydrolysis releases energy the phosphate bonds of atp are sometimes referred to as highenergy phosphate bonds but the term is misleading the phosphate bonds of atp are not unusually strong bonds as highenergy may imply rather the reactants atp and water themselves have high energy relative to the energy of the products adp and p i the release of energy during the hydrolysis of atp comes from the chemical change of the system to a state of lower free energy not from the phosphate bonds themselves atp is useful to the cell because the energy it releases on losing a phosphate group is somewhat greater than the energy most other molecules could deliver but why does this hydrolysis release so much energy if we reexamine the atp molecule in figure 89a we can see that all three phosphate groups are negatively charged these like charges are crowded together and their mutual repulsion contributes to the instability of this region of the atp molecule the triphosphate tail of atp is the chemical equivalent of a compressed spring how the hydrolysis of atp performs work when atp is hydrolyzed in a test tube the release of free energy merely heats the surrounding water in an organism this same generation of heat can sometimes be beneficial for instance the process of shivering uses atp hydrolysis during muscle contraction to warm the body in most cases in the cell however the generation of heat alone would be an inefficient and potentially dangerous use of a valuable energy resource instead the cells proteins harness the energy released during atp hydrolysis in several ways to perform the three types of cellular workchemical transport and mechanical for example with the help of specific enzymes the cell is able to use the energy released by atp hydrolysis directly to drive chemical reactions that by themselves are endergonic if the g of an endergonic reaction is less than the amount of energy released by atp hydrolysis then the two reactions can be coupled so that overall the coupled reactions are exergonic this usually involves phosphorylation the transfer of a phosphate group from atp to some other molecule such as the reactant the recipient molecule with the phosphate group covalently bonded to it is then called a phosphorylated intermediate the key to coupling exergonic and endergonic reactions is the formation of this phosphorylated intermediate which is more reactive less stable than the original unphosphorylated molecule figure 810 transport and mechanical work in the cell are also nearly always powered by the hydrolysis of atp in these cases atp hydrolysis leads to a change in a proteins shape and often its ability to bind another molecule sometimes this occurs via a phosphorylated intermediate as seen for the transport protein in figure 811a in most instances of mechanical work involving motor proteins walking along cytoskeletal elements figure 811b a cycle occurs in which atp is first bound noncovalently to the motor protein next atp is hydrolyzed releasing adp and p i another atp molecule can then bind at each stage the motor protein changes its shape and ability to bind the cytoskeleton resulting in movement of the protein along the cytoskeletal track phosphorylation and dephosphorylation promote crucial protein shape changes during many other important cellular processes as well the regeneration of atp an organism at work uses atp continuously but atp is a renewable resource that can be regenerated by the addition of phosphate to adp figure 812 the free energy required to phosphorylate adp comes from exergonic breakdown reactions catabolism in the cell this shuttling of inorganic phosphate and energy is called the atp cycle and it couples the cells energyyielding exergonic processes to the energyconsuming endergonic ones the atp cycle proceeds at an astonishing pace for example a working muscle cell recycles its entire pool of atp in less than a minute that turnover represents 10 million molecules of atp consumed and regenerated per second per cell if atp could not be regenerated by the phosphorylation of adp humans would use up nearly their body weight in atp each day because both directions of a reversible process cannot be downhill the regeneration of atp is necessarily endergonic adp p i s atp h2o g 73 kcalmol 305 kjmol standard conditions since atp formation from adp and p i is not spontaneous free energy must be spent to make it occur catabolic exergonic pathways especially cellular respiration provide the energy for the endergonic process of making atp plants also use light energy to produce atp thus the atp cycle is a revolving door through which energy passes during its transfer from catabolic to anabolic pathways a glutamic acid conversion to glutamine glutamine synthesis from glutamic acid glu by itself is endergonic g is positive so it is not spontaneous b conversion reaction coupled with atp hydrolysis in the cell glutamine synthesis occurs in two steps coupled by a phosphorylated intermediate atp phosphorylates glutamic acid making it less stable ammonia displaces the phosphate group forming glutamine c freeenergy change for coupled reaction g for the glutamic acid conversion to glutamine 34 kcalmol plus g for atp hydrolysis 73 kcalmol gives the freeenergy change for the overall reaction 39 kcalmol because the overall process is exergonic net g is negative it occurs spontaneously,atp adenosine triphosphate is the primary energy carrier in cells driving essential processes by coupling energyreleasing exergonic reactions with energyrequiring endergonic reactions cells perform three main types of work using atp chemical work such as synthesizing polymers from monomers transport work which involves moving substances across cell membranes and mechanical work like muscle contraction or chromosome movement during cell division atp is composed of a ribose sugar adenine and three phosphate groups energy is released when atp undergoes hydrolysis breaking the terminal phosphate bond yielding adp adenosine diphosphate and inorganic phosphate this reaction releases approximately 73 kcalmol under standard conditions though its higher within the cell the released energy is used to drive reactions through phosphorylation where a phosphate group is transferred to another molecule increasing its reactivity atp is continuously regenerated by adding phosphate back to adp a process fueled by cellular respiration in animals or photosynthesis in plants this atp cycle enables constant recycling of atp ensuring a steady energy supply for cellular activities
enzymes speed up metabolic reactions by lowering energy barriers the laws of thermodynamics tell us what will and will not happen under given conditions but say nothing about the rate of these processes a spontaneous chemical reaction occurs without any requirement for outside energy but it may occur so slowly that it is imperceptible for example even though the hydrolysis of sucrose table sugar to glucose and fructose is exergonic occurring spontaneously with a release of free energy g 7 kcalmol a solution of sucrose dissolved in sterile water will sit for years at room temperature with no appreciable hydrolysis however if we add a small amount of the enzyme sucrase to the solution then all the sucrose may be hydrolyzed within seconds as shown below how does the enzyme do this an enzyme is a macromolecule that acts as a catalyst a chemical agent that speeds up a reaction without being consumed by the reaction in this chapter we are focusing on enzymes that are proteins some rna molecules called ribozymes can function as enzymes these will be discussed in chapters 17 and 25 without regulation by enzymes chemical traffic through the pathways of metabolism would become terribly congested because many chemical reactions would take such a long time in the next two sections we will see why spontaneous reactions can be slow and how an enzyme changes the situation the activation energy barrier every chemical reaction between molecules involves both bond breaking and bond forming for example the hydrolysis of sucrose involves breaking the bond between glucose and fructose and one of the bonds of a water molecule and then forming two new bonds as shown above changing one molecule into another generally involves contorting the starting molecule into a highly unstable state before the reaction can proceed this contortion can be compared to the bending of a metal key ring when you pry it open to add a new key the key ring is highly unstable in its opened form but returns to a stable state once the key is threaded all the way onto the ring to reach the contorted state where bonds can change reactant molecules must absorb energy from their surroundings when the new bonds of the product molecules form energy is released as heat and the molecules return to stable shapes with lower energy than the contorted state the initial investment of energy for starting a reaction the energy required to contort the reactant molecules so the bonds can breakis known as the free energy of activation or activation energy abbreviated ea in this book we can think of activation energy as the amount of energy needed to push the reactants to the top of an energy barrier or uphill so that the downhill part of the reaction can begin activation energy is often supplied by heat in the form of thermal energy that the reactant molecules absorb from the surroundings the absorption of thermal energy accelerates the reactant molecules so they collide more often and more forcefully it also agitates the atoms within the molecules making the breakage of bonds more likely when the molecules have absorbed enough energy for the bonds to break the reactants are in an unstable condition known as the transition state figure 813 graphs the energy changes for a hypothetical exergonic reaction that swaps portions of two reactant molecules ab cd s ac bd reactants products the activation of the reactants is represented by the uphill portion of the graph in which the freeenergy content of the reactant molecules is increasing at the summit when energy equivalent to ea has been absorbed the reactants are in the transition state they are activated and their bonds can be broken as the atoms then settle into their new more stable bonding arrangements energy is released to the surroundings this corresponds to the downhill part of the curve which shows the loss of free energy by the molecules the overall decrease in free energy means that ea is repaid with dividends as the formation of new bonds releases more energy than was invested in the breaking of old bonds the reaction shown in figure 813 is exergonic and occurs spontaneously g 6 0 however the activation energy provides a barrier that determines the rate of the reaction the reactants must absorb enough energy to reach the top of the activation energy barrier before the reaction can occur for some reactions ea is modest enough that even at room temperature there is sufficient thermal energy for many of the reactant molecules to reach the transition state in a short time in most cases however ea is so high and the transition state is reached so rarely that the reaction will hardly proceed at all in these cases the reaction will occur at a noticeable rate only if energy is provided usually by heat for example the reaction of gasoline and oxygen is exergonic and will occur spontaneously but energy is required for the molecules to reach the transition state and react only when the spark plugs fire in an automobile engine can there be the explosive release of energy that pushes the pistons without a spark a mixture of gasoline hydrocarbons and oxygen will not react because the ea barrier is too high how enzymes speed up reactions proteins dna and other complex cellular molecules are rich in free energy and have the potential to decompose spontaneously that is the laws of thermodynamics favor their breakdown these molecules persist only because at temperatures typical for cells few molecules can make it over the hump of activation energy the barriers for selected reactions must occasionally be surmounted however for cells to carry out the processes needed for life heat can increase the rate of a reaction by allowing reactants to attain the transition state more often but this would not work well in biological systems first high temperature denatures proteins and kills cells second heat would speed up all reactions not just those that are needed instead of heat organisms use catalysis to speed up reactions an enzyme catalyzes a reaction by lowering the ea barrier figure 814 enabling the reactant molecules to absorb enough energy to reach the transition state even at moderate temperatures as well discuss shortly an enzyme cannot change the g for a reaction it cannot make an endergonic reaction exergonic enzymes can only hasten reactions that would eventually occur anyway but this enables the cell to have a dynamic metabolism routing chemicals smoothly through metabolic pathways also enzymes are very specific for the reactions they catalyze so they determine which chemical processes will be going on in the cell at any given time,enzymes are specialized proteins that act as catalysts speeding up metabolic reactions by lowering the activation energy ea barrier required for chemical reactions to occur while spontaneous reactions can happen without external energy they often proceed too slowly to be noticeable for instance the hydrolysis of sucrose into glucose and fructose is an exergonic reaction releasing energy but it can take years without the enzyme sucrase key concepts activation energy ea the energy required to initiate a reaction by contorting reactant molecules into an unstable transition state transition state a temporary unstable condition that occurs when reactants have absorbed sufficient energy for bonds to break allowing the reaction to proceed enzymes work by reducing the activation energy enabling reactants to reach the transition state more easily even at moderate temperatures this process avoids the need for high heat which can denature proteins and harm cells importantly enzymes are highly specific determining which reactions occur in a cell and ensuring efficient metabolic pathways by facilitating these biochemical reactions enzymes are vital for maintaining cellular function and supporting life
substrate specificity of enzymes the reactant an enzyme acts on is referred to as the enzymes substrate the enzyme binds to its substrate or substrates when there are two or more reactants forming an enzymesubstrate complex while enzyme and substrate are joined the catalytic action of the enzyme converts the substrate to the product or products of the reaction the overall process can be summarized as follows for example the enzyme sucrase most enzyme names end in ase catalyzes the hydrolysis of the disaccharide sucrose into its two monosaccharides glucose and fructose see p 151 enzyme can recognize its specific substrate even among closely related compounds for instance sucrase will act only on sucrose and will not bind to other disaccharides such as maltose what accounts for this molecular recognition recall that most enzymes are proteins and proteins are macromolecules with unique threedimensional configurations the specificity of an enzyme results from its shape which is a consequence of its amino acid sequence only a restricted region of the enzyme molecule actually binds to the substrate this region called the active site is typically a pocket or groove on the surface of the enzyme where catalysis occurs figure 815a usually the active site is formed by only a few of the enzymes amino acids with the rest of the protein molecule providing a framework that determines the shape of the active site the specificity of an enzyme is attributed to a complementary fit between the shape of its active site and the shape of the substrate an enzyme is not a stiff structure locked into a given shape in fact recent work by biochemists has shown clearly that enzymes and other proteins as well seem to dance between subtly different shapes in a dynamic equilibrium with slight differences in free energy for each pose the shape that best fits the substrate isnt necessarily the one with the lowest energy but during the very short time the enzyme takes on this shape its active site can bind to the substrate it has been known for more than 50 years that the active site itself is also not a rigid receptacle for the substrate as the substrate enters the active site the enzyme changes shape slightly due to interactions between the substrates chemical groups and chemical groups on the side chains of the amino acids that form the active site this shape change makes the active site fit even more snugly around the substrate figure 815b the process is like a clasping handshake with binding between enzyme and substrate becoming tighter after the initial contact this socalled induced fit brings chemical groups of the active site into positions that enhance their ability to catalyze the chemical reaction catalysis in the enzymes active site in most enzymatic reactions the substrate is held in the active site by socalled weak interactions such as hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds r groups of a few of the amino acids that make up the active site catalyze the conversion of substrate to product and the product departs from the active site the enzyme is then free to take another substrate molecule into its active site the entire cycle happens so fast that a single enzyme molecule typically acts on about a thousand substrate molecules per second and some enzymes are even faster enzymes like other catalysts emerge from the reaction in their original form therefore very small amounts of enzyme can have a huge metabolic impact by functioning over and over again in catalytic cycles figure 816 shows a catalytic cycle involving two substrates and two products most metabolic reactions are reversible and an enzyme can catalyze either the forward or the reverse reaction depending on which direction has a negative g this in turn depends mainly on the relative concentrations of reactants and products the net effect is always in the direction of equilibrium enzymes use a variety of mechanisms that lower activation energy and speed up a reaction see figure 816 step 3 when there are two or more reactants the active site provides a template on which the substrates can come together in the proper orientation for a reaction to occur between them as the active site of an enzyme clutches the bound substrates the enzyme may stretch the substrate molecules toward their transitionstate form stressing and bending critical chemical bonds that must be broken during the reaction because ea is proportional to the difficulty of breaking the bonds distorting the substrate helps it approach the transition state and thus reduces the amount of free energy that must be absorbed to achieve that state the active site may also provide a microenvironment that is more conducive to a particular type of reaction than the solution itself would be without the enzyme for example if the active site has amino acids with acidic r groups the active site may be a pocket of low ph in an otherwise neutral cell in such cases an acidic amino acid may facilitate h transfer to the substrate as a key step in catalyzing the reaction amino acids in the active site directly participate in the chemical reaction sometimes this process even involves brief covalent bonding between the substrate and the side chain of an amino acid of the enzyme subsequent steps of the reaction restore the side chains to their original states so that the active site is the same after the reaction as it was before the rate at which a particular amount of enzyme converts substrate to product is partly a function of the initial concentration of the substrate the more substrate molecules that are available the more frequently they access the active sites of the enzyme molecules however there is a limit to how fast the reaction can be pushed by adding more substrate to a fixed concentration of enzyme at some point the concentration of substrate will be high enough that all enzyme molecules have their active sites engaged as soon as the product exits an active site another substrate molecule enters at this substrate concentration the enzyme is said to be saturated and the rate of the reaction is determined by the speed at which the active site converts substrate to product when an enzyme population is saturated the only way to increase the rate of product formation is to add more enzyme cells often increase the rate of a reaction by producing more enzyme molecules you can graph the overall progress of an enzymatic reaction in the scientific skills exercise,enzymes are specialized proteins that act as biological catalysts facilitating chemical reactions by binding to specific reactants known as substrates this binding forms an enzymesubstrate complex allowing the enzyme to convert substrates into products each enzyme has a unique active site a specific region that recognizes and fits the shape of its substrate for example the enzyme sucrase catalyzes the hydrolysis of sucrose into glucose and fructose demonstrating its substrate specificity the catalytic action of enzymes involves several mechanisms template function the active site aligns substrates in the optimal orientation for reaction strain induction enzymes can distort the substrates shape to lower the activation energy ea needed for the reaction microenvironment creation the active site may create a favorable environment such as an acidic pocket to enhance the reaction direct participation amino acids in the active site can engage in the reaction occasionally forming temporary covalent bonds with the substrate the rate of enzymatic reactions is influenced by substrate concentration increasing until all active sites are occupied saturation to boost reaction rates cells may produce more enzymes highlighting the significant metabolic impact of enzymes
effects of local conditions on enzyme activity the activity of an enzymehow efficiently the enzyme functionsis affected by general environmental factors such as temperature and ph it can also be affected by chemicals that specifically influence that enzyme in fact researchers have learned much about enzyme function by employing such chemicals effects of temperature and ph recall from chapter 5 that the threedimensional structures of proteins are sensitive to their environment as a consequence each enzyme works better under some conditions than under other conditions because these optimal conditions favor the most active shape for the enzyme temperature and ph are environmental factors important in the activity of an enzyme up to a point the rate of an enzymatic reaction increases with increasing temperature partly because substrates collide with active sites more frequently when the molecules move rapidly above that temperature however the speed of the enzymatic reaction drops sharply the thermal agitation of the enzyme molecule disrupts the hydrogen bonds ionic bonds and other weak interactions that stabilize the active shape of the enzyme and the protein molecule eventually denatures each enzyme has an optimal temperature at which its reaction rate is greatest without denaturing the enzyme this temperature allows the greatest number of molecular collisions and the fastest conversion of the reactants to product molecules most human enzymes have optimal temperatures of about 3540c close to human body temperature the thermophilic bacteria that live in hot springs contain enzymes with optimal temperatures of 70c or higher figure 817a just as each enzyme has an optimal temperature it also has a ph at which it is most active the optimal ph values for most enzymes fall in the range of ph 68 but there are exceptions for example pepsin a digestive enzyme in the human stomach works best at ph 2 such an acidic environment denatures most enzymes but pepsin is adapted to maintain its functional threedimensional structure in the acidic environment of the stomach in contrast trypsin a digestive enzyme residing in the alkaline environment of the human intestine has an optimal ph of 8 and would be denatured in the stomach figure 817b cofactors many enzymes require nonprotein helpers for catalytic activity these adjuncts called cofactors may be bound tightly to the enzyme as permanent residents or they may bind loosely and reversibly along with the substrate the cofactors of some enzymes are inorganic such as the metal atoms zinc iron and copper in ionic form if the cofactor is an organic molecule it is referred to more specifically as a coenzyme most vitamins are important in nutrition because they act as coenzymes or raw materials from which coenzymes are made enzyme inhibitors certain chemicals selectively inhibit the action of specific enzymes sometimes the inhibitor attaches to the enzyme by covalent bonds in which case the inhibition is usually irreversible many enzyme inhibitors however bind to the enzyme by weak interactions and when this occurs the inhibition is reversible some reversible inhibitors resemble the normal substrate molecule and compete for admission into the active site figure 818a and b these mimics called competitive inhibitors reduce the productivity of enzymes by blocking substrates from entering active sites this kind of inhibition can be overcome by increasing the concentration of substrate so that as active sites become available more substrate molecules than inhibitor molecules are around to gain entry to the sites in contrast noncompetitive inhibitors do not directly compete with the substrate to bind to the enzyme at the active site figure 818c instead they impede enzymatic reactions by binding to another part of the enzyme this interaction causes the enzyme molecule to change its shape in such a way that the active site becomes less effective at catalyzing the conversion of substrate to product toxins and poisons are often irreversible enzyme inhibitors an example is sarin a nerve gas sarin was released by terrorists in the tokyo subway in 1995 causing the death of several people and injury to many others this small molecule binds covalently to the r group on the amino acid serine which is found in the active site of acetylcholinesterase an enzyme important in the nervous system other examples include the pesticides ddt and parathion inhibitors of key enzymes in the nervous system finally many antibiotics are inhibitors of specific enzymes in bacteria for instance penicillin blocks the active site of an enzyme that many bacteria use to make their cell walls the evolution of enzymes thus far biochemists have discovered and named more than 4000 different enzymes in various species most likely a very small fraction of all enzymes how did this grand profusion of enzymes arise recall that most enzymes are proteins and proteins are encoded by genes a permanent change in a gene known as a mutation can result in a protein with one or more changed amino acids in the case of an enzyme if the changed amino acids are in the active site or some other crucial region the altered enzyme might have a novel activity or might bind to a different substrate under environmental conditions where the new function benefits the organism natural selection would tend to favor the mutated form of the gene causing it to persist in the population this simplified model is generally accepted as the main way in which the multitude of different enzymes arose over the past few billion years of lifes history data supporting this model have been collected by researchers using a lab procedure that mimics evolution in natural populations one group tested whether the function of an enzyme called galactosidase could change over time in populations of the bacterium escherichia coli e coli galactosidase breaks down the disaccharide lactose into the simple sugars glucose and galactose using molecular techniques the researchers introduced random mutations into e coli genes and then tested the bacteria for their ability to break down a slightly different disaccharide one that has the sugar fucose in place of galactose at the end of the experiment the evolved enzyme bound the new substrate several hundred times more strongly and broke it down 10 to 20 times more quickly than did the original enzyme the researchers found that six amino acids had changed in the enzyme altered in this experiment two of these changed amino acids were in the active site two were nearby and two were on the surface of the protein figure 819 this experiment and others like it strengthen the notion that a few changes can indeed alter enzyme function,enzymes are biological catalysts whose activity is influenced by local environmental factors particularly temperature and ph each enzyme has an optimal temperature generally around 3540c for human enzymes where the reaction rate is highest due to increased molecular collisions however extreme temperatures can lead to denaturation disrupting the enzymes active shape similarly enzymes have specific ph ranges for optimal performance for instance pepsin operates effectively at ph 2 in the acidic stomach while trypsin is active at ph 8 in the alkaline intestine in addition to temperature and ph enzymes often require cofactors which can be inorganic metals or organic molecules for catalytic activity enzyme inhibitors can disrupt this activity with competitive inhibitors blocking the active site and noncompetitive inhibitors altering the enzymes shape elsewhere the evolution of enzymes is driven by genetic mutations that change amino acids potentially enhancing enzyme functions or substrate binding research such as studies on e coli enzymes has shown that minor amino acid changes can significantly boost enzyme activity illustrating how natural selection shapes enzyme diversity over time
regulation of enzyme activity helps control metabolism chemical chaos would result if all of a cells metabolic pathways were operating simultaneously intrinsic to lifes processes is a cells ability to tightly regulate its metabolic pathways by controlling when and where its various enzymes are active it does this either by switching on and off the genes that encode specific enzymes as we will discuss in unit three or as we discuss here by regulating the activity of enzymes once they are made allosteric regulation of enzymes in many cases the molecules that naturally regulate enzyme activity in a cell behave something like reversible noncompetitive inhibitors see figure 818c these regulatory molecules change an enzymes shape and the functioning of its active site by binding to a site elsewhere on the molecule via noncovalent interactions allosteric regulation is the term used to describe any case in which a proteins function at one site is affected by the binding of a regulatory molecule to a separate site it may result in either inhibition or stimulation of an enzymes activity allosteric activation and inhibition most enzymes known to be allosterically regulated are constructed from two or more subunits each composed of a polypeptide chain with its own active site the entire complex oscillates between two different shapes one catalytically active and the other inactive figure 820a in the simplest kind of allosteric regulation an activating or inhibiting regulatory molecule binds to a regulatory site sometimes called an allosteric site often located where subunits join the binding of an activator to a regulatory site stabilizes the shape that has functional active sites whereas the binding of an inhibitor stabilizes the inactive form of the enzyme the subunits of an allosteric enzyme fit together in such a way that a shape change in one subunit is transmitted to all others through this interaction of subunits a single activator or inhibitor molecule that binds to one regulatory site will affect the active sites of all subunits fluctuating concentrations of regulators can cause a sophisticated pattern of response in the activity of cellular enzymes the products of atp hydrolysis adp and p i for example play a complex role in balancing the flow of traffic between anabolic and catabolic pathways by their effects on key enzymes atp binds to several catabolic enzymes allosterically lowering their affinity for substrate and thus inhibiting their activity adp however functions as an activator of the same enzymes this is logical because catabolism functions in regenerating atp if atp production lags behind its use adp accumulates and activates the enzymes that speed up catabolism producing more atp if the supply of atp exceeds demand then catabolism slows down as atp molecules accumulate and bind to the same enzymes inhibiting them youll see specific examples of this type of regulation when you learn about cellular respiration in the next chapter atp adp and other related molecules also affect key enzymes in anabolic pathways in this way allosteric enzymes control the rates of important reactions in both sorts of metabolic pathways in another kind of allosteric activation a substrate molecule binding to one active site in a multisubunit enzyme triggers a shape change in all the subunits thereby increasing catalytic activity at the other active sites figure 820b called cooperativity this mechanism amplifies the response of enzymes to substrates one substrate molecule primes an enzyme to act on additional substrate molecules more readily cooperativity is considered allosteric regulation because binding of the substrate to one active site affects catalysis in another active site although hemoglobin is not an enzyme it carries o2 classic studies on hemoglobin have elucidated the principle of cooperativity hemoglobin is made up of four subunits each with an oxygenbinding site see figure 518 the binding of an oxygen molecule to one binding site increases the affinity for oxygen of the remaining binding sites thus where oxygen is at high levels such as in the lungs or gills hemoglobins affinity for oxygen increases as more binding sites are filled in oxygendeprived tissues however the release of each oxygen molecule decreases the oxygen affinity of the other binding sites resulting in the release of oxygen where it is most needed cooperativity works similarly in multisubunit enzymes that have been studied feedback inhibition when atp allosterically inhibits an enzyme in an atpgenerating pathway the result is feedback inhibition a common mode of metabolic control in feedback inhibition a metabolic pathway is halted by the inhibitory binding of its end product to an enzyme that acts early in the pathway figure 821 shows an example of feedback inhibition operating on an anabolic pathway some cells use this fivestep pathway to synthesize the amino acid isoleucine from threonine another amino acid as isoleucine accumulates it slows down its own synthesis by allosterically inhibiting the enzyme for the first step of the pathway feedback inhibition thereby prevents the cell from making more isoleucine than is necessary and thus wasting chemical resources localization of enzymes within the cell the cell is not just a bag of chemicals with thousands of different kinds of enzymes and substrates in a random mix the cell is compartmentalized and cellular structures help bring order to metabolic pathways in some cases a team of enzymes for several steps of a metabolic pathway are assembled into a multienzyme complex the arrangement facilitates the sequence of reactions with the product from the first enzyme becoming the substrate for an adjacent enzyme in the complex and so on until the end product is released some enzymes and enzyme complexes have fixed locations within the cell and act as structural components of particular membranes others are in solution within particular membraneenclosed eukaryotic organelles each with its own internal chemical environment for example in eukaryotic cells the enzymes for cellular respiration reside in specific locations within mitochondria figure 822 in this chapter you have learned that metabolism the intersecting set of chemical pathways characteristic of life is a choreographed interplay of thousands of different kinds of cellular molecules in the next chapter we will explore cellular respiration the major catabolic pathway that breaks down organic molecules releasing energy that can be used for the crucial processes of life,cells tightly regulate metabolic pathways to avoid chaotic chemical reactions this regulation occurs either through gene expression or by controlling enzyme activity allosteric regulation involves molecules binding to an enzyme at a site separate from the active site leading to changes in the enzymes shape this can either activate or inhibit enzyme function enzymes often exist as multisubunit complexes allowing for coordinated responses an activator stabilizes the active shape while an inhibitor stabilizes the inactive form fluctuating concentrations of regulators such as atp and adp help balance anabolic and catabolic processes for instance atp can inhibit catabolic enzymes while adp activates them ensuring efficient atp production according to cellular needs additionally cooperativity enhances enzyme response to substrates binding of one substrate molecule can increase the enzymes affinity for others as seen in hemoglobins oxygen binding feedback inhibition prevents overproduction by allowing the end product of a metabolic pathway to inhibit an enzyme at the pathways start moreover cellular compartmentalization organizes enzyme activity facilitating efficient metabolic reactions within specific organelles like mitochondria for cellular respiration
catabolic pathways yield energy by oxidizing organic fuels metabolic pathways that release stored energy by breaking down complex molecules are called catabolic pathways see chapter 8 electron transfer plays a major role in these pathways in this section we consider these processes which are central to cellular respiration catabolic pathways and production of atp organic compounds possess potential energy as a result of the arrangement of electrons in the bonds between their atoms compounds that can participate in exergonic reactions can act as fuels through the activity of enzymes a cell systematically degrades complex organic molecules that are rich in potential energy to simpler waste products that have less energy some of the energy taken out of chemical storage can be used to do work the rest is dissipated as heat one catabolic process fermentation is a partial degradation of sugars or other organic fuel that occurs without the use of oxygen however the most efficient catabolic pathway is aerobic respiration in which oxygen is consumed as a reactant along with the organic fuel aerobic is from the greek aer air and bios life the cells of most eukaryotic and many prokaryotic organisms can carry out aerobic respiration some prokaryotes use substances other than oxygen as reactants in a similar process that harvests chemical energy without oxygen this process is called anaerobic respiration the prefix an means without technically the term cellular respiration includes both aerobic and anaerobic processes however it originated as a synonym for aerobic respiration because of the relationship of that process to organismal respiration in which an animal breathes in oxygen thus cellular respiration is often used to refer to the aerobic process a practice we follow in most of this chapter although very different in mechanism aerobic respiration is in principle similar to the combustion of gasoline in an automobile engine after oxygen is mixed with the fuel hydrocarbons food provides the fuel for respiration and the exhaust is carbon dioxide and water the overall process can be summarized as follows organic carbon compounds oxygen s dioxide water energy carbohydrates fats and protein molecules from food can all be processed and consumed as fuel as we will discuss later in the chapter in animal diets a major source of carbohydrates is starch a storage polysaccharide that can be broken down into glucose c6h12o6 subunits here we will learn the steps of cellular respiration by tracking the degradation of the sugar glucose c6h12o6 6 o2 s 6 co2 6 h2o energy atp heat this breakdown of glucose is exergonic having a freeenergy change of 686 kcal 2870 kj per mole of glucose decomposed g 686 kcalmol recall that a negative g indicates that the products of the chemical process store less energy than the reactants and that the reaction can happen spontaneouslyin other words without an input of energy catabolic pathways do not directly move flagella pump solutes across membranes polymerize monomers or perform other cellular work catabolism is linked to work by a chemical drive shaftatp see chapter 8 to keep working the cell must regenerate its supply of atp from adp and p i see figure 812 to understand how cellular respiration accomplishes this lets examine the fundamental chemical processes known as oxidation and reduction redox reactions oxidation and reduction how do the catabolic pathways that decompose glucose and other organic fuels yield energy the answer is based on the transfer of electrons during the chemical reactions the relocation of electrons releases energy stored in organic molecules and this energy ultimately is used to synthesize atp the principle of redox in many chemical reactions there is a transfer of one or more electrons e from one reactant to another these electron transfers are called oxidationreduction reactions or redox reactions for short in a redox reaction the loss of electrons from one substance is called oxidation and the addition of electrons to another substance is known as reduction note that adding electrons is called reduction adding negatively charged electrons to an atom reduces the amount of positive charge of that atom to take a simple nonbiological example consider the reaction between the elements sodium na and chlorine cl that forms table salt in the generalized reaction substance xe the electron donor is called the reducing agent it reduces y which accepts the donated electron substance y the electron acceptor is the oxidizing agent it oxidizes xe by removing its electron because an electron transfer requires both an electron donor and an acceptor oxidation and reduction always go hand in hand not all redox reactions involve the complete transfer of electrons from one substance to another some change the degree of electron sharing in covalent bonds methane combustion shown in figure 93 is an example the covalent electrons in methane are shared nearly equally between the bonded atoms because carbon and hydrogen have about the same affinity for valence electrons they are about equally electronegative see chapter 2 but when methane reacts with oxygen forming carbon dioxide electrons end up shared less equally between the carbon atom and its new covalent partners the oxygen atoms which are very electronegative in effect the carbon atom has partially lost its shared electrons thus methane has been oxidized now lets examine the fate of the reactant o2 the two atoms of the oxygen molecule o2 share their electrons equally but when oxygen reacts with the hydrogen from methane forming water the electrons of the covalent bonds spend more time near the oxygen see figure 93 in effect each oxygen atom has partially gained electrons so the oxygen molecule has been reduced because oxygen is so electronegative it is one of the most potent of all oxidizing agents energy must be added to pull an electron away from an atom just as energy is required to push a ball uphill the more electronegative the atom the stronger its pull on electrons the more energy is required to take an electron away from it an electron loses potential energy when it shifts from a less electronegative atom toward a more electronegative one just as a ball loses potential energy when it rolls downhill a redox reaction that moves electrons closer to oxygen such as the burning oxidation of methane therefore releases chemical energy that can be put to work oxidation of organic fuel molecules during cellular respiration the oxidation of methane by oxygen is the main combustion reaction that occurs at the burner of a gas stove the combustion of gasoline in an automobile engine is also a redox reaction the energy released pushes the pistons but the energyyielding redox process of greatest interest to biologists is respiration the oxidation of glucose and other molecules in food examine again the summary equation for cellular respiration but this time think of it as a redox process as in the combustion of methane or gasoline the fuel glucose is oxidized and oxygen is reduced the electrons lose potential energy along the way and energy is released in general organic molecules that have an abundance of hydrogen are excellent fuels because their bonds are a source of hilltop electrons whose energy may be released as these electrons fall down an energy gradient when they are transferred to oxygen the summary equation for respiration indicates that hydrogen is transferred from glucose to oxygen but the important point not visible in the summary equation is that the energy state of the electron changes as hydrogen with its electron is transferred to oxygen in respiration the oxidation of glucose transfers electrons to a lower energy state liberating energy that becomes available for atp synthesis the main energyyielding foodscarbohydrates and fatsare reservoirs of electrons associated with hydrogen,catabolic pathways are metabolic processes that release energy by breaking down complex organic molecules into simpler waste products this energy primarily stored in the bonds of these molecules is harnessed by cells through cellular respiration key concepts include catabolic pathways degrade complex organic molecules to extract energy cellular respiration encompasses both aerobic requiring oxygen and anaerobic without oxygen processes to generate atp the energy currency of cells redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons where oxidation refers to the loss of electrons and reduction refers to the gain of electrons for example during respiration glucose is oxidized and oxygen is reduced energy transfer the process converts potential energy from organic fuels into usable energy primarily in the form of atp while releasing byproducts like carbon dioxide and water in summary catabolic pathways play a crucial role in energy production enabling cells to perform work by breaking down organic compounds and transferring electrons during redox reactions
only the barrier of activation energy holds back the flood of electrons to a lower energy state see figure 813 without this barrier a food substance like glucose would combine almost instantaneously with o2 if we supply the activation energy by igniting glucose it burns in air releasing 686 kcal 2870 kj of heat per mole of glucose about 180 g body temperature is not high enough to initiate burning of course instead if you swallow some glucose enzymes in your cells will lower the barrier of activation energy allowing the sugar to be oxidized in a series of steps stepwise energy harvest via nad and the electron transport chain if energy is released from a fuel all at once it cannot be harnessed efficiently for constructive work for example if a gasoline tank explodes it cannot drive a car very far cellular respiration does not oxidize glucose or any other organic fuel in a single explosive step either rather glucose is broken down in a series of steps each one catalyzed by an enzyme at key steps electrons are stripped from the glucose as is often the case in oxidation reactions each electron travels with a protonthus as a hydrogen atom the hydrogen atoms are not transferred directly to oxygen but instead are usually passed first to an electron carrier a coenzyme called nad nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide a derivative of the vitamin niacin nad is well suited as an electron carrier because it can cycle easily between oxidized nad and reduced nadh states as an electron acceptor nad functions as an oxidizing agent during respiration how does nad trap electrons from glucose and the other organic molecules in food enzymes called dehydrogenases remove a pair of hydrogen atoms 2 electrons and 2 protons from the substrate glucose in the above example thereby oxidizing it the enzyme delivers the 2 electrons along with 1 proton to its coenzyme nad figure 94 the other proton is released as a hydrogen ion h into the surrounding solution h c oh nad dehydrogenase c o nadh h by receiving 2 negatively charged electrons but only 1 positively charged proton the nicotinamide portion of nad has its charge neutralized when nad is reduced to nadh the name nadh shows the hydrogen that has been received in the reaction nad is the most versatile electron acceptor in cellular respiration and functions in several of the redox steps during the breakdown of glucose electrons lose very little of their potential energy when they are transferred from glucose to nad each nadh molecule formed during respiration represents stored energy this energy can be tapped to make atp when the electrons complete their fall in a series of steps down an energy gradient from nadh to oxygen how do electrons that are extracted from glucose and stored as potential energy in nadh finally reach oxygen it will help to compare the redox chemistry of cellular respiration to a much simpler reaction the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to form water figure 95a mix h2 and o2 provide a spark for activation energy and the gases combine explosively in fact combustion of liquid h2 and o2 was harnessed to help power the main engines of the space shuttle boosting it into orbit the explosion represents a release of energy as the electrons of hydrogen fall closer to the electronegative oxygen atoms cellular respiration also brings hydrogen and oxygen together to form water but there are two important differences first in cellular respiration the hydrogen that reacts with oxygen is derived from organic molecules rather than h2 second instead of occurring in one explosive reaction respiration uses an electron transport chain to break the fall of electrons to oxygen into several energyreleasing steps figure 95b an electron transport chain consists of a number of molecules mostly proteins built into the inner membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells and the plasma membrane of respiring prokaryotes electrons removed from glucose are shuttled by nadh to the top higherenergy end of the chain at the bottom lowerenergy end o2 captures these electrons along with hydrogen nuclei h forming water anaerobically respiring prokaryotes have an electron acceptor at the end of the chain that is different from o2 electron transfer from nadh to oxygen is an exergonic reaction with a freeenergy change of 53 kcalmol 222 kjmol instead of this energy being released and wasted in a single explosive step electrons cascade down the chain from one carrier molecule to the next in a series of redox reactions losing a small amount of energy with each step until they finally reach oxygen the terminal electron acceptor which has a very great affinity for electrons each downhill carrier is more electronegative than and thus capable of oxidizing its uphill neighbor with oxygen at the bottom of the chain therefore the electrons transferred from glucose to nad which is thus reduced to nadh fall down an energy gradient in the electron transport chain to a far more stable location in the electronegative oxygen atom put another way oxygen pulls electrons down the chain in an energyyielding tumble analogous to gravity pulling objects downhill in summary during cellular respiration most electrons travel the following downhill route glucose s nadh s electron transport chain s oxygen later in this chapter you will learn more about how the cell uses the energy released from this exergonic electron fall to regenerate its supply of atp for now having covered the basic redox mechanisms of cellular respiration lets look at the entire process by which energy is harvested from organic fuels the stages of cellular respiration a preview the harvesting of energy from glucose by cellular respiration is a cumulative function of three metabolic stages we list them here along with a colorcoding scheme we will use throughout the chapter to help you keep track of the big picture biochemists usually reserve the term cellular respiration for stages 2 and 3 together in this text however we include glycolysis as a part of cellular respiration because most respiring cells deriving energy from glucose use glycolysis to produce the starting material for the citric acid cycle as diagrammed in figure 96 glycolysis and pyruvate oxidation followed by the citric acid cycle are the catabolic pathways that break down glucose and other organic fuels glycolysis which occurs in the cytosol begins the degradation process by breaking glucose into two molecules of a compound called pyruvate in eukaryotes pyruvate enters the mitochondrion and is oxidized to a compound called acetyl coa which enters the citric acid cycle there the breakdown of glucose to carbon dioxide is completed in prokaryotes these processes take place in the cytosol thus the carbon dioxide produced by respiration represents fragments of oxidized organic molecules some of the steps of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle are redox reactions in which dehydrogenases transfer electrons from substrates to nad forming nadh in the third stage of respiration the electron transport chain accepts electrons most often via nadh from the breakdown products of the first two stages and passes these electrons from one molecule to another at the end of the chain the electrons are combined with molecular oxygen and hydrogen ions h forming water see figure 95b the energy released at each step of the chain is stored in a form the mitochondrion or prokaryotic cell can use to make atp from adp this mode of atp synthesis is called oxidative phosphorylation because it is powered by the redox reactions of the electron transport chain in eukaryotic cells the inner membrane of the mitochondrion is the site of electron transport and chemiosmosis the processes that together constitute oxidative phosphorylation in prokaryotes these processes take place in the plasma membrane oxidative phosphorylation accounts for almost 90 of the atp generated by respiration a smaller amount of atp is formed directly in a few reactions of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle by a mechanism called substratelevel phosphorylation figure 97 this mode of atp synthesis occurs when an enzyme transfers a phosphate group from a substrate molecule to adp rather than adding an inorganic phosphate to adp as in oxidative phosphorylation substrate molecule here refers to an organic molecule generated as an intermediate during the catabolism of glucose youll see examples of substratelevel phosphorylation later in the chapter in both glycolysis and the citric acid cycle when you withdraw a relatively large sum of money from an atm machine it is not delivered to you in a single bill of larger denomination instead a number of smaller denomination bills are dispensed that you can spend more easily this is analogous to atp production during cellular respiration for each molecule of glucose degraded to carbon dioxide and water by respiration the cell makes up to about 32 molecules of atp each with 73 kcalmol of free energy respiration cashes in the large denomination of energy banked in a single molecule of glucose 686 kcalmol for the small change of many molecules of atp which is more practical for the cell to spend on its work this preview has introduced you to how glycolysis the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation fit into the process of cellular respiration we are now ready to take a closer look at each of these three stages of respiration,cellular respiration is a multistep process where glucose is broken down to release energy for cellular activities this begins with glycolysis where glucose is split into two molecules of pyruvate in the cytosol pyruvate then moves into the mitochondria where it is converted to acetyl coa entering the citric acid cycle during this cycle electrons are stripped from organic molecules and transferred to nad forming nadh a carrier of stored energy the electron transport chain then receives these electrons from nadh passing them through a series of molecules embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane this transfer releases energy which is used to produce atp through a process called oxidative phosphorylation oxygen acts as the final electron acceptor combining with hydrogen to form water the gradual stepwise release of energy ensures that the energy from glucose is harnessed efficiently with up to 32 molecules of atp produced per glucose molecule this controlled breakdown prevents an explosive energy release and enables cells to perform work
glycolysis harvests chemical energy by oxidizing glucose to pyruvate the word glycolysis means sugar splitting and that is exactly what happens during this pathway glucose a six carbon sugar is split into two threecarbon sugars these smaller sugars are then oxidized and their remaining atoms rearranged to form two molecules of pyruvate pyruvate is the ionized form of pyruvic acid as summarized in figure 98 glycolysis can be divided into two phases the energy investment phase and the energy payoff phase during the energy investment phase the cell actually spends atp this investment is repaid with interest during the energy payoff phase when atp is produced by substratelevel phosphorylation and nad is reduced to nadh by electrons released from the oxidation of glucose the net energy yield from glycolysis per glucose molecule is 2 atp plus 2 nadh the ten steps of the glycolytic pathway are shown in figure 99 all of the carbon originally present in glucose is accounted for in the two molecules of pyruvate no carbon is released as co2 during glycolysis glycolysis occurs whether or not o2 is present however if o2 is present the chemical energy stored in pyruvate and nadh can be extracted by pyruvate oxidation the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation,glycolysis is a metabolic process where glucose a sixcarbon sugar is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate a threecarbon compound this process involves two phases the energy investment phase where the cell uses atp to start glycolysis and the energy payoff phase where atp is produced through substratelevel phosphorylation and nad is reduced to nadh by gaining electrons from glucose oxidation the overall energy yield per glucose molecule is 2 atp and 2 nadh glycolysis occurs with or without oxygen but in the presence of oxygen further energy can be extracted from pyruvate through pyruvate oxidation the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation no carbon is lost as co during glycolysis and all carbon from glucose is accounted for in pyruvate
after pyruvate is oxidized the citric acid cycle completes the energyyielding oxidation of organic molecules glycolysis releases less than a quarter of the chemical energy in glucose that can be harvested by cells most of the energy remains stockpiled in the two molecules of pyruvate when o2 is present the pyruvate in eukaryotic cells enters a mitochondrion where the oxidation of glucose is completed in aerobically respiring prokaryotic cells this process occurs in the cytosol later in the chapter well discuss what happens to pyruvate when o2 is unavailable or in a prokaryote that is unable to use o2 oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl coa upon entering the mitochondrion via active transport pyruvate is first converted to a compound called acetyl coenzyme a or acetyl coa figure 910 this step linking glycolysis and the citric acid cycle is carried out by a multienzyme complex that catalyzes three reactions 1 pyruvates carboxyl group coo which is already fully oxidized and thus has little chemical energy is removed and given off as a molecule of co2 this is the first step in which co2 is released during respiration 2 the remaining twocarbon fragment is oxidized forming acetate ch3coo which is the ionized form of acetic acid the extracted electrons are transferred to nad storing energy in the form of nadh 3 finally coenzyme a coa a sulfurcontaining compound derived from a b vitamin is attached via its sulfur atom to the acetate forming acetyl coa which has a high potential energy in other words the reaction of acetyl coa to yield lowerenergy products is highly exergonic this molecule will now feed its acetyl group into the citric acid cycle for further oxidation the citric acid cycle the citric acid cycle functions as a metabolic furnace that oxidizes organic fuel derived from pyruvate figure 911 summarizes the inputs and outputs as pyruvate is broken down to three co2 molecules including the molecule of co2 released during the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl coa the cycle generates 1 atp per turn by substratelevel phosphorylation but most of the chemical energy is transferred to nad and a related electron carrier the coenzyme fad flavin adenine dinucleotide derived from riboflavin a b vitamin during the redox reactions the reduced coenzymes nadh and fadh2 shuttle their cargo of highenergy electrons into the electron transport chain the citric acid cycle is also called the tricarboxylic acid cycle or the krebs cycle the latter honoring hans krebs the germanbritish scientist who was largely responsible for working out the pathway in the 1930s now lets look at the citric acid cycle in more detail the cycle has eight steps each catalyzed by a specific enzyme you can see in figure 912 that for each turn of the citric acid cycle two carbons red enter in the relatively reduced form of an acetyl group step 1 and two different carbons blue leave in the completely oxidized form of co2 molecules steps 3 and 4 the acetyl group of acetyl coa joins the cycle by combining with the compound oxaloacetate forming citrate step 1 citrate is the ionized form of citric acid for which the cycle is named the next seven steps decompose the citrate back to oxaloacetate it is this regeneration of oxaloacetate that makes the process a cycle we can refer to figure 912 in order to tally the energyrich molecules produced by the citric acid cycle for each acetyl group entering the cycle 3 nad are reduced to nadh steps 3 4 and 8 in step 6 electrons are transferred not to nad but to fad which accepts 2 electrons and 2 protons to become fadh2 in many animal tissue cells the reaction in step 5 produces a guanosine triphosphate gtp molecule by substratelevel phosphorylation gtp is a molecule similar to atp in its structure and cellular function this gtp may be used to make an atp molecule as shown or directly power work in the cell in the cells of plants bacteria and some animal tissues step 5 forms an atp molecule directly by substratelevel phosphorylation the output from step 5 represents the only atp generated during the citric acid cycle recall that each glucose gives rise to two acetyl coas that enter the cycle because the numbers noted earlier are obtained from a single acetyl group entering the pathway the total yield per glucose from the citric acid cycle turns out to be 6 nadhs 2 fadh2s and the equivalent of 2 atps most of the atp produced by respiration results from oxidative phosphorylation when the nadh and fadh2 produced by the citric acid cycle relay the electrons extracted from food to the electron transport chain in the process they supply the necessary energy for the phosphorylation of adp to atp we will explore this process in the next section,after glycolysis most of the chemical energy from glucose remains in the two pyruvate molecules in the presence of oxygen pyruvate enters the mitochondrion in eukaryotic cells or stays in the cytosol in prokaryotes to be further oxidized the pyruvate is converted into acetyl coa through a series of reactions the carboxyl group of pyruvate is removed as co the remaining twocarbon fragment forms acetate and coenzyme a binds to form acetyl coa this highenergy molecule enters the citric acid cycle also known as the krebs cycle in the citric acid cycle acetyl coa combines with oxaloacetate to form citrate the cycle involves eight enzymecatalyzed steps that progressively break down citrate regenerating oxaloacetate and releasing two molecules of co throughout the cycle energy is stored by reducing nad to nadh and fad to fadh a single turn of the cycle generates 3 nadh 1 fadh and 1 atp or gtp in some cells the nadh and fadh produced transport highenergy electrons to the electron transport chain where most atp is synthesized during oxidative phosphorylation for each glucose molecule the citric acid cycle yields a total of 6 nadh 2 fadh and 2 atp molecules
during oxidative phosphorylation chemiosmosis couples electron transport to atp synthesis our main objective in this chapter is to learn how cells harvest the energy of glucose and other nutrients in food to make atp but the metabolic components of respiration we have dissected so far glycolysis and the citric acid cycle produce only 4 atp molecules per glucose molecule all by substratelevel phosphorylation 2 net atp from glycolysis and 2 atp from the citric acid cycle at this point molecules of nadh and fadh2 account for most of the energy extracted from each glucose molecule these electron escorts link glycolysis and the citric acid cycle to the machinery of oxidative phosphorylation which uses energy released by the electron transport chain to power atp synthesis in this section you will learn first how the electron transport chain works and then how electron flow down the chain is coupled to atp synthesis the pathway of electron transport the electron transport chain is a collection of molecules embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion in eukaryotic cells in prokaryotes these molecules reside in the plasma membrane the folding of the inner membrane to form cristae increases its surface area providing space for thousands of copies of the electron transport chain in each mitochondrion once again we see that structure fits functionthe infolded membrane with its placement of electron carrier molecules in a row one after the other is wellsuited for the series of sequential redox reactions that take place along the electron transport chain most components of the chain are proteins which exist in multiprotein complexes numbered i through iv tightly bound to these proteins are prosthetic groups nonprotein components essential for the catalytic functions of certain enzymes now lets take a closer look at the electron transport chain in figure 913 well first describe the passage of electrons through complex i in some detail as an illustration of the general principles involved in electron transport electrons acquired from glucose by nad during glycolysis and the citric acid cycle are transferred from nadh to the first molecule of the electron transport chain in complex i this molecule is a flavoprotein so named because it has a prosthetic group called flavin mononucleotide fmn in the next redox reaction the flavoprotein returns to its oxidized form as it passes electrons to an ironsulfur protein fes in complex i one of a family of proteins with both iron and sulfur tightly bound the ironsulfur protein then passes the electrons to a compound called ubiquinone q in figure 913 this electron carrier is a small hydrophobic molecule the only member of the electron transport chain that is not a protein ubiquinone is individually mobile within the membrane rather than residing in a particular complex another name for ubiquinone is coenzyme q or coq you may have seen it sold as a nutritional supplement in health food stores most of the remaining electron carriers between ubiquinone and oxygen are proteins called cytochromes their prosthetic group called a heme group has an iron atom that accepts and donates electrons the heme group in the cytochromes is similar to the heme group in hemoglobin the protein of red blood cells except that the iron in hemoglobin carries oxygen not electrons the electron transport chain has several types of cytochromes each a different protein with a slightly different electroncarrying heme group the last cytochrome of the chain cyt a3 passes its electrons to oxygen which is very electronegative each oxygen atom also picks up a pair of hydrogen ions protons from the aqueous solution neutralizing the 2 charge of the added electrons and forming water another source of electrons for the transport chain is fadh2 the other reduced product of the citric acid cycle notice in figure 913 that fadh2 adds its electrons to the electron transport chain from within complex ii at a lower energy level than nadh does consequently although nadh and fadh2 each donate an equivalent number of electrons 2 for oxygen reduction the electron transport chain provides about onethird less energy for atp synthesis when the electron donor is fadh2 rather than nadh well see why in the next section the electron transport chain makes no atp directly instead it eases the fall of electrons from food to oxygen breaking a large freeenergy drop into a series of smaller steps that release energy in manageable amounts step by step how does the mitochondrion or the plasma membrane in the case of prokaryotes couple this electron transport and energy release to atp synthesis the answer is a mechanism called chemiosmosis chemiosmosis the energycoupling mechanism populating the inner membrane of the mitochondrion or the prokaryotic plasma membrane are many copies of a protein complex called atp synthase the enzyme that makes atp from adp and inorganic phosphate figure 914 atp synthase works like an ion pump running in reverse ion pumps usually use atp as an energy source to transport ions against their gradients enzymes can catalyze a reaction in either direction depending on the g for the reaction which is affected by the local concentrations of reactants and products see chapter 8 rather than hydrolyzing atp to pump protons against their concentration gradient under the conditions of cellular respiration atp synthase uses the energy of an existing ion gradient to power atp synthesis the power source for atp synthase is a difference in the concentration of h on opposite sides of the inner mitochondrial membrane this process in which energy stored in the form of a hydrogen ion gradient across a membrane is used to drive cellular work such as the synthesis of atp is called chemiosmosis from the greek osmos push we have previously used the word osmosis in discussing water transport but here it refers to the flow of h across a membrane from studying the structure of atp synthase scientists have learned how the flow of h through this large enzyme powers atp generation atp synthase is a multisubunit complex with four main parts each made up of multiple polypeptides protons move one by one into binding sites on one of the parts the rotor causing it to spin in a way that catalyzes atp production from adp and inorganic phosphate the flow of protons thus behaves somewhat like a rushing stream that turns a waterwheel how does the inner mitochondrial membrane or the prokaryotic plasma membrane generate and maintain the h gradient that drives atp synthesis by the atp synthase protein complex establishing the h gradient is a major function of the electron transport chain which is shown in its mitochondrial location in figure 915 the chain is an energy converter that uses the exergonic flow of electrons from nadh and fadh2 to pump h across the membrane from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space the h has a tendency to move back across the membrane diffusing down its gradient and the atp synthases are the only sites that provide a route through the membrane for h as we described previously the passage of h through atp synthase uses the exergonic flow of h to drive the phosphorylation of adp thus the energy stored in an h gradient across a membrane couples the redox reactions of the electron transport chain to atp at this point you may be wondering how the electron transport chain pumps hydrogen ions researchers have found that certain members of the electron transport chain accept and release protons h along with electrons the aqueous solutions inside and surrounding the cell are a ready source of h at certain steps along the chain electron transfers cause h to be taken up and released into the surrounding solution in eukaryotic cells the electron carriers are spatially arranged in the inner mitochondrial membrane in such a way that h is accepted from the mitochondrial matrix and deposited in the intermembrane space see figure 915 the h gradient that results is referred to as a protonmotive force emphasizing the capacity of the gradient to perform work the force drives h back across the membrane through the h channels provided by atp synthases in general terms chemiosmosis is an energycoupling mechanism that uses energy stored in the form of an h gradient across a membrane to drive cellular work in mitochondria the energy for gradient formation comes from exergonic redox reactions and atp synthesis is the work performed but chemiosmosis also occurs elsewhere and in other variations chloroplasts use chemiosmosis to generate atp during photosynthesis in these organelles light rather than chemical energy drives both electron flow down an electron transport chain and the resulting h gradient formation prokaryotes as already mentioned generate h gradients across their plasma membranes they then tap the protonmotive force not only to make atp inside the cell but also to rotate their flagella and to pump nutrients and waste products across the membrane because of its central importance to energy conversions in prokaryotes and eukaryotes chemiosmosis has helped unify the study of bioenergetics peter mitchell was awarded the nobel prize in 1978 for originally proposing the chemiosmotic model,oxidative phosphorylation is a critical stage in cellular respiration where chemiosmosis couples the movement of electrons along the electron transport chain to the production of atp the earlier stages of respiration glycolysis and the citric acid cycle only generate 4 atp molecules per glucose by substratelevel phosphorylation while most of the energy is stored in nadh and fadh these energyrich molecules donate electrons to the electron transport chain which is embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane in eukaryotic cells as electrons flow through a series of proteins including cytochromes they lose energy which is used to pump h ions from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space creating a proton gradient this protonmotive force drives h ions back across the membrane through the enzyme atp synthase which uses this flow to convert adp and inorganic phosphate into atp the cells energy currency this process known as chemiosmosis is vital for energy production and occurs not only in mitochondria but also in chloroplasts during photosynthesis and in the plasma membranes of prokaryotic cells
an accounting of atp production by cellular respiration in the last few sections we have looked rather closely at the key processes of cellular respiration now lets take a step back and remind ourselves of its overall function harvesting the energy of glucose for atp synthesis during respiration most energy flows in this sequence glucose s nadh s electron transport chain s protonmotive force s atp we can do some bookkeeping to calculate the atp profit when cellular respiration oxidizes a molecule of glucose to six molecules of carbon dioxide the three main departments of this metabolic enterprise are glycolysis pyruvate oxidation and the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain which drives oxidative phosphorylation figure 916 gives a detailed accounting of the atp yield for each glucose molecule that is oxidized the tally adds the 4 atp produced directly by substratelevel phosphorylation during glycolysis and the citric acid cycle to the many more molecules of atp generated by oxidative phosphorylation each nadh that transfers a pair of electrons from glucose to the electron transport chain contributes enough to the protonmotive force to generate a maximum of about 3 atp why are the numbers in figure 916 inexact there are three reasons we cannot state an exact number of atp molecules generated by the breakdown of one molecule of glucose first phosphorylation and the redox reactions are not directly coupled to each other so the ratio of the number of nadh molecules to the number of atp molecules is not a whole number we know that 1 nadh results in 10 h being transported out across the inner mitochondrial membrane but the exact number of h that must reenter the mitochondrial matrix via atp synthase to generate 1 atp has long been debated based on experimental data however most biochemists now agree that the most accurate number is 4 h therefore a single molecule of nadh generates enough protonmotive force for the synthesis of 25 atp the citric acid cycle also supplies electrons to the electron transport chain via fadh2 but since its electrons enter later in the chain each molecule of this electron carrier is responsible for transport of only enough h for the synthesis of 15 atp these numbers also take into account the slight energetic cost of moving the atp formed in the mitochondrion out into the cytosol where it will be used second the atp yield varies slightly depending on the type of shuttle used to transport electrons from the cytosol into the mitochondrion the mitochondrial inner membrane is impermeable to nadh so nadh in the cytosol is segregated from the machinery of oxidative phosphorylation the 2 electrons of nadh captured in glycolysis must be conveyed into the mitochondrion by one of several electron shuttle systems depending on the kind of shuttle in a particular cell type the electrons are passed either to nad or to fad in the mitochondrial matrix see figure 916 if the electrons are passed to fad as in brain cells only about 15 atp can result from each nadh that was originally generated in the cytosol if the electrons are passed to mitochondrial nad as in liver cells and heart cells the yield is about 25 atp per nadh a third variable that reduces the yield of atp is the use of the protonmotive force generated by the redox reactions of respiration to drive other kinds of work for example the protonmotive force powers the mitochondrions uptake of pyruvate from the cytosol however if all the protonmotive force generated by the electron transport chain were used to drive atp synthesis one glucose molecule could generate a maximum of 28 atp produced by oxidative phosphorylation plus 4 atp net from substratelevel phosphorylation to give a total yield of about 32 atp or only about 30 atp if the less efficient shuttle were functioning we can now roughly estimate the efficiency of respiration that is the percentage of chemical energy in glucose that has been transferred to atp recall that the complete oxidation of a mole of glucose releases 686 kcal of energy under standard conditions g 686 kcalmol phosphorylation of adp to form atp stores at least 73 kcal per mole of atp therefore the efficiency of respiration is 73 kcal per mole of atp times 32 moles of atp per mole of glucose divided by 686 kcal per mole of glucose which equals 034 thus about 34 of the potential chemical energy in glucose has been transferred to atp the actual percentage is bound to vary as g varies under different cellular conditions cellular respiration is remarkably efficient in its energy conversion by comparison even the most efficient automobile converts only about 25 of the energy stored in gasoline to energy that moves the car the rest of the energy stored in glucose is lost as heat we humans use some of this heat to maintain our relatively high body temperature 37c and we dissipate the rest through sweating and other cooling mechanisms surprisingly perhaps it may be beneficial under certain conditions to reduce the efficiency of cellular respiration a remarkable adaptation is shown by hibernating mammals which overwinter in a state of inactivity and lowered metabolism although their internal body temperature is lower than normal it still must be kept significantly higher than the external air temperature one type of tissue called brown fat is made up of cells packed full of mitochondria the inner mitochondrial membrane contains a channel protein called the uncoupling protein that allows protons to flow back down their concentration gradient without generating atp activation of these proteins in hibernating mammals results in ongoing oxidation of stored fuel stores fats generating heat without any atp production in the absence of such an adaptation the buildup of atp would eventually cause cellular respiration to be shut down by regulatory mechanisms that will be discussed later in the scientific skills exercise you can work with data in a related but different case where a decrease in metabolic efficiency in cells is used to generate heat,cellular respiration is the process through which cells convert glucose into adenosine triphosphate atp the energy currency of the cell this multistep process consists of three main stages glycolysis occurring in the cytoplasm glycolysis breaks down one glucose molecule into two pyruvate molecules generating a net gain of 2 atp and 2 nadh pyruvate oxidation and citric acid cycle in the mitochondria pyruvate is further oxidized to acetylcoa the citric acid cycle processes this acetylcoa producing additional nadh fadh and 2 atp through substratelevel phosphorylation oxidative phosphorylation this final stage occurs in the inner mitochondrial membrane where electrons from nadh and fadh flow through the electron transport chain creating a protonmotive force that drives atp synthase to generate atp each nadh yields approximately 25 atp while fadh produces about 15 atp the total atp yield from one glucose molecule ranges from 30 to 32 atp representing about 34 efficiency in energy conversion in certain organisms such as hibernating mammals uncoupling proteins can reduce this efficiency allowing heat production without atp generation essential for maintaining body temperature during inactivity
fermentation and anaerobic respiration enable cells to produce atp without the use of oxygen because most of the atp generated by cellular respiration is due to the work of oxidative phosphorylation our estimate of atp yield from aerobic respiration is contingent on an adequate supply of oxygen to the cell without the electronegative oxygen to pull electrons down the transport chain oxidative phosphorylation eventually ceases however there are two general mechanisms by which certain cells can oxidize organic fuel and generate atp without the use of oxygen anaerobic respiration and fermentation the distinction between these two is that an electron transport chain is used in anaerobic respiration but not in fermentation the electron transport chain is also called the respiratory chain because of its role in both types of cellular respiration we have already mentioned anaerobic respiration which takes place in certain prokaryotic organisms that live in environments without oxygen these organisms have an electron transport chain but do not use oxygen as a final electron acceptor at the end of the chain oxygen performs this function very well because it is extremely electronegative but other less electronegative substances can also serve as final electron acceptors some sulfatereducing marine bacteria for instance use the sulfate ion so42 at the end of their respiratory chain operation of the chain builds up a protonmotive force used to produce atp but h2s hydrogen sulfide is made as a byproduct rather than water the rottenegg odor you may have smelled while walking through a salt marsh or a mudflat signals the presence of sulfatereducing bacteria fermentation is a way of harvesting chemical energy without using either oxygen or any electron transport chainin other words without cellular respiration how can food be oxidized without cellular respiration remember oxidation simply refers to the loss of electrons to an electron acceptor so it does not need to involve oxygen glycolysis oxidizes glucose to two molecules of pyruvate the oxidizing agent of glycolysis is nad and neither oxygen nor any electron transfer chain is involved overall glycolysis is exergonic and some of the energy made available is used to produce 2 atp net by substratelevel phosphorylation if oxygen is present then additional atp is made by oxidative phosphorylation when nadh passes electrons removed from glucose to the electron transport chain but glycolysis generates 2 atp whether oxygen is present or notthat is whether conditions are aerobic or anaerobic as an alternative to respiratory oxidation of organic nutrients fermentation is an extension of glycolysis that allows continuous generation of atp by the substratelevel phosphorylation of glycolysis for this to occur there must be a sufficient supply of nad to accept electrons during the oxidation step of glycolysis without some mechanism to recycle nad from nadh glycolysis would soon deplete the cells pool of nad by reducing it all to nadh and would shut itself down for lack of an oxidizing agent under aerobic conditions nad is recycled from nadh by the transfer of electrons to the electron transport chain an anaerobic alternative is to transfer electrons from nadh to pyruvate the end product of glycolysis types of fermentation fermentation consists of glycolysis plus reactions that regenerate nad by transferring electrons from nadh to pyruvate or derivatives of pyruvate the nad can then be reused to oxidize sugar by glycolysis which nets two molecules of atp by substratelevel phosphorylation there are many types of fermentation differing in the end products formed from pyruvate two types commonly harnessed by humans for food and industrial production are alcohol fermentation and lactic acid fermentation in alcohol fermentation figure 917a pyruvate is converted to ethanol ethyl alcohol in two steps the first step releases carbon dioxide from the pyruvate which is converted to the twocarbon compound acetaldehyde in the second step acetaldehyde is reduced by nadh to ethanol this regenerates the supply of nad needed for the continuation of glycolysis many bacteria carry out alcohol fermentation under anaerobic conditions yeast a fungus also carries out alcohol fermentation for thousands of years humans have used yeast in brewing winemaking and baking the co2 bubbles generated by bakers yeast during alcohol fermentation allow bread to rise during lactic acid fermentation figure 917b pyruvate is reduced directly by nadh to form lactate as an end product with no release of co2 lactate is the ionized form of lactic acid lactic acid fermentation by certain fungi and bacteria is used in the dairy industry to make cheese and yogurt human muscle cells make atp by lactic acid fermentation when oxygen is scarce this occurs during strenuous exercise when sugar catabolism for atp production outpaces the muscles supply of oxygen from the blood under these conditions the cells switch from aerobic respiration to fermentation the lactate that accumulates was previously thought to cause muscle fatigue and pain but recent research suggests instead that increased levels of potassium ions k may be to blame while lactate appears to enhance muscle performance in any case the excess lactate is gradually carried away by the blood to the liver where it is converted back to pyruvate by liver cells because oxygen is available this pyruvate can then enter the mitochondria in liver cells and complete cellular respiration,fermentation and anaerobic respiration are crucial metabolic processes that enable cells to produce atp without relying on oxygen anaerobic respiration this process utilizes an electron transport chain but does not use oxygen as the final electron acceptor instead less electronegative substances such as sulfate ions can be used for example sulfatereducing bacteria in oxygendeprived environments convert sulfate into hydrogen sulfide contributing to the characteristic smell of rotten eggs fermentation unlike anaerobic respiration fermentation occurs without an electron transport chain it is an extension of glycolysis where glucose is broken down into pyruvate generating 2 atp through substratelevel phosphorylation to maintain the glycolytic pathway nad must be regenerated from nadh this occurs by transferring electrons from nadh to pyruvate types of fermentation alcohol fermentation in this twostep process pyruvate is converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide allowing organisms like yeast to produce energy without oxygen this method is widely used in baking and brewing lactic acid fermentation here pyruvate is directly reduced to lactate which occurs in human muscle cells during strenuous exercise when oxygen is limited lactate can enhance muscle performance and is eventually converted back to pyruvate in the liver when oxygen becomes available these adaptive processes illustrate how cells can efficiently generate energy in the absence of oxygen highlighting the versatility of metabolic pathways
glycolysis and the citric acid cycle connect to many other metabolic pathways so far we have treated the oxidative breakdown of glucose in isolation from the cells overall metabolic economy in this section you will learn that glycolysis and the citric acid cycle are major intersections of the cells catabolic breakdown and anabolic biosynthetic pathways the versatility of catabolism throughout this chapter we have used glucose as an example of a fuel for cellular respiration but free glucose molecules are not common in the diets of humans and other animals we obtain most of our calories in the form of fats proteins sucrose and other disaccharides and starch a polysaccharide all these organic molecules in food can be used by cellular respiration to make atp figure 919 glycolysis can accept a wide range of carbohydrates for catabolism in the digestive tract starch is hydrolyzed to glucose which can then be broken down in the cells by glycolysis and the citric acid cycle similarly glycogen the polysaccharide that humans and many other animals store in their liver and muscle cells can be hydrolyzed to glucose between meals as fuel for respiration the digestion of disaccharides including sucrose provides glucose and other monosaccharides as fuel for respiration proteins can also be used for fuel but first they must be digested to their constituent amino acids many of the amino acids are used by the organism to build new proteins amino acids present in excess are converted by enzymes to intermediates of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle before amino acids can feed into glycolysis or the citric acid cycle their amino groups must be removed a process called deamination the nitrogenous refuse is excreted from the animal in the form of ammonia nh3 urea or other waste products catabolism can also harvest energy stored in fats obtained either from food or from storage cells in the body after fats are digested to glycerol and fatty acids the glycerol is converted to glyceraldehyde 3phosphate an intermediate of glycolysis most of the energy of a fat is stored in the fatty acids a metabolic sequence called beta oxidation breaks the fatty acids down to twocarbon fragments which enter the citric acid cycle as acetyl coa nadh and fadh2 are also generated during beta oxidation they can enter the electron transport chain leading to further atp production fats make excellent fuels in large part due to their chemical structure and the high energy level of their electrons equally shared between carbon and hydrogen compared to those of carbohydrates a gram of fat oxidized by respiration produces more than twice as much atp as a gram of carbohydrate unfortunately this also means that a person trying to lose weight must work hard to use up fat stored in the body because so many calories are stockpiled in each gram of fat biosynthesis anabolic pathways cells need substance as well as energy not all the organic molecules of food are destined to be oxidized as fuel to make atp in addition to calories food must also provide the carbon skeletons that cells require to make their own molecules some organic monomers obtained from digestion can be used directly for example as previously mentioned amino acids from the hydrolysis of proteins in food can be incorporated into the organisms own proteins often however the body needs specific molecules that are not present as such in food compounds formed as intermediates of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle can be diverted into anabolic pathways as precursors from which the cell can synthesize the molecules it requires for example humans can make about half of the 20 amino acids in proteins by modifying compounds siphoned away from the citric acid cycle the rest are essential amino acids that must be obtained in the diet also glucose can be made from pyruvate and fatty acids can be synthesized from acetyl coa of course these anabolic or biosynthetic pathways do not generate atp but instead consume it in addition glycolysis and the citric acid cycle function as metabolic interchanges that enable our cells to convert some kinds of molecules to others as we need them for example an intermediate compound generated during glycolysis dihydroxyacetone phosphate see figure 99 step 5 can be converted to one of the major precursors of fats if we eat more food than we need we store fat even if our diet is fatfree metabolism is remarkably versatile and adaptable regulation of cellular respiration via feedback mechanisms basic principles of supply and demand regulate the metabolic economy the cell does not waste energy making more of a particular substance than it needs if there is a glut of a certain amino acid for example the anabolic pathway that synthesizes that amino acid from an intermediate of the citric acid cycle is switched off the most common mechanism for this control is feedback inhibition the end product of the anabolic pathway inhibits the enzyme that catalyzes an early step of the pathway see figure 821 this prevents the needless diversion of key metabolic intermediates from uses that are more urgent the cell also controls its catabolism if the cell is working hard and its atp concentration begins to drop respiration speeds up when there is plenty of atp to meet demand respiration slows down sparing valuable organic molecules for other functions again control is based mainly on regulating the activity of enzymes at strategic points in the catabolic pathway as shown in figure 920 one important switch is phosphofructokinase the enzyme that catalyzes step 3 of glycolysis see figure 99 that is the first step that commits the substrate irreversibly to the glycolytic pathway by controlling the rate of this step the cell can speed up or slow down the entire catabolic process phosphofructokinase can thus be considered the pacemaker of respiration phosphofructokinase is an allosteric enzyme with receptor sites for specific inhibitors and activators it is inhibited by atp and stimulated by amp adenosine monophosphate which the cell derives from adp as atp accumulates inhibition of the enzyme slows down glycolysis the enzyme becomes active again as cellular work converts atp to adp and amp faster than atp is being regenerated phosphofructokinase is also sensitive to citrate the first product of the citric acid cycle if citrate accumulates in mitochondria some of it passes into the cytosol and inhibits phosphofructokinase this mechanism helps synchronize the rates of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle as citrate accumulates glycolysis slows down and the supply of acetyl groups to the citric acid cycle decreases if citrate consumption increases either because of a demand for more atp or because anabolic pathways are draining off intermediates of the citric acid cycle glycolysis accelerates and meets the demand metabolic balance is augmented by the control of enzymes that catalyze other key steps of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle cells are thrifty expedient and responsive in their metabolism cellular respiration and metabolic pathways play a role of central importance in organisms examine figure 92 again to put cellular respiration into the broader context of energy flow and chemical cycling in ecosystems the energy that keeps us alive is released not produced by cellular respiration we are tapping energy that was stored in food by photosynthesis in the next chapter you will learn how photosynthesis captures light and converts it to chemical energy,glycolysis and the citric acid cycle are crucial metabolic pathways that connect catabolic energyreleasing and anabolic biosynthetic processes in cells glycolysis breaks down glucose into pyruvate producing atp and nadh which are essential for energy production pyruvate enters the citric acid cycle further generating atp and additional electron carriers like nadh and fadh cells can also utilize fats and proteins for energy fats are digested into glycerol and fatty acids with glycerol entering glycolysis as an intermediate while fatty acids undergo oxidation to form acetyl coa which then enters the citric acid cycle proteins are deaminated to remove amino groups allowing their components to feed into these pathways furthermore glycolysis and the citric acid cycle provide intermediates for anabolic pathways enabling the synthesis of essential molecules like amino acids and fatty acids regulation of these pathways occurs through feedback mechanisms for example phosphofructokinase regulates glycolysis based on atp levels high atp concentrations slow glycolysis conserving resources while low levels accelerate it ensuring the cell efficiently meets its energy demands
the process that feeds the biosphere life on earth is solar powered the chloroplasts in plants and other photosyn thetic organisms capture light energy that has traveled 150 million kilometers from the sun and convert it to chemical energy that is stored in sugar and other organic molecules this conversion process is called photosynthesis lets begin by placing photosynthesis in its ecological context photosynthesis nourishes almost the entire living world directly or indirectly an organism acquires the organic compounds it uses for energy and carbon skeletons by one of two major modes autotrophic nutrition or heterotrophic nutrition autotrophs are selffeeders auto means self and trophos means feeder they sustain themselves without eating anything derived from other living beings autotrophs produce their organic molecules from co2 and other inorganic raw materials obtained from the environment they are the ultimate sources of organic compounds for all nonautotrophic organisms and for this reason biologists refer to autotrophs as the producers of the biosphere almost all plants are autotrophs the only nutrients they require are water and minerals from the soil and carbon dioxide from the air specifically plants are photoautotrophs organisms that use light as a source of energy to synthesize organic substances figure 101 photosynthesis also occurs in algae certain other unicellular eukaryotes and some prokaryotes figure 102 in this chapter we will touch on these other groups in passing but our emphasis will be on plants variations in autotrophic nutrition that occur in prokaryotes and algae will be described in chapters 27 and 28 heterotrophs obtain organic material by the second major mode of nutrition unable to make their own food they live on compounds produced by other organisms heteromeans other heterotrophs are the biospheres consumers the most obvious otherfeeding occurs when an animal eats plants or other animals but heterotrophic nutrition may be more subtle some heterotrophs consume the remains of dead organisms by decomposing and feeding on organic litter such as carcasses feces and fallen leaves these types of organisms are known as decomposers most fungi and many types of prokaryotes get their nourishment this way almost all heterotrophs including humans are completely dependent either directly or indirectly on photoautotrophs for foodand also for oxygen a byproduct of photosynthesis the earths supply of fossil fuels was formed from remains of organisms that died hundreds of millions of years ago in a sense then fossil fuels represent stores of the suns energy from the distant past because these resources are being used at a much higher rate than they are replenished researchers are exploring methods of capitalizing on the photosynthetic process to provide alternative fuels figure 103 in this chapter youll learn how photosynthesis works after discussing general principles of photosynthesis well consider the two stages of photosynthesis the light reactions which capture solar energy and transform it into chemical energy and the calvin cycle which uses that chemical energy to make the organic molecules of food finally we will consider some aspects of photosynthesis from an evolutionary perspective photosynthesis converts light energy to the chemical energy of food the remarkable ability of an organism to harness light energy and use it to drive the synthesis of organic compounds emerges from structural organization in the cell photosynthetic enzymes and other molecules are grouped together in a biological membrane enabling the necessary series of chemical reactions to be carried out efficiently the process of photosynthesis most likely originated in a group of bacteria that had infolded regions of the plasma membrane containing clusters of such molecules in existing photosynthetic bacteria infolded photosynthetic membranes function similarly to the internal membranes of the chloroplast a eukaryotic organelle according to what has come to be known as the endosymbiont theory the original chloroplast was a photosynthetic prokaryote that lived inside an ancestor of eukaryotic cells you learned about this theory in chapter 6 and it will be described more fully in chapter 25 chloroplasts are present in a variety of photosynthesizing organisms see some examples in figure 102 but here we focus on chloroplasts in plants chloroplasts the sites of photosynthesis in plants all green parts of a plant including green stems and unripen fruit have chloroplasts but the leaves are the major sites of photosynthesis in most plants figure 104 there are about half a million chloroplasts in a chunk of leaf with a top surface area of 1 mm2 chloroplasts are found mainly in the cells of the mesophyll the tissue in the interior of the leaf carbon dioxide enters the leaf and oxygen exits by way of microscopic pores called stomata singular stoma from the greek meaning mouth water absorbed by the roots is delivered to the leaves in veins leaves also use veins to export sugar to roots and other no photosynthetic parts of the plant a typical mesophyll cell has about 3040 chloroplasts each measuring about 24 m by 47 m a chloroplast has an envelope of two membranes surrounding a dense fluid called the stroma suspended within the stroma is a third membrane system made up of sacs called thylakoids which segregates the stroma from the thylakoid space inside these sacs in some places thylakoid sacs are stacked in columns called grana singular granum chlorophyll the green pigment that gives leaves their color resides in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast the internal photosynthetic membranes of some prokaryotes are also called thylakoid membranes see figure 278b it is the light energy absorbed by chlorophyll that drives the synthesis of organic molecules in the chloroplast now that we have looked at the sites of photosynthesis in plants we are ready to look more closely at the process of photosynthesis,life on earth is fundamentally solarpowered relying on photosynthesis to convert sunlight into chemical energy stored in organic molecules this process is primarily carried out by autotrophs or selffeeders which include plants algae and certain prokaryotes autotrophs use carbon dioxide and inorganic materials from their environment to synthesize organic compounds forming the foundation of the biospheres food web specifically plants are classified as photoautotrophs harnessing light energy to produce food through photosynthesis in contrast heterotrophs or otherfeeders cannot produce their own food and depend on organic material generated by autotrophs this group includes animals and decomposers such as fungi and prokaryotes which feed on dead organic matter heterotrophs are intrinsically linked to autotrophs not only for sustenance but also for oxygen a byproduct of photosynthesis chloroplasts are the cellular sites of photosynthesis in plants primarily located in leaf mesophyll cells these organelles contain chlorophyll the pigment responsible for capturing light energy driving the synthesis of organic molecules essential for life the intricate structure of chloroplasts facilitates efficient photosynthesis linking energy transformation to the survival of life on earth
tracking atoms through photosynthesis scientific inquiry scientists have tried for centuries to piece together the process by which plants make food although some of the steps are still not completely understood the overall photosynthetic equation has been known since the 1800s in the presence of light the green parts of plants produce organic compounds and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water using molecular formulas we can summarize the complex series of chemical reactions in photosynthesis with this chemical equation 6 co2 12 h2o light energy s c6h12o6 6 o2 6 h2o we use glucose c6h12o6 here to simplify the relationship between photosynthesis and respiration but the direct product of photosynthesis is actually a threecarbon sugar that can be used to make glucose water appears on both sides of the equation because 12 molecules are consumed and 6 molecules are newly formed during photosynthesis we can simplify the equation by indicating only the net consumption of water 6 co2 6 h2o light energy s c6h12o6 6 o2 writing the equation in this form we can see that the overall chemical change during photosynthesis is the reverse of the one that occurs during cellular respiration see concept 91 both of these metabolic processes occur in plant cells however as you will soon learn chloroplasts do not synthesize sugars by simply reversing the steps of respiration now lets divide the photosynthetic equation by 6 to put it in its simplest possible form co2 h2o s ch2o o2 here the brackets indicate that ch2o is not an actual sugar but represents the general formula for a carbohydrate see concept 52 in other words we are imagining the synthesis of a sugar molecule one carbon at a time six repetitions would theoretically produce a glucose molecule c6h12o6 lets now see how researchers tracked the elements c h and o from the reactants of photosynthesis to the products the splitting of water one of the first clues to the mechanism of photosynthesis came from the discovery that the o2 given off by plants is derived from h2o and not from co2 the chloroplast splits water into hydrogen and oxygen before this discovery the prevailing hypothesis was that photosynthesis split carbon dioxide co2 s c o2 and then added water to the carbon c h2o s ch2o this hypothesis predicted that the o2 released during photosynthesis came from co2 this idea was challenged in the 1930s by c b van niel of stanford university van niel was investigating photosynthesis in bacteria that make their carbohydrate from co2 but do not release o2 he concluded that at least in these bacteria co2 is not split into carbon and oxygen one group of bacteria used hydrogen sulfide h2s rather than water for photosynthesis forming yellow globules of sulfur as a waste product these globules are visible in figure 102e here is the chemical equation for photosynthesis in these sulfur bacteria co2 2 h2s s ch2o h2o 2 s van niel reasoned that the bacteria split h2s and used the hydrogen atoms to make sugar he then generalized that idea proposing that all photosynthetic organisms require a hydrogen source but that the source varies sulfur bacteria co2 2 h2s s ch2o h2o 2 s plants co2 2 h2o s ch2o h2o o2 general co2 2 h2x s ch2o h2o 2 x thus van niel hypothesized that plants split h2o as a source of electrons from hydrogen atoms releasing o2 as a byproduct nearly 20 years later scientists confirmed van niels hypothesis by using oxygen18 18o a heavy isotope as a tracer to follow the fate of oxygen atoms during photosynthesis the experiments showed that the o2 from plants was labeled with 18o only if water was the source of the tracer experiment 1 if the 18o was introduced to the plant in the form of co2 the label did not turn up in the released o2 experiment 2 in the following summary red denotes labeled atoms of oxygen 18o experiment 1 co2 2 h2o s ch2o h2o o2 experiment 2 co2 2 h2o s ch2o h2o o2 a significant result of the shuffling of atoms during photosynthesis is the extraction of hydrogen from water and its incorporation into sugar the waste product of photosynthesis o2 is released to the atmosphere figure 105 shows the fates of all atoms in photosynthesis photosynthesis as a redox process lets briefly compare photosynthesis with cellular respiration both processes involve redox reactions during cellular respiration energy is released from sugar when electrons associated with hydrogen are transported by carriers to oxygen forming water as a byproduct the electrons lose potential energy as they fall down the electron transport chain toward electronegative oxygen and the mitochondrion harnesses that energy to synthesize atp see figure 915 photosynthesis reverses the direction of electron flow water is split and electrons are transferred along with hydrogen ions from the water to carbon dioxide reducing it to sugar becomes reduced becomes oxidized energy 6 co2 6 h2o c6h12o6 6 o2 because the electrons increase in potential energy as they move from water to sugar this process requires energyin other words is endergonic this energy boost that occurs during photosynthesis is provided by light,scientists have long sought to understand the intricate process by which plants produce food through photosynthesis essentially photosynthesis transforms carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen highlighting the importance of water as the source of oxygen released during the process initial hypotheses suggested that oxygen came from carbon dioxide but studies by c b van niel revealed that plants split water molecules to obtain hydrogen and release oxygen as a byproduct this hypothesis was validated through experiments using the oxygen18 isotope showing that oxygen released during photosynthesis derived solely from water not carbon dioxide photosynthesis is also characterized as a redox process where water is oxidized to release oxygen while carbon dioxide is reduced to form glucose this energyintensive process is endergonic relying on light energy to drive the transformation of inorganic molecules into organic compounds
the light reactions convert solar energy to the chemical energy of atp and nadph chloroplasts are chemical factories powered by the sun their thylakoids transform light energy into the chemical energy of atp and nadph which will be used to synthesize glucose and other molecules that can be used as energy sources to better understand the conversion of light to chemical energy we need to know about some important properties of light the nature of sunlight light is a form of energy known as electromagnetic energy also called electromagnetic radiation electromagnetic energy travels in rhythmic waves analogous to those created by dropping a pebble into a pond electromagnetic waves however are disturbances of electric and magnetic fields rather than disturbances of a material medium such as water the distance between the crests of electromagnetic waves is called the wavelength wavelengths range from less than a nanometer for gamma rays to more than a kilometer for radio waves this entire range of radiation is known as the electromagnetic spectrum figure 107 the segment most important to life is the narrow band from about 380 nm to 750 nm in wavelength this radiation is known as visible light because it can be detected as various colors by the human eye the model of light as waves explains many of lights properties but in certain respects light behaves as though it consists of discrete particles called photons photons are not tangible objects but they act like objects in that each of them has a fixed quantity of energy the amount of energy is inversely related to the wavelength of the light the shorter the wavelength the greater the energy of each photon of that light thus a photon of violet light packs nearly twice as much energy as a photon of red light see figure 107 although the sun radiates the full spectrum of electromagnetic energy the atmosphere acts like a selective window allowing visible light to pass through while screening out a substantial fraction of other radiation the part of the spectrum we can seevisible lightis also the radiation that drives photosynthesis photosynthetic pigments the light receptors when light meets matter it may be reflected transmitted or absorbed substances that absorb visible light are known as pigments different pigments absorb light of different wavelengths and the wavelengths that are absorbed disappear if a pigment is illuminated with white light the color we see is the color most reflected or transmitted by the pigment if a pigment absorbs all wavelengths it appears black we see green when we look at a leaf because chlorophyll absorbs violetblue and red light while transmitting and reflecting green light figure 108 the ability of a pigment to absorb various wavelengths of light can be measured with an instrument called a spectrophotometer this machine directs beams of light of different wavelengths through a solution of the pigment and measures the fraction of the light transmitted at each wavelength a graph plotting a pigments light absorption versus wavelength is called an absorption spectrum figure 109 the absorption spectra of chloroplast pigments provide clues to the relative effectiveness of different wavelengths for driving photosynthesis since light can perform work in chloroplasts only if it is absorbed figure 1010a shows the absorption spectra of three types of pigments in chloroplasts chlorophyll a the key lightcapturing pigment that participates directly in the light reactions the accessory pigment chlorophyll b and a separate group of accessory pigments called carotenoids the spectrum of chlorophyll a suggests that violetblue and red light work best for photosynthesis since they are absorbed while green is the least effective color this is confirmed by an action spectrum for photosynthesis figure 1010b which profiles the relative effectiveness of different wavelengths of radiation in driving the process an action spectrum is prepared by illuminating chloroplasts with light of different colors and then plotting wavelength against some measure of photosynthetic rate such as co2 consumption or o2 release the action spectrum for photosynthesis was first demonstrated by theodor w engelmann a german botanist in 1883 before equipment for measuring o2 levels had even been invented engelmann performed a clever experiment in which he used bacteria to measure rates of photosynthesis in filamentous algae figure 1010c his results are a striking match to the modern action spectrum shown in figure 1010b notice by comparing figures 1010a and 1010b that the action spectrum for photosynthesis is much broader than the absorption spectrum of chlorophyll a the absorption spectrum of chlorophyll a alone underestimates the effectiveness of certain wavelengths in driving photosynthesis this is partly because accessory pigments with different absorption spectra also present in chloroplastsincluding chlorophyll b and carotenoidsbroaden the spectrum of colors that can be used for photosynthesis figure 1011 shows the structure of chlorophyll a compared with that of chlorophyll b a slight structural difference between them is enough to cause the two pigments to absorb at slightly different wavelengths in the red and blue parts of the spectrum see figure 1010a as a result chlorophyll a appears blue green and chlorophyll b olive green under visible light other accessory pigments include carotenoids hydrocarbons that are various shades of yellow and orange because they absorb violet and bluegreen light see figure 1010a carotenoids may broaden the spectrum of colors that can drive photosynthesis however a more important function of at least some carotenoids seems to be photoprotection these compounds absorb and dissipate excessive light energy that would otherwise damage chlorophyll or interact with oxygen forming reactive oxidative molecules that are dangerous to the cell interestingly carotenoids similar to the photoprotective ones in chloroplasts have a photoprotective role in the human eye remember being told to eat your carrots for improved night vision these and related molecules are of course found naturally in many vegetables and fruits they are also often advertised in health food products as phytochemicals from the greek phyton plant some of which have antioxidant properties plants can synthesize all the antioxidants they require but humans and other animals must obtain some of them from their diets determining an absorption spectrum application an absorption spectrum is a visual representation of how well a particular pigment absorbs different wavelengths of visible light absorption spectra of various chloroplast pigments help scientists decipher the role of each pigment in a plant technique a spectrophotometer measures the relative amounts of light of different wavelengths absorbed and transmitted by a pigment solution 1 white light is separated into colors wavelengths by a prism 2 one by one the different colors of light are passed through the sample chlorophyll in this example green light and blue light are shown here 3 the transmitted light strikes a photoelectric tube which converts the light energy to electricity 4 the electric current is measured by a galvanometer the meter indicates the fraction of light transmitted through the sample from which we can determine the amount of light absorbed which wavelengths of light are most effective in driving photosynthesis a absorption spectra the three curves show the wavelengths of light best absorbed by three types of chloroplast pigments b action spectrum this graph plots the rate of photosynthesis versus wavelength the resulting action spectrum resembles the absorption spectrum for chlorophyll a but does not match exactly see part a this is partly due to the absorption of light by accessory pigments such as chlorophyll b and carotenoids c engelmanns experiment in 1883 theodor w engelmann illuminated a filamentous alga with light that had been passed through a prism exposing different segments of the alga to different wavelengths he used aerobic bacteria which concentrate near an oxygen source to determine which segments of the alga were releasing the most o2 and thus photosynthesizing most bacteria congregated in greatest numbers around the parts of the alga illuminated with violetblue or red light,photosynthesis is a vital process in plants involving lightdependent reactions that convert solar energy into chemical energy stored in atp and nadph within chloroplasts nature of sunlight light is a form of electromagnetic energy that travels in waves with visible light crucial for photosynthesis ranging from approximately 380 nm to 750 nm in wavelength photosynthetic pigments these pigments primarily chlorophyll a absorb specific wavelengths of light chlorophyll a absorbs violetblue and red light while reflecting green giving leaves their characteristic color accessory pigments like chlorophyll b and carotenoids broaden the spectrum of light absorbed and play a significant role in photoprotection dissipating excess light energy to prevent damage to chlorophyll absorption and action spectra the absorption spectrum of chlorophyll shows which wavelengths are absorbed most effectively while the action spectrum illustrates the effectiveness of these wavelengths in driving photosynthesis theodor w engelmanns experiments demonstrated that violetblue and red light are the most effective for photosynthesis as indicated by the concentration of aerobic bacteria around those wavelengths this understanding of light properties and pigments is crucial for comprehending how plants harness solar energy to produce food underscoring the significance of photosynthesis in ecosystems
excitation of chlorophyll by light what exactly happens when chlorophyll and other pigments absorb light the colors corresponding to the absorbed wavelengths disappear from the spectrum of the transmitted and reflected light but energy cannot disappear when a molecule absorbs a photon of light one of the molecules electrons is elevated to an orbital where it has more potential energy see figure 26b when the electron is in its normal orbital the pigment molecule is said to be in its ground state absorption of a photon boosts an electron to an orbital of higher energy and the pigment molecule is then said to be in an excited state the only photons absorbed are those whose energy is exactly equal to the energy difference between the ground state and an excited state and this energy difference varies from one kind of molecule to another thus a particular compound absorbs only photons corresponding to specific wavelengths which is why each pigment has a unique absorption spectrum once absorption of a photon raises an electron to an excited state the electron cannot stay there long the excited state like all highenergy states is unstable generally when isolated pigment molecules absorb light their excited electrons drop back down to the groundstate orbital in a billionth of a second releasing their excess energy as heat this conversion of light energy to heat is what makes the top of an automobile so hot on a sunny day white cars are coolest because their paint reflects all wavelengths of visible light in isolation some pigments including chlorophyll emit light as well as heat after absorbing photons as excited electrons fall back to the ground state photons are given off an afterglow called fluorescence an illuminated solution of chlorophyll isolated from chloroplasts will fluoresce in the red part of the spectrum and also give off heat figure 1012 this is best seen by illuminating with ultraviolet light which chlorophyll can also absorb see figures 107 and 1010a viewed under visible light the fluorescence would be harder to see against the green of the solution a photosystem a reactioncenter complex associated with lightharvesting complexes chlorophyll molecules excited by the absorption of light energy produce very different results in an intact chloroplast than they do in isolation see figure 1012 in their native environment of the thylakoid membrane chlorophyll molecules are organized along with other small organic molecules and proteins into complexes called photosystems a photosystem is composed of a reactioncenter complex surrounded by several lightharvesting complexes figure 1013 the reactioncenter complex is an organized association of proteins holding a special pair of chlorophyll a molecules each lightharvesting complex consists of various pigment molecules which may include chlorophyll a chlorophyll b and multiple carotenoids bound to proteins the number and variety of pigment molecules enable a photosystem to harvest light over a larger surface area and a larger portion of the spectrum than could any single pigment molecule alone together these lightharvesting complexes act as an antenna for the reactioncenter complex when a pigment molecule absorbs a photon the energy is transferred from pigment molecule to pigment molecule within a lightharvesting complex somewhat like a human wave at a sports arena until it is passed into the reactioncenter complex the reactioncenter complex also contains a molecule capable of accepting electrons and becoming reduced this is called the primary electron acceptor the pair of chlorophyll a molecules in the reactioncenter complex are special because their molecular environmenttheir location and the other molecules with which they are associatedenables them to use the energy from light not only to boost one of their electrons to a higher energy level but also to transfer it to a different moleculethe primary electron acceptor the solarpowered transfer of an electron from the reactioncenter chlorophyll a pair to the primary electron acceptor is the first step of the light reactions as soon as the chlorophyll electron is excited to a higher energy level the primary electron acceptor captures it this is a redox reaction in the flask shown in figure 1012b isolated chlorophyll fluoresces because there is no electron acceptor so electrons of photoexcited chlorophyll drop right back to the ground state in the structured environment of a chloroplast however an electron acceptor is readily available and the potential energy represented by the excited electron is not dissipated as light and heat thus each photosystem a reactioncenter complex surrounded by lightharvesting complexesfunctions in the chloroplast as a unit it converts light energy to chemical energy which will ultimately be used for the synthesis of sugar the thylakoid membrane is populated by two types of photosystems that cooperate in the light reactions of photosynthesis they are called photosystem ii ps ii and photosystem i ps i they were named in order of their discovery but photosystem ii functions first in the light reactions each has a characteristic reactioncenter complexa particular kind of primary electron acceptor next to a special pair of chlorophyll a molecules associated with specific proteins the reactioncenter chlorophyll a of photosystem ii is known as p680 because this pigment is best at absorbing light having a wavelength of 680 nm in the red part of the spectrum the chlorophyll a at the reactioncenter complex of photosystem i is called p700 because it most effectively absorbs light of wavelength 700 nm in the farred part of the spectrum these two pigments p680 and p700 are nearly identical chlorophyll a molecules however their association with different proteins in the thylakoid membrane affects the electron distribution in the two pigments and accounts for the slight differences in their lightabsorbing properties now lets see how the two photosystems work together in using light energy to generate atp and nadph the two main products of the light reactions the structure and function of a photosystem a how a photosystem harvests light when a photon strikes a pigment molecule in a lightharvesting complex the energy is passed from molecule to molecule until it reaches the reactioncenter complex here an excited electron from the special pair of chlorophyll a molecules is transferred to the primary electron acceptor b structure of a photosystem this computer model based on xray crystallography shows two photosystem complexes side by side oriented opposite to each other chlorophyll molecules small green ballandstick models are interspersed with protein subunits cylinders and ribbons for simplicity this photosystem will be shown as a single complex in the rest of the chapter,when chlorophyll and other pigments absorb light their electrons are excited to a higher energy level entering an excited state this is a temporary condition and in isolated pigments the excited electrons quickly return to the ground state releasing energy as heat or light in a process called fluorescence however in chloroplasts chlorophyll molecules are arranged in highly organized structures known as photosystems these photosystems are made up of a reactioncenter complex surrounded by multiple lightharvesting complexes the lightharvesting complexes capture light energy and transfer it to the reaction center where chlorophyll a molecules are located these special chlorophyll molecules use the energy to excite electrons which are transferred to a nearby molecule called the primary electron acceptor in a redox reaction this is the first step in converting light energy into chemical energy there are two types of photosystems photosystem ii ps ii which absorbs light best at 680 nm and photosystem i ps i which absorbs light at 700 nm together they produce atp and nadph the energy carriers used in the synthesis of sugars during photosynthesis
linear electron flow light drives the synthesis of atp and nadph by energizing the two photosystems embedded in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts the key to this energy transformation is a flow of electrons through the photosystems and other molecular components built into the thylakoid membrane this is called linear electron flow and it occurs during the light reactions of photosynthesis as shown in figure 1014 the numbered steps in the text correspond to the numbered steps in the figure 1 a photon of light strikes one of the pigment molecules in a lightharvesting complex of ps ii boosting one of its electrons to a higher energy level as this electron falls back to its ground state an electron in a nearby pigment molecule is simultaneously raised to an excited state the process continues with the energy being relayed to other pigment molecules until it reaches the p680 pair of chlorophyll a molecules in the ps ii reactioncenter complex it excites an electron in this pair of chlorophylls to a higher energy state 2 this electron is transferred from the excited p680 to the primary electron acceptor we can refer to the resulting form of p680 missing an electron as p680 3 an enzyme catalyzes the splitting of a water molecule into two electrons two hydrogen ions h and an oxygen atom the electrons are supplied one by one to the p680 pair each electron replacing one transferred to the primary electron acceptor p680 is the strongest biological oxidizing agent known its electron hole must be filled this greatly facilitates the transfer of electrons from the split water molecule the h are released into the thylakoid space the oxygen atom immediately combines with an oxygen atom generated by the splitting of another water molecule forming o2 4 each photoexcited electron passes from the primary electron acceptor of ps ii to ps i via an electron transport chain the components of which are similar to those of the electron transport chain that functions in cellular respiration the electron transport chain between ps ii and ps i is made up of the electron carrier plastoquinone pq a cytochrome complex and a protein called plastocyanin pc 5 the exergonic fall of electrons to a lower energy level provides energy for the synthesis of atp as electrons pass through the cytochrome complex h are pumped into the thylakoid space contributing to the proton gradient that is subsequently used in chemiosmosis 6 meanwhile light energy has been transferred via lightharvesting complex pigments to the ps i reactioncenter complex exciting an electron of the p700 pair of chlorophyll a molecules located there the photoexcited electron is then transferred to ps is primary electron acceptor creating an electron hole in the p700which we now can call p700 in other words p700 can now act as an electron acceptor accepting an electron that reaches the bottom of the electron transport chain from ps ii 7 photoexcited electrons are passed in a series of redox reactions from the primary electron acceptor of ps i down a second electron transport chain through the protein ferredoxin fd this chain does not create a proton gradient and thus does not produce atp 8 the enzyme nadp reductase catalyzes the transfer of electrons from fd to nadp two electrons are required for its reduction to nadph this molecule is at a higher energy level than water so its electrons are more readily available for the reactions of the calvin cycle this process also removes an h from the stroma the energy changes of electrons during their linear flow through the light reactions are shown in a mechanical analogy in figure 1015 although the scheme shown in figures 1014 and 1015 may seem complicated do not lose track of the big picture the light reactions use solar power to generate atp and nadph which provide chemical energy and reducing power respectively to the carbohydratesynthesizing reactions of the calvin cycle cyclic electron flow in certain cases photoexcited electrons can take an alternative path called cyclic electron flow which uses photosystem i but not photosystem ii you can see in figure 1016 that cyclic flow is a short circuit the electrons cycle back from ferredoxin fd to the cytochrome complex and from there continue on to a p700 chlorophyll in the ps i reactioncenter complex there is no production of nadph and no release of oxygen that results from this process on the other hand cyclic flow does generate atp rather than having both psii and psi several of the currently existing groups of photosynthetic bacteria are known to have a single photosystem related to either psii or psi for these species which include the purple sulfur bacteria see figure 102e and the green sulfur bacteria cyclic electron flow is the one and only means of generating atp during the process of photosynthesis evolutionary biologists hypothesize that these bacterial groups are descendants of ancestral bacteria in which photosynthesis first evolved in a form similar to cyclic electron flow cyclic electron flow can also occur in photosynthetic species that possess both photosystems this includes some prokaryotes such as the cyanobacteria shown in figure 102d as well as the eukaryotic photosynthetic species that have been tested thus far although the process is probably in part an evolutionary leftover research suggests it plays at least one beneficial role for these organisms mutant plants that are not able to carry out cyclic electron flow are capable of growing well in low light but do not grow well where light is intense this is evidence for the idea that cyclic electron flow may be photoprotective later youll learn more about cyclic electron flow as it relates to a particular adaptation of photosynthesis c4 plants see concept 104 whether atp synthesis is driven by linear or cyclic electron flow the actual mechanism is the same before we move on to consider the calvin cycle lets review chemiosmosis the process that uses membranes to couple redox reactions to atp production,in photosynthesis linear electron flow powers atp and nadph production by energizing photosystem ii ps ii and photosystem i ps i light excites electrons in ps ii boosting them to the p680 chlorophyll where they are transferred to the primary electron acceptor the splitting of water replenishes these electrons releasing oxygen as a byproduct the excited electrons then move through an electron transport chain creating a proton gradient that drives atp synthesis in ps i light excites electrons in p700 chlorophyll which transfers them to its primary electron acceptor these electrons pass through a second electron transport chain and are used by the enzyme nadp reductase to reduce nadp to nadph both essential for the calvin cycle where sugars are synthesized cyclic electron flow is an alternative path where electrons cycle back to the cytochrome complex generating atp without producing nadph or oxygen this pathway is important for balancing atp production and providing photoprotection in conditions of intense light in certain bacteria cyclic electron flow is the only method of atp production during photosynthesis
a comparison of chemiosmosis in chloroplasts and mitochondria chloroplasts and mitochondria generate atp by the same basic mechanism chemiosmosis an electron transport chain pumps protons h across a membrane as electrons are passed through a series of carriers that are progressively more electronegative thus electron transport chains transform redox energy to a protonmotive force potential energy stored in the form of an h gradient across a membrane an atp synthase complex in the same membrane couples the diffusion of hydrogen ions down their gradient to the phosphorylation of adp forming atp some of the electron carriers including the ironcontaining proteins called cytochromes are very similar in chloroplasts and mitochondria the atp synthase complexes of the two organelles are also quite similar but there are noteworthy differences between photophosphorylation in chloroplasts and oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria in chloroplasts the highenergy electrons dropped down the transport chain come from water while in mitochondria they are extracted from organic molecules which are thus oxidized chloroplasts do not need molecules from food to make atp their photosystems capture light energy and use it to drive the electrons from water to the top of the transport chain in other words mitochondria use chemiosmosis to transfer chemical energy from food molecules to atp whereas chloroplasts transform light energy into chemical energy in atp although the spatial organization of chemiosmosis differs slightly between chloroplasts and mitochondria it is easy to see similarities in the two figure 1017 the inner membrane of the mitochondrion pumps protons from the mitochondrial matrix out to the intermembrane space which then serves as a reservoir of hydrogen ions the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast pumps protons from the stroma into the thylakoid space interior of the thylakoid which functions as the h reservoir if you imagine the cristae of mitochondria pinching off from the inner membrane this may help you see how the thylakoid space and the intermembrane space are comparable spaces in the two organelles while the mitochondrial matrix is analogous to the stroma of the chloroplast in the mitochondrion protons diffuse down their concentration gradient from the intermembrane space through atp synthase to the matrix driving atp synthesis in the chloroplast atp is synthesized as the hydrogen ions diffuse from the thylakoid space back to the stroma through atp synthase complexes whose catalytic knobs are on the stroma side of the membrane figure 1018 thus atp forms in the stroma where it is used to help drive sugar synthesis during the calvin cycle the proton h gradient or ph gradient across the thylakoid membrane is substantial when chloroplasts in an experimental setting are illuminated the ph in the thylakoid space drops to about 5 the h concentration increases and the ph in the stroma increases to about 8 the h concentration decreases this gradient of three ph units corresponds to a thousandfold difference in h concentration if the lights are then turned off the ph gradient is abolished but it can quickly be restored by turning the lights back on experiments such as this provided strong evidence in support of the chemiosmotic model the currentlyaccepted model for the organization of the lightreaction machinery within the thylakoid membrane is based on several research studies each of the molecules and molecular complexes in the figure is present in numerous copies in each thylakoid notice that nadph like atp is produced on the side of the membrane facing the stroma where the calvin cycle reactions take place lets summarize the light reactions electron flow pushes electrons from water where they are at a low state of potential energy ultimately to nadph where they are stored at a high state of potential energy the lightdriven electron flow also generates atp thus the equipment of the thylakoid membrane converts light energy to chemical energy stored in atp and nadph oxygen is a byproduct lets now see how the calvin cycle uses the products of the light reactions to synthesize sugar from co2 the light reactions and chemiosmosis current model of the organization of the thylakoid membrane the gold arrows track the linear electron flow outlined in figure 1014 at least three steps in the light reactions contribute to the h gradient by increasing h concentration in the thylakoid space 1 water is split by photosystem ii on the side of the membrane facing the thylakoid space 2 as plastoquinone pq transfers electrons to the cytochrome complex four protons are translocated across the membrane into the thylakoid space and 3 a hydrogen ion is removed from the stroma when it is taken up by nadp notice that in step 2 hydrogen ions are being pumped from the stroma into the thylakoid space as in figure 1017 the diffusion of h from the thylakoid space back to the stroma along the h concentration gradient powers the atp synthase these lightdriven reactions store chemical energy in nadph and atp which shuttle the energy to the carbohydrateproducing calvin cycle,chemiosmosis in both chloroplasts and mitochondria is a vital process for atp production though the energy sources and contexts differ in both organelles protons h are pumped across a membrane by an electron transport chain creating a proton gradient this gradient represents stored energy which drives atp synthesis when the protons flow back through atp synthase chloroplasts in photosynthesis light energy excites electrons which are derived from water in the thylakoid membrane these excited electrons flow through the electron transport chain pumping protons into the thylakoid space as the protons flow back into the stroma atp is generated alongside nadph both atp and nadph fuel the calvin cycle to produce sugars from co2 this process is called photophosphorylation mitochondria in cellular respiration electrons extracted from organic molecules like glucose move through the transport chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane pumping protons into the intermembrane space the flow of protons back into the mitochondrial matrix through atp synthase produces atp this process is known as oxidative phosphorylation thus while chloroplasts convert light energy to chemical energy mitochondria extract chemical energy from food
the calvin cycle uses the chemical energy of atp and nadph to reduce co2 to sugar the calvin cycle is similar to the citric acid cycle in that a starting material is regenerated after some molecules enter the cycle and others exit the cycle however the citric acid cycle is catabolic oxidizing acetyl coa and using the energy to synthesize atp in contrast the calvin cycle is anabolic building carbohydrates from smaller molecules and consuming energy carbon enters the calvin cycle in the form of co2 and leaves in the form of sugar the cycle spends atp as an energy source and consumes nadph as reducing power for adding highenergy electrons to make the sugar as we mentioned previously in concept 101 the carbohydrate produced directly from the calvin cycle is actually not glucose but a threecarbon sugar the name of this sugar is glyceraldehyde 3phosphate g3p for the net synthesis of one molecule of g3p the cycle must take place three times fixing three molecules of co2one per turn of the cycle recall that the term carbon fixation refers to the initial incorporation of co2 into organic material as we trace the steps of the cycle its important to keep in mind that we are following three molecules of co2 through the reactions figure 1019 divides the calvin cycle into three phases carbon fixation reduction and regeneration of the co2 acceptor phase 1 carbon fixation the calvin cycle incorporates each co2 molecule one at a time by attaching it to a fivecarbon sugar named ribulose bisphosphate abbreviated rubp the enzyme that catalyzes this first step is rubp carboxylaseoxygenase or rubisco this is the most abundant protein in chloroplasts and is also thought to be the most abundant protein on earth the product of the reaction is a sixcarbon intermediate that is shortlived because it is so energetically unstable that it immediately splits in half forming two molecules of 3phosphoglycerate for each co2 fixed phase 2 reduction each molecule of 3phosphoglycerate receives an additional phosphate group from atp becoming 13bisphosphoglycerate next a pair of electrons donated from nadph reduces 13bisphosphoglycerate which also loses a phosphate group in the process becoming glyceraldehyde 3phosphate g3p specifically the electrons from nadph reduce a carboyxl group on 13bisphosphoglycerate to the aldehyde group of g3p which stores more potential energy g3p is a sugarthe same threecarbon sugar formed in glycolysis by the splitting of glucose see figure 99 notice in figure 1019 that for every three molecules of co2 that enter the cycle there are six molecules of g3p formed but only one molecule of this threecarbon sugar can be counted as a net gain of carbohydrate because the rest are required to complete the cycle the cycle began with 15 carbons worth of carbohydrate in the form of three molecules of the fivecarbon sugar rubp now there are 18 carbons worth of carbohydrate in the form of six molecules of g3p one molecule exits the cycle to be used by the plant cell but the other five molecules must be recycled to regenerate the three molecules of rubp phase 3 regeneration of the co2 acceptor rubp in a complex series of reactions the carbon skeletons of five molecules of g3p are rearranged by the last steps of the calvin cycle into three molecules of rubp to accomplish this the cycle spends three more molecules of atp the rubp is now prepared to receive co2 again and the cycle continues for the net synthesis of one g3p molecule the calvin cycle consumes a total of nine molecules of atp and six molecules of nadph the light reactions regenerate the atp and nadph the g3p spun off from the calvin cycle becomes the starting material for metabolic pathways that synthesize other organic compounds including glucose formed by combining two molecules of g3p the disaccharide sucrose and other carbohydrates neither the light reactions nor the calvin cycle alone can make sugar from co2 photosynthesis is an emergent property of the intact chloroplast which integrates the two stages of photosynthesis,the calvin cycle is a crucial part of photosynthesis responsible for converting carbon dioxide co2 into sugars using the energy provided by atp and nadph which are produced in the lightdependent reactions unlike the citric acid cycle which breaks down molecules to release energy the calvin cycle is anabolic building complex carbohydrates while consuming energy the cycle consists of three phases carbon fixation each co2 molecule is attached to a fivecarbon sugar ribulose bisphosphate rubp in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme rubisco this forms an unstable sixcarbon compound that quickly splits into two molecules of 3phosphoglycerate reduction the 3phosphoglycerate molecules are modified using atp and reduced by nadph to form glyceraldehyde 3phosphate g3p a threecarbon sugar only one molecule of g3p is released to be used by the plant while the rest are recycled regeneration the remaining g3p molecules are used to regenerate rubp with the help of additional atp allowing the cycle to continue to produce one molecule of g3p the calvin cycle consumes nine atp and six nadph g3p is then used to form glucose and other organic compounds
alternative mechanisms of carbon fixation have evolved in hot arid climates ever since plants first moved onto land about 475 million years ago they have been adapting to the problems of terrestrial life particularly the problem of dehydration in chapters 29 and 36 we will consider anatomical adaptations that help plants conserve water while in this chapter we are concerned with metabolic adaptations the solutions often involve tradeoffs an important example is the compromise between photosynthesis and the prevention of excessive water loss from the plant the co2 required for photosynthesis enters a leaf and the resulting o2 exits via stomata the pores on the leaf surface see figure 104 however stomata are also the main avenues of transpiration the evaporative loss of water from leaves on a hot dry day most plants close their stomata a response that conserves water this response also reduces photosynthetic yield by limiting access to co2 with stomata even partially closed co2 concentrations begin to decrease in the air spaces within the leaf and the concentration of o2 released from the light reactions begins to increase these conditions within the leaf favor an apparently wasteful process called photorespiration photorespiration an evolutionary relic in most plants initial fixation of carbon occurs via rubisco the calvin cycle enzyme that adds co2 to ribulose bisphosphate such plants are called c3 plants because the first organic product of carbon fixation is a threecarbon compound 3phosphoglycerate see figure 1019 rice wheat and soybeans are c3 plants that are important in agriculture when their stomata partially close on hot dry days c3 plants produce less sugar because the declining level of co2 in the leaf starves the calvin cycle in addition rubisco is capable of binding o2 in place of co2 as co2 becomes scarce within the air spaces of the leaf and o2 builds up rubisco adds o2 to the calvin cycle instead of co2 the product splits and a twocarbon compound leaves the chloroplast peroxisomes and mitochondria within the plant cell rearrange and split this compound releasing co2 the process is called photorespiration because it occurs in the light photo and consumes o2 while producing co2 respiration however unlike normal cellular respiration photorespiration uses atp rather than generating it and unlike photosynthesis photorespiration produces no sugar in fact photorespiration decreases photosynthetic output by siphoning organic material from the calvin cycle and releasing co2 that would otherwise be fixed this co2 can eventually be fixed if it is still in the leaf once the co2 concentration is high enough in the meantime though the process is energetically costly much like a hamster running on its wheel how can we explain the existence of a metabolic process that seems to be counterproductive for the plant according to one hypothesis photorespiration is evolutionary baggagea metabolic relic from a much earlier time when the atmosphere had less o2 and more co2 than it does today in the ancient atmosphere that prevailed when rubisco first evolved the inability of the enzymes active site to exclude o2 would have made little difference the hypothesis suggests that modern rubisco retains some of its chance affinity for o2 which is now so concentrated in the atmosphere that a certain amount of photorespiration is inevitable we now know that at least in some cases photorespiration plays a protective role in plants plants that are impaired in their ability to carry out photorespiration due to defective genes are more susceptible to damage induced by excess light researchers consider this clear evidence that photorespiration acts to neutralize the otherwise damaging products of the light reactions which build up when a low co2 concentration limits the progress of the calvin cycle whether there are other benefits of photorespiration is still unknown in many types of plantsincluding a significant number of crop plantsphotorespiration drains away as much as 50 of the carbon fixed by the calvin cycle as heterotrophs that depend on carbon fixation in chloroplasts for our food we naturally view photorespiration as wasteful indeed if photorespiration could be reduced in certain plant species without otherwise affecting photosynthetic productivity crop yields and food supplies might increase in some plant species alternate modes of carbon fixation have evolved that minimize photorespiration and optimize the calvin cycleeven in hot arid climates the two most important of these photosynthetic adaptations are c4 photosynthesis and crassulacean acid metabolism cam c4 plants the c4 plants are so named because they preface the calvin cycle with an alternate mode of carbon fixation that forms a fourcarbon compound as its first product the c4 pathway is believed to have evolved independently at least 45 separate times and is used by several thousand species in at least 19 plant families among the c4 plants important to agriculture are sugarcane and corn members of the grass family the anatomy of a c4 leaf is correlated with the mechanism of c4 photosynthesis in c4 plants there are two distinct types of photosynthetic cells bundlesheath cells and mesophyll cells bundlesheath cells are arranged into tightly packed sheaths around the veins of the leaf figure 1020 between the bundle sheath and the leaf surface are the more loosely arranged mesophyll cells which in c4 leaves are closely associated and never more than two to three cells away from the bundlesheath cells the calvin cycle is confined to the chloroplasts of the bundlesheath cells however the calvin cycle is preceded by incorporation of co2 into organic compounds in the mesophyll cells see the numbered steps in figure 1020 which are also described here 1 the first step is carried out by an enzyme present only in mesophyll cells called pep carboxylase this enzyme adds co2 to phosphoenolpyruvate pep forming the fourcarbon product oxaloacetate pep carboxylase has a much higher affinity for co2 than does rubisco and no affinity for o2 therefore pep carboxylase can fix carbon efficiently when rubisco cannotthat is when it is hot and dry and stomata are partially closed causing co2 concentration in the leaf to be lower and o2 concentration to be relatively higher 2 after the c4 plant fixes carbon from co2 the mesophyll cells export their fourcarbon products malate in the example shown in figure 1020 to bundlesheath cells through plasmodesmata see figure 629 3 within the bundlesheath cells the fourcarbon compounds release co2 which is reassimilated into organic material by rubisco and the calvin cycle the same reaction regenerates pyruvate which is transported to mesophyll cells there atp is used to convert pyruvate to pep allowing the reaction cycle to continue this atp can be thought of in a sense as the price of concentrating co2 in the bundlesheath cells to generate this extra atp bundlesheath cells carry out cyclic electron flow the process described earlier in this chapter see figure 1016 in fact these cells contain ps i but no ps ii so cyclic electron flow is their only photosynthetic mode of generating atp in effect the mesophyll cells of a c4 plant pump co2 into the bundle sheath keeping the co2 concentration in the bundlesheath cells high enough for rubisco to bind co2 rather than o2 the cyclic series of reactions involving pep carboxylase and the regeneration of pep can be thought of as a co2concentrating pump that is powered by atp in this way c4 photosynthesis spends atp energy to minimize photorespiration and enhance sugar production this adaptation is especially advantageous in hot regions with intense sunlight where stomata partially close during the day and it is in such environments that c4 plants evolved and thrive today the concentration of co2 in the atmosphere has drastically increased since the industrial revolution began in the 1800s and it continues to rise today due to human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels the resulting global climate change including an increase in average temperatures around the planet may have farreaching effects on plant species scientists are concerned that increasing co2 concentration and temperature may affect c3 and c4 plants differently thus changing the relative abundance of these species in a given plant community which type of plant would stand to gain more from increasing co2 levels recall that in c3 plants the binding of o2 rather than co2 by rubisco leads to photorespiration lowering the efficiency of photosynthesis c4 plants overcome this problem by concentrating co2 in the bundlesheath cells at the cost of atp rising co2 levels should benefit c3 plants by lowering the amount of photorespiration that occurs at the same time rising temperatures have the opposite effect increasing photorespiration other factors such as water availability may also come into play in contrast many c4 plants could be largely unaffected by increasing co2 levels or temperature researchers have investigated aspects of this question in several studies you can work with data from one such experiment in the scientific skills exercise in different regions the particular combination of co2 concentration and temperature is likely to alter the balance of c3 and c4 plants in varying ways the effects of such a widespread and variable change in community structure are unpredictable and thus a cause of legitimate concern,plants in hot arid climates have evolved alternative mechanisms for carbon fixation to cope with dehydration primarily through c3 and c4 photosynthesis c3 photosynthesis in this common method the enzyme rubisco fixes co2 into a threecarbon compound called 3phosphoglycerate 3pga however during hot dry conditions plants close their stomata to conserve water this reduces co2 intake and increases o2 levels leading to photorespiration a wasteful process where rubisco binds o2 instead of co2 which decreases sugar production and consumes energy atp without generating sugar c4 photosynthesis to minimize photorespiration c4 plants such as corn and sugarcane use a twocell system they first fix co2 into a fourcarbon compound using pep carboxylase an enzyme with a high affinity for co2 this process occurs in mesophyll cells while the calvin cycle takes place in bundlesheath cells allowing efficient sugar production even under stress as co2 levels rise due to human activities the distinct responses of c3 and c4 plants could reshape plant community structures and affect ecosystem dynamics
cam plants a second photosynthetic adaptation to arid conditions has evolved in many succulent waterstoring plants numerous cacti pineapples and representatives of several other plant families these plants open their stomata during the night and close them during the day just the reverse of how other plants behave closing stomata during the day helps desert plants conserve water but it also prevents co2 from entering the leaves during the night when their stomata are open these plants take up co2 and incorporate it into a variety of organic acids this mode of carbon fixation is called crassulacean acid metabolism or cam after the plant family crassulaceae the succulents in which the process was first discovered the mesophyll cells of cam plants store the organic acids they make during the night in their vacuoles until morning when the stomata close during the day when the light reactions can supply atp and nadph for the calvin cycle co2 is released from the organic acids made the night before to become incorporated into sugar in the chloroplasts notice in figure 1021 that the cam pathway is similar to the c4 pathway in that carbon dioxide is first incorporated into organic intermediates before it enters the calvin cycle the difference is that in c4 plants the initial steps of carbon fixation are separated structurally from the calvin cycle whereas in cam plants the two steps occur at separate times but within the same cell keep in mind that cam c4 and c3 plants all eventually use the calvin cycle to make sugar from carbon dioxide the importance of photosynthesis a review in this chapter we have followed photosynthesis from photons to food the light reactions capture solar energy and use it to make atp and transfer electrons from water to nadp forming nadph the calvin cycle uses the atp and nadph to produce sugar from carbon dioxide the energy that enters the chloroplasts as sunlight becomes stored as chemical energy in organic compounds the entire process is reviewed visually in figure 1022 where photosynthesis is also put in its natural context as for the fates of photosynthetic products enzymes in the chloroplast and cytosol convert the g3p made in the calvin cycle to many other organic compounds in fact the sugar made in the chloroplasts supplies the entire plant with chemical energy and carbon skeletons for the synthesis of all the major organic molecules of plant cells about 50 of the organic material made by photosynthesis is consumed as fuel for cellular respiration in plant cell mitochondria technically green cells are the only autotrophic parts of the plant the rest of the plant depends on organic molecules exported from leaves via veins see figure 1022 top in most plants carbohydrate is transported out of the leaves to the rest of the plant in the form of sucrose a disaccharide after arriving at nonphotosynthetic cells the sucrose provides raw material for cellular respiration and a multitude of anabolic pathways that synthesize proteins lipids and other products a considerable amount of sugar in the form of glucose is linked together to make the polysaccharide cellulose see figure 56c especially in plant cells that are still growing and maturing cellulose the main ingredient of cell walls is the most abundant organic molecule in the plant and probably on the surface of the planet most plants and other photosynthesizers make more organic material each day than they need to use as respiratory fuel and precursors for biosynthesis they stockpile the extra sugar by synthesizing starch storing some in the chloroplasts themselves and some in storage cells of roots tubers seeds and fruits in accounting for the consumption of the food molecules produced by photosynthesis lets not forget that most plants lose leaves roots stems fruits and sometimes their entire bodies to heterotrophs including humans on a global scale photosynthesis is the process responsible for the presence of oxygen in our atmosphere furthermore while each chloroplast is minuscule their collective productivity in terms of food production is prodigious photosynthesis makes an estimated 150 billion metric tons of carbohydrate per year a metric ton is 1000 kg about 11 tons thats organic matter equivalent in mass to a stack of about 60 trillion biology textbooks17 stacks of books reaching from earth to the sun no chemical process is more important than photosynthesis to the welfare of life on earth in chapters 5 through 10 you have learned about many activities of cells figure 1023 integrates these processes in the context of a working plant cell as you study the figure reflect on how each process fits into the big picture as the most basic unit of living organisms a cell performs all functions characteristic of life c4 and cam photosynthesis compared both adaptations are characterized by 1 preliminary incorporation of co2 into organic acids followed by 2 transfer of co2 to the calvin cycle the c4 and cam pathways are two evolutionary solutions to the problem of maintaining photosynthesis with stomata partially or completely closed on hot dry days a spatial separation of steps in c4 plants carbon fixation and the calvin cycle occur in different types of cells b temporal separation of steps in cam plants carbon fixation and the calvin cycle occur in the same cell at different times,crassulacean acid metabolism cam is a photosynthetic adaptation found in many succulent plants such as cacti and pineapples that thrive in hot arid climates these plants open their stomata at night to take in carbon dioxide co2 while minimizing water loss the absorbed co2 is converted into organic acids which are stored in vacuoles during the day when the stomata close co2 is released from these acids to enter the calvin cycle where it is converted into sugars using atp and nadph produced in the light reactions in addition c4 plants also demonstrate an alternative method of carbon fixation in c4 photosynthesis co2 is initially fixed in mesophyll cells and then transferred to bundlesheath cells where the calvin cycle occurs this spatial separation allows c4 plants to reduce photorespiration and enhance sugar production especially in high temperatures and low moisture conditions together cam and c4 adaptations showcase how plants have evolved to optimize photosynthesis and conserve water in challenging environments overall photosynthesis is vital for life on earth producing oxygen and organic compounds that support both autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms
cellular messaging the impala is breathing rapidly its heart pounding figure 111 flees for its life racing to escape the predatory cheetah nipping at his heels the impala is breathing rapidly its heart pounding and its legs pumping furiously these physiological functions are all part of the impalas fightorflight response driven by hormones released from its adrenal glands at times of stressin this case upon sensing the cheetah what systems of celltocell communication allow the trillions of cells in the impala to talk to each other coordinating their activities cells can signal to each other and interpret the signals they receive from other cells and the environment the signals may include light and touch but are most often chemicals the flight response shown here is triggered by a signaling molecule called epinephrine also called adrenaline see the model to the left studying cell communication biologists have discovered ample evidence for the evolutionary relatedness of all life the same small set of cellsignaling mechanisms shows up again and again in diverse species in processes ranging from bacterial signaling to embryonic development to cancer in this chapter we focus on the main mechanisms by which cells receive process and respond to chemical signals sent from other cells we will also consider apoptosis a type of programmed cell death that integrates input from multiple signaling pathways external signals are converted to responses within the cell what does a talking cell say to a listening cell and how does the latter cell respond to the message lets approach these questions by first looking at communication among microorganisms evolution of cell signaling one topic of cell conversation is sex cells of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiaewhich are used to make bread wine and beeridentify their mates by chemical signaling there are two sexes or mating types called a and figure 112 each type secretes a specific factor that binds to receptors only on the other type of cell when exposed to each others mating factors a pair of cells of opposite type change shape grow toward each other and fuse mate the new a cell contains all the genes of both original cells a combination of genetic resources that provides advantages to the cells descendants which arise by subsequent cell divisions once received by the yeast cell surface receptor a mating signal is changed or transduced into a form that brings about the cellular response of mating this occurs in a series of steps called a signal transduction pathway many such pathways exist in both yeast and animal cells in fact the molecular details of signal transduction in yeasts and mammals are strikingly similar even though their last common ancestor lived over a billion years ago this suggests that early versions of cellsignaling mechanisms evolved well before the first multicellular creatures appeared on earth scientists think that signaling mechanisms first evolved in ancient prokaryotes and singlecelled eukaryotes and then were adopted for new uses by their multicellular descendants cell signaling is critical in the microbial world figure 113 bacterial cells secrete molecules that can be detected by other bacterial cells sensing the concentration of such signaling molecules allows bacteria to monitor the local density of cells a phenomenon called quorum sensing quorum sensing allows bacterial populations to coordinate their behaviors in activities that require a given number of cells acting synchronously one example is formation of a biofilm an aggregation of bacterial cells adhered to a surface the cells in the biofilm generally derive nutrition from the surface they are on you have probably encountered biofilms many times perhaps without realizing it the slimy coating on a fallen log or on leaves lying on a forest path and even the film on your teeth each morning are examples of bacterial biofilms in fact toothbrushing disrupts biofilms that would otherwise cause cavities the formation of biofilms requires a sophisticated communication system the basis of which is cell signaling communication between mating yeast cells saccharomyces cerevisiae cells use chemical signaling to identify cells of opposite mating type and initiate the mating process the two mating types and their corresponding chemical signaling molecules or mating factors are called a and a 1 exchange of mating factors each cell type secretes a mating factor that binds to receptors on the other cell type 2mating binding of the factors to receptors induces changes in the cells that lead to their fusion 3 new a cell the nucleus of the fused cell includes all the genes from the a and cells,cellular messaging is crucial for coordinating physiological responses in organisms such as the fightorflight response in an impala facing a predator this response is primarily driven by hormones like epinephrine adrenaline which trigger signaling pathways that allow cells to communicate effectively cell signaling mechanisms have evolved over time and are conserved across diverse species highlighting evolutionary relationships for instance in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae chemical signaling allows cells to identify mating partners each mating type a and secretes specific factors that bind to receptors on the opposite type this interaction causes both cells to change shape and fuse forming a new a cell containing genetic material from both original cells which enhances genetic diversity in addition bacteria utilize a process called quorum sensing to monitor population density through signaling molecules this mechanism enables coordinated behaviors such as the formation of biofilms which are clusters of bacterial cells that adhere to surfaces and are crucial for various ecological interactions overall cell signaling plays a vital role in cellular communication development and responses to environmental stimuli
local and longdistance signaling like bacteria or yeast cells cells in a multicellular organism usually communicate via signaling molecules targeted for cells that may or may not be immediately adjacent as we saw in chapters 6 and 7 eukaryotic cells may communicate by direct contact one type of local signaling figure 114 both animals and plants have cell junctions that where present directly connect the cytoplasms of adjacent cells figure 114a in these cases signaling substances dissolved in the cytosol can pass freely between adjacent cells moreover animal cells may communicate via direct contact between membranebound cellsurface molecules in a process called cellcell recognition figure 114b this sort of local signaling is especially important in embryonic development and the immune response in many other cases of local signaling messenger molecules are secreted by the signaling cell some of these travel only short distances such local regulators influence cells in the vicinity one class of local regulators in animals growth factors are compounds that stimulate nearby target cells to grow and divide numerous cells can simultaneously receive and respond to the molecules of growth factor produced by a single cell in their vicinity this type of local signaling in animals is called paracrine signaling figure 115a another more specialized type of local signaling called synaptic signaling occurs in the animal nervous system figure 115b an electrical signal along a nerve cell triggers the secretion of neurotransmitter molecules these molecules act as chemical signals diffusing across the synapsethe narrow space between the nerve cell and its target celltriggering a response in the target cell beyond communication through plasmodesmata plant cell junctions local signaling in plants is not as well understood because of their cell walls plants use mechanisms different from those operating locally in animals both animals and plants use chemicals called hormones for longdistance signaling in hormonal signaling in animals also known as endocrine signaling specialized cells release hormone molecules which travel via the circulatory system to other parts of the body where they reach target cells that can recognize and respond to the hormones figure 115c plant hormones often called plant growth regulators sometimes travel in vessels but more often reach their targets by moving through cells or by diffusing through the air as a gas see concept 392 hormones vary widely in size and type as do local regulators for instance the plant hormone ethylene a gas that promotes fruit ripening and helps regulate growth is a hydrocarbon of only six atoms c2h4 small enough to pass through cell walls in contrast the mammalian hormone insulin which regulates sugar levels in the blood is a protein with thousands of atoms what happens when a cell encounters a secreted signaling molecule the ability of a cell to respond is determined by whether it has a specific receptor molecule that can bind to the signaling molecule the information conveyed by this binding the signal must then be changed into another formtransducedinside the cell before the cell can respond the remainder of the chapter discusses this process primarily as it occurs in animal cells communication by direct contact between cells a cell junctions both animals and plants have cell junctions that allow molecules to pass readily between adjacent cells without crossing plasma membranes b cellcell recognition two cells in an animal may communicate by interaction between molecules protruding from their surfaces the three stages of cell signaling a preview our current understanding of how chemical messengers act via signal transduction pathways had its origins in the pioneering work of earl w sutherland whose research led to a nobel prize in 1971 sutherland and his colleagues at vanderbilt university were investigating how the animal hormone epinephrine adrenaline stimulates the breakdown of the storage polysaccharide glycogen within liver cells and skeletal muscle cells glycogen breakdown releases the sugar glucose 1phosphate which the cell converts to glucose 6phosphate the liver or muscle cell can then use this compound an early intermediate in glycolysis for energy production alternatively the compound can be stripped of phosphate and released from the cell into the blood as glucose which can fuel cells throughout the body thus one effect of epinephrine is the mobilization of fuel reserves which can be used by the animal to either defend itself fight or escape whatever elicited a scare flight the impala in figure 111 is obviously engaged in the latter sutherlands research team discovered that epinephrine stimulates glycogen breakdown by somehow activating a cytosolic enzyme glycogen phosphorylase however when epinephrine was added to a testtube mixture containing the enzyme and its substrate glycogen no breakdown occurred glycogen phosphorylase could be activated by epinephrine only when the hormone was added to intact cells in a solution this result told sutherland two things first epinephrine does not interact directly with the enzyme responsible for glycogen breakdown an intermediate step or series of steps must be occurring inside the cell second the plasma membrane itself is necessary for transmission of the signal to take place sutherlands early work suggested that the process going on at the receiving end of a cellular conversation can be dissected into three stages reception transduction and response figure 116 1 reception reception is the target cells detection of a signaling molecule coming from outside the cell a chemical signal is detected when the signaling molecule binds to a receptor protein located at the cells surface or inside the cell to be discussed later 2 transduction the binding of the signaling molecule changes the receptor protein in some way initiating the process of transduction the transduction stage converts the signal to a form that can bring about a specific cellular response in sutherlands system the binding of epinephrine to a receptor protein in a liver cells plasma membrane leads to activation of glycogen phosphorylase transduction sometimes occurs in a single step but more often requires a sequence of changes in a series of different moleculesa signal transduction pathway the molecules in the pathway are often called relay molecules 3 response in the third stage of cell signaling the transduced signal finally triggers a specific cellular response the response may be almost any imaginable cellular activitysuch as catalysis by an enzyme for example glycogen phosphorylase rearrangement of the cytoskeleton or activation of specific genes in the nucleus the cellsignaling process helps ensure that crucial activities like these occur in the right cells at the right time and in proper coordination with the activities of other cells of the organism well now explore the mechanisms of cell signaling in more detail including a discussion of regulation and termination of the process local and longdistance cell signaling by secreted molecules in animals in both local and longdistance signaling only specific target cells that can recognize a given signaling molecule will respond to it a paracrine signaling a secreting cell acts on nearby target cells by secreting molecules of a local regulator a growth factor for example b synaptic signaling a nerve cell releases neurotransmitter molecules into a synapse stimulating the target cell such as a muscle or nerve cell c endocrine hormonal signaling specialized endocrine cells secrete hormones into body fluids often blood hormones reach virtually all body cells but are bound only by some cells,cells in multicellular organisms communicate through local and longdistance signaling mechanisms local signaling occurs via direct contact through cell junctions or through secreted signaling molecules for example paracrine signaling allows cells to secrete growth factors that stimulate nearby cells to grow and divide in synaptic signaling nerve cells release neurotransmitters across a synapse triggering responses in target cells longdistance signaling also known as endocrine signaling involves hormones secreted by specialized cells into the bloodstream hormones travel throughout the body and bind to specific target cells equipped with the necessary receptors the three stages of cell signaling include reception detection of a signaling molecule by the target cells receptor transduction the receptor undergoes a conformational change initiating a series of molecular events signal transduction pathway to convert the signal into a form that elicits a cellular response response the final result may include enzyme activation changes in the cytoskeleton or gene expression ensuring coordinated cellular activities these processes facilitate effective communication among cells enabling them to respond appropriately to environmental changes and physiological demands
a reception a signaling molecule bindsto a receptor protein causing it to change shape a radio station broadcasts its signal indiscriminately but it can be picked up only by radios tuned to the right frequency reception of the signal depends on the receiver similarly the signals emitted by an a yeast cell are heard only by its prospective mates cells in the case of the epinephrine circulating throughout the bloodstream of the impala in figure 111 the hormone encounters many types of cells but only certain target cells detect and react to the hormone molecule a receptor protein on or in the target cell allows the cell to hear the signal and respond to it the signaling molecule is complementary in shape to a specific site on the receptor and attaches there like a key in a lock the signaling molecule acts as a ligand the term for a molecule that specifically binds to another molecule often a larger one ligand binding generally causes a receptor protein to undergo a change in shape for many receptors this shape change directly activates the receptor enabling it to interact with other cellular molecules for other kinds of receptors the immediate effect of ligand binding is to cause the aggregation of two or more receptor molecules which leads to further molecular events inside the cell most signal receptors are plasma membrane proteins but others are located inside the cell we discuss both of these types next receptors in the plasma membrane cellsurface receptor proteins play crucial roles in the biological systems of animals the largest family of human cell surface receptors are the nearly 1000 g proteincoupled receptors gpcrs an example is shown in figure 117 most watersoluble signaling molecules bind to specific sites on transmembrane receptor proteins that transmit information from the extracellular environment to the inside of the cell we can see how cellsurface transmembrane receptors work by looking at three major types g proteincoupled receptors gpcrs receptor tyrosine kinases and ion channel receptors these receptors are discussed and illustrated in figure 118 study this figure before going on given the many important functions of cellsurface receptors it is not surprising that their malfunctions are associated with many human diseases including cancer heart disease and asthma to better understand and treat these conditions a major focus of both university research teams and the pharmaceutical industry has been to analyze the structure of these receptors exploring cellsurface transmembrane receptors g proteincoupled receptors a g proteincoupled receptor gpcr is a cellsurface transmembrane receptor that works with the help of a g protein a protein that binds the energyrich molecule gtp many different signaling moleculesincluding yeast mating factors epinephrine adrenaline and many other hormones as well as neurotransmittersuse gpcrs these receptors vary in the binding sites for their signaling molecules often referred to as their ligands and also for different types of g proteins inside the cell nevertheless gpcr proteins are all remarkably similar in structure in fact they make up a large family of eukaryotic receptor proteins with a secondary structure in which the single polypeptide represented here in a ribbon model has seven transmembrane helices outlined with cylinders and depicted in a row for clarity specific loops between the helices here the loops on the right form binding sites for signaling molecules outside the cell and g proteins on the cytoplasmic side gpcrbased signaling systems are extremely widespread and diverse in their functions including roles in embryonic development and sensory reception in humans for example vision smell and taste depend on gpcrs similarities in structure in g proteins and gpcrs in diverse organisms suggest that g proteins and their associated receptors evolved very early among eukaryotes malfunctions of the associated g proteins themselves are involved in many human diseases including bacterial infections the bacteria that cause cholera pertussis whooping cough and botulism among others make their victims ill by producing toxins that interfere with g protein function pharmacologists now realize that up to 60 of all medicines used today exert their effects by influencing g protein pathways 1 loosely attached to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane the g protein functions as a molecular switch that is either on or off depending on which of two guanine nucleotides is attached gdp or gtphence the term g protein gtp or guanosine triphosphate is similar to atp when gdp is bound to the g protein as shown above the g protein is inactive the receptor and g protein work together with another protein usually an enzyme 2when the appropriate signaling molecule binds to the extracellular side of the receptor the receptor is activated and changes shape its cytoplasmic side then binds an inactive g protein causing a gtp to displace the gdp this activates the g protein 3the activated g protein dissociates from the receptor diffuses along the membrane and then binds to an enzyme altering the enzymes shape and activity once activated the enzyme can trigger the next step leading to a cellular response binding of signaling molecules is reversible like other ligands they bind and dissociate many times the ligand concentration outside the cell determines how often a ligand is bound and causes signaling 4 the changes in the enzyme and g protein are only temporary because the g protein also functions as a gtpase enzymein other words it then hydrolyzes its bound gtp to gdp and now inactive again the g protein leaves the enzyme which returns to its original state the g protein is now available for reuse the gtpase function of the g protein allows the pathway to shut down rapidly when the signaling molecule is no longer present,cell signaling begins with reception where a signaling molecule known as a ligand binds to a specific receptor protein on the target cell initiating a change in the receptors shapesimilar to a key fitting into a lock this binding activates the receptor enabling it to trigger various cellular responses among the main types of cellsurface receptors are g proteincoupled receptors gpcrs these receptors interact with g proteins which function as molecular switches that can toggle between an active gtpbound and an inactive gdpbound state when a ligand binds to a gpcr it activates the receptor allowing it to bind an inactive g protein and exchange gdp for gtp thereby activating the g protein and facilitating further signaling receptor tyrosine kinases upon ligand binding these receptors typically dimerize activating their intrinsic kinase activity to phosphorylate tyrosine residues initiating a cascade of cellular responses ion channel receptors these receptors allow specific ions to flow into the cell when activated by a ligand leading to rapid changes in the cells membrane potential malfunctions in these receptors are linked to diseases such as cancer and heart disease making them critical targets for drug development
exploring cellsurface transmembrane receptors receptor tyrosine kinases receptor tyrosine kinases rtks belong to a major class of plasma membrane receptors characterized by having enzymatic activity a kinase is any enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of phosphate groups the part of the receptor protein extending into the cytoplasm functions more specifically as a tyrosine kinase an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from atp to the amino acid tyrosine on a substrate protein thus rtks are membrane receptors that attach phosphates to tyrosines one rtk may activate ten or more different transduction pathways and cellular responses often more than one signal transduction pathway can be triggered at once helping the cell regulate and coordinate many aspects of cell growth and cell reproduction the ability of a single ligandbinding event to trigger so many pathways is a key difference between rtks and gpcrs which activate a single transduction pathway abnormal rtks that function even in the absence of signaling molecules are associated with many kinds of cancer 1 many receptor tyrosine kinases have the structure depicted schematically here before the signaling molecule binds the receptors exist as individual units referred to as monomers notice that each has an extracellular ligandbinding site an helix spanning the membrane and an intracellular tail containing multiple tyrosines 2 the binding of a signaling molecule such as a growth factor causes two receptor monomers to associate closely with each other forming a complex known as a dimer in a process called dimerization in some cases larger clusters form the details of monomer association are a focus of current research 3 dimerization activates the tyrosine kinase region of each monomer each tyrosine kinase adds a phosphate from an atp molecule to a tyrosine on the tail of the other monomer 4 now that the receptor is fully activated it is recognized by specific relay proteins inside the cell each such protein binds to a specific phosphorylated tyrosine undergoing a resulting structural change that activates the bound protein each activated protein triggers a transduction pathway leading to a cellular response ion channel receptors a ligandgated ion channel is a type of membrane receptor containing a region that can act as a gate when the receptor changes shape when a signaling molecule binds as a ligand to the receptor protein the gate opens or closes allowing or blocking the flow of specific ions such as na or ca2 through a channel in the receptor like the other receptors we have discussed these proteins bind the ligand at a specific site on their extracellular sides 1 here we show a ligandgated ion channel receptor in which the gate remains closed until a ligand binds to the receptor 2 when the ligand binds to the receptor and the gate opens specific ions can flow through the channel and rapidly change the concentration of that particular ion inside the cell this change may directly affect the activity of the cell in some way 3 when the ligand dissociates from this receptor the gate closes and ions no longer enter the cell ligandgated ion channels are very important in the nervous system for example the neurotransmitter molecules released at a synapse between two nerve cells see figure 115b bind as ligands to ion channels on the receiving cell causing the channels to open ions flow in or in some cases out triggering an electrical signal that propagates down the length of the receiving cell some gated ion channels are controlled by electrical signals instead of ligands these voltagegated ion channels are also crucial to the functioning of the nervous system as we will discuss in chapter 48 some ion channels are present on membranes of organelles such as the er although cellsurface receptors represent 30 of all human proteins determining their structures has proved challenging they make up only 1 of the proteins whose structures have been determined by xray crystallography see figure 522 for one thing cellsurface receptors tend to be flexible and inherently unstable thus difficult to crystallize it took years of persistent efforts for researchers to determine the first few of these structures such as the gpcr shown in figure 117 in that case the adrenergic receptor was stable enough to be crystallized while it was among membrane molecules in the presence of its ligand abnormal functioning of receptor tyrosine kinases rtks is associated with many types of cancers for example breast cancer patients have a poor prognosis if their tumor cells harbor excessive levels of a receptor tyrosine kinase called her2 see concept 123 and figure 1827 using molecular biological techniques researchers have developed a protein called herceptin that binds to her2 on cells and inhibits cell division thus thwarting further tumor development in some clinical studies treatment with herceptin improved patient survival rates by more than onethird one goal of ongoing research into these cellsurface receptors and other cellsignaling proteins is development of additional successful treatments intracellular receptors intracellular receptor proteins are found in either the cytoplasm or nucleus of target cells to reach such a receptor a signaling molecule passes through the target cells plasma membrane a number of important signaling molecules can do this because they are either hydrophobic enough or small enough to cross the hydrophobic interior of the membrane these hydrophobic chemical messengers include the steroid hormones and thyroid hormones of animals another chemical signaling molecule with an intracellular receptor is nitric oxide no a gas its very small molecules readily pass between the membrane phospholipids once a hormone has entered a cell it may bind to an intracellular receptor in the cytoplasm or the nucleus the binding changes the receptor into a hormonereceptor complex that is able to cause a responsein many cases the turning on or off of particular genes the behavior of aldosterone is a representative example of how steroid hormones work this hormone is secreted by cells of the adrenal gland a gland that sits above the kidney aldosterone then travels through the blood and enters cells all over the body however a response occurs only in kidney cells which contain receptor molecules for this hormone in these cells the hormone binds to the receptor protein activating it with aldosterone attached the active form of the receptor protein then enters the nucleus and turns on specific genes that control water and sodium flow in kidney cells ultimately affecting blood volume figure 119 how does the activated hormonereceptor complex turn on genes recall that the genes in a cells dna function by being transcribed and processed into messenger rna mrna which leaves the nucleus and is translated into a specific protein by ribosomes in the cytoplasm see figure 523 special proteins called transcription factors control which genes are turned onthat is which genes are transcribed into mrna in a particular cell at a particular time when the aldosterone receptor is activated it acts as a transcription factor that turns on specific genes youll learn more about transcription factors in chapters 17 and 18 by acting as a transcription factor the aldosterone receptor itself carries out the transduction part of the signaling pathway most other intracellular receptors function in the same way although many of them such as the thyroid hormone receptor are already in the nucleus before the signaling molecule reaches them interestingly many of these intracellular receptor proteins are structurally similar suggesting an evolutionary kinship,receptor tyrosine kinases rtks are a crucial class of plasma membrane receptors that have intrinsic enzymatic activity specifically functioning as tyrosine kinases they catalyze the transfer of phosphate groups from atp to tyrosine residues on substrate proteins allowing a single rtk to activate multiple signal transduction pathways facilitating cell growth and reproduction rtks exist as monomers until a signaling molecule eg growth factor causes them to dimerize activating their kinase activity and initiating signaling cascades ion channel receptors are another type of membrane receptor that regulates ion flow across the cell membrane when a ligand binds it induces a conformational change opening or closing the channel to allow specific ions like na or ca to enter or exit the cell this process is critical for functions such as neuronal signaling intracellular receptors found in the cytoplasm or nucleus bind hydrophobic signaling molecules eg steroid hormones that can cross the plasma membrane upon binding these receptors often act as transcription factors regulating gene expression for example aldosterone binds to its receptor in kidney cells activating genes that control sodium and water balance impacting blood volume
transduction cascades of molecular interactions relay signals from receptors to target molecules in the cell when receptors for signaling molecules are plasma membrane proteins like most of those we have discussed the transduction stage of cell signaling is usually a multistep pathway involving many molecules steps often include activation of proteins by addition or removal of phosphate groups or release of other small molecules or ions that act as messengers one benefit of multiple steps is the possibility of greatly amplifying a signal if each molecule in a pathway transmits the signal to numerous molecules at the next step in the series the result is a geometric increase in the number of activated molecules by the end of the pathway moreover multistep pathways provide more opportunities for coordination and control than do simpler systems this allows regulation of the response as well discuss later in the chapter signal transduction pathways the binding of a specific signaling molecule to a receptor in the plasma membrane triggers the first step in the chain of molecular interactionsthe signal transduction pathway that leads to a particular response within the cell like falling dominoes the signalactivated receptor activates another molecule which activates yet another molecule and so on until the protein that produces the final cellular response is activated the molecules that relay a signal from receptor to response which we call relay molecules in this book are often proteins the interaction of proteins is a major theme of cell signaling indeed protein interaction is a unifying theme of all cellular activities keep in mind that the original signaling molecule is not physically passed along a signaling pathway in most cases it never even enters the cell when we say that the signal is relayed along a pathway we mean that certain information is passed on at each step the signal is transduced into a different form commonly a shape change in the next protein very often the shape change is brought about by phosphorylation protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation previous chapters introduced the concept of activating a protein by adding one or more phosphate groups to it see figure 811a in figure 118 you have already seen how phosphorylation is involved in the activation of receptor tyrosine kinases in fact the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of proteins is a widespread cellular mechanism for regulating protein activity an enzyme that transfers phosphate groups from atp to a protein is generally known as a protein kinase recall that a receptor tyrosine kinase is a specific kind of protein kinase that phosphorylates tyrosines on the other receptor tyrosine kinase in a dimer most cytoplasmic protein kinases however act on proteins different from themselves another distinction is that most cytoplasmic protein kinases phosphorylate either of two other amino acids serine or threonine rather than tyrosine serinethreonine kinases are widely involved in signaling pathways in animals plants and fungi many of the relay molecules in signal transduction pathways are protein kinases and they often act on other protein kinases in the pathway figure 1110 depicts a hypothetical pathway containing three different protein kinases that create a phosphorylation cascade the sequence of steps shown in the figure is similar to many known pathways including those triggered in yeast by mating factors and in animal cells by many growth factors the signal is transmitted by a cascade of protein phosphorylations each causing a shape change because of the interaction of the newly added phosphate groups with charged or polar amino acids on the protein being phosphorylated see figure 514 the change in shape alters the function of the protein most often activating it in some cases though phosphorylation decreases the activity of the protein the importance of protein kinases can hardly be overstated about 2 of our own genes are thought to code for protein kinases a single cell may have hundreds of different kinds each specific for a different substrate protein together they probably regulate the activity of a large proportion of the thousands of proteins in a cell among these are most of the proteins that in turn regulate cell division abnormal activity of such a kinase can cause abnormal cell division and contribute to the development of cancer equally important in the phosphorylation cascade are the protein phosphatases enzymes that can rapidly remove phosphate groups from proteins a process called dephosphorylation by dephosphorylating and thus inactivating protein kinases phosphatases provide the mechanism for turning off the signal transduction pathway when the initial signal is no longer present phosphatases also make the protein kinases available for reuse enabling the cell to respond again to an extracellular signal the phosphorylationdephosphorylation system acts as a molecular switch in the cell turning activities on or off or up or down as required at any given moment the activity of a protein regulated by phosphorylation depends on the balance in the cell between active kinase molecules and active phosphatase molecules a phosphorylation cascade in a phosphorylation cascade a series of different proteins in a pathway are phosphorylated in turn each protein adding a phosphate group to the next one in line here phosphorylation activates each protein and dephosphorylation returns it to its inactive form the active and inactive forms of each protein are represented by different shapes to remind you that activation is usually associated with a change in molecular shape 1a relay molecule activates protein kinase 1 2 active protein kinase 1 transfers a phosphate from atp to an inactive molecule of protein kinase 2 thus activating this second kinase 3 active protein kinase 2 then catalyzes the phosphorylation and activation of protein kinase 3 4 finally active protein kinase 3 phosphorylates a protein purple that brings about the cells response to the signal 5 enzymes called protein phosphatases pp catalyze the removal of the phosphate groups from the proteins making them inactive and available for reuse,signal transduction is a crucial process in cellular communication where cells convert external signals into specific internal responses through cascades of molecular interactions when a signaling molecule binds to a plasma membrane receptor it triggers a multistep signal transduction pathway this pathway often amplifies the initial signal allowing for a geometric increase in the number of activated molecules which enhances the cells ability to respond to stimuli key processes phosphorylation cascade this series of events involves the sequential activation of proteins by adding phosphate groups through enzymes called protein kinases each activated kinase can activate multiple downstream proteins resembling a chain reaction similar to falling dominoes relay molecules typically proteins these molecules convey signals from receptors to target proteins ensuring that the information is accurately passed along the pathway protein kinases these enzymes are essential for activating proteins and regulating various cellular processes including cell division protein phosphatases these enzymes remove phosphate groups thereby deactivating proteins and allowing the cell to reset its signaling pathways the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation processes act as molecular switches enabling cells to finely tune their responses based on external signals
small molecules and ions as second messengers not all components of signal transduction pathways are proteins many signaling pathways also involve small nonprotein watersoluble molecules or ions called second messengers this term is used because the pathways first messenger is considered to be the extracellular signaling moleculethe ligandthat binds to the membrane receptor because second messengers are small and also watersoluble they can readily spread throughout the cell by diffusion for example as well see shortly a second messenger called cyclic amp carries the signal initiated by epinephrine from the plasma membrane of a liver or muscle cell into the cells interior where the signal eventually brings about glycogen breakdown second messengers participate in pathways that are initiated by both g proteincoupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases the two most widely used second messengers are cyclic amp and calcium ions ca2 a large variety of relay proteins are sensitive to the cytosolic concentration of one or the other of these second messengers cyclic amp as discussed previously earl sutherland established that epinephrine somehow causes glycogen breakdown without passing through the plasma membrane this discovery prompted him to search for a second messenger that transmits the signal from the plasma membrane to the metabolic machinery in the cytoplasm sutherland found that the binding of epinephrine to the plasma membrane of a liver cell elevates the cytosolic concentration of a compound called cyclic adenosine monophosphate abbreviated as either cyclic amp or camp figure 1111 an enzyme embedded in the plasma membrane adenylyl cyclase converts atp to camp in response to an extracellular signalin this case provided by epinephrine but epinephrine doesnt stimulate adenylyl cyclase directly when epinephrine outside the cell binds to a specific receptor protein the protein activates adenylyl cyclase which in turn can catalyze the synthesis of many molecules of camp in this way the normal cellular concentration of camp can be boosted 20fold in a matter of seconds the camp broadcasts the signal to the cytoplasm it does not persist for long in the absence of the hormone because another enzyme called phosphodiesterase converts camp to amp another surge of epinephrine is needed to boost the cytosolic concentration of camp again subsequent research has revealed that epinephrine is only one of many hormones and other signaling molecules that trigger the formation of camp it has also brought to light the other components of camp pathways including g proteins g proteincoupled receptors and protein kinases figure 1112 the immediate effect of an elevation in camp levels is usually the activation of a serinethreonine kinase called protein kinase a the activated protein kinase a then phosphorylates various other proteins depending on the cell type the complete pathway for epinephrines stimulation of glycogen breakdown is shown later in figure 1116 further regulation of cell metabolism is provided by other g protein systems that inhibit adenylyl cyclase in these systems a different signaling molecule activates a different receptor which in turn activates an inhibitory g protein that blocks activation of adenylyl cyclase now that we know about the role of camp in g protein signaling pathways we can explain in molecular detail how certain microbes cause disease consider cholera a disease that is frequently epidemic in places where the water supply is contaminated with human feces people acquire the cholera bacterium vibrio cholerae by drinking contaminated water the bacteria form a biofilm on the lining of the small intestine and produce a toxin the cholera toxin is an enzyme that chemically modifies a g protein involved in regulating salt and water secretion because the modified g protein is unable to hydrolyze gtp to gdp it remains stuck in its active form continuously stimulating adenylyl cyclase to make camp the resulting high concentration of camp causes the intestinal cells to secrete large amounts of salts into the intestines with water following by osmosis an infected person quickly develops profuse diarrhea and if left untreated can soon die from the loss of water and salts our understanding of signaling pathways involving cyclic amp or related messengers has allowed us to develop treatments for certain conditions in humans in one pathway cyclic gmp or cgmp acts as a signaling molecule whose effects include relaxation of smooth muscle cells in artery walls a compound that inhibits the hydrolysis of cgmp to gmp thus prolonging the signal was originally prescribed for chest pains because it increased blood flow to the heart muscle under the trade name viagra this compound is now widely used as a treatment for erectile dysfunction in human males because viagra leads to dilation of blood vessels it also allows increased blood flow to the penis optimizing physiological conditions for penile erections calcium ions and inositol trisphosphate ip3 many of the signaling molecules that function in animals including neurotransmitters growth factors and some hormonesinduce responses in their target cells via signal transduction pathways that increase the cytosolic concentration of calcium ions ca2 calcium is even more widely used than camp as a second messenger increasing the cytosolic concentration of ca2 causes many responses in animal cells including muscle cell contraction secretion of certain substances and cell division in plant cells a wide range of hormonal and environmental stimuli can cause brief increases in cytosolic ca2 concentration triggering various signaling pathways such as the pathway for greening in response to light see figure 394 cells use ca2 as a second messenger in pathways triggered by both g proteincoupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases although cells always contain some ca2 this ion can function as a second messenger because its concentration in the cytosol is normally much lower than the concentration outside the cell figure 1113 in fact the level of ca2 in the blood and extracellular fluid of an animal is often more than 10000 times higher than that in the cytosol calcium ions are actively transported out of the cell and are actively imported from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum and under some conditions into mitochondria and chloroplasts by various protein pumps as a result the calcium concentration in the er is usually much higher than that in the cytosol because the cytosolic calcium level is low a small change in absolute numbers of ions represents a relatively large percentage change in calcium concentration in response to a signal relayed by a signal transduction pathway the cytosolic calcium level may rise usually by a mechanism that releases ca2 from the cells er the pathways leading to calcium release involve two other second messengers inositol trisphosphate ip3 and diacylglycerol dag these two messengers are produced by cleavage of a certain kind of phospholipid in the plasma membrane figure 1114 shows the complete picture of how a signal causes ip3 to stimulate the release of calcium from the er because ip3 acts before calcium in these pathways calcium could be considered a third messenger however scientists use the term second messenger for all small nonprotein components of signal transduction pathways,in cellular signal transduction second messengerssmall nonprotein watersoluble molecules or ionsplay a vital role in relaying signals initiated by extracellular signaling molecules first messengers that bind to membrane receptors these second messengers such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate camp and calcium ions ca can quickly diffuse throughout the cell amplifying the signal and triggering various responses key components cyclic amp camp formed from atp by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase camp is activated by hormones like epinephrine it activates protein kinase a pka leading to diverse cellular responses such as glycogen breakdown calcium ions ca used extensively in signal transduction ca concentrations rise in response to signaling molecules causing muscle contractions secretion and cell division the concentration of ca is normally much lower inside the cell compared to the extracellular fluid inositol trisphosphate ip3 and diacylglycerol dag these second messengers are produced from membrane phospholipids and help release ca from the endoplasmic reticulum facilitating cellular responses understanding these mechanisms aids in developing treatments for conditions like cholera and erectile dysfunction
calcium and ip3 in signaling pathways calcium ions ca2 and inositol trisphosphate ip3 function as second messengers in many signal transduction pathways in this figure the process is initiated by the binding of a signaling molecule to a g proteincoupled receptor a receptor tyrosine kinase could also initiate this pathway by activating phospholipase c 1 a signaling molecule binds to a receptor leading to activation of phospholipase c 2 phospholipase c cleaves a plasma membrane phospholipid called pip2 into dag and ip3 3 dag functions as a second messenger in other pathways 4ip3 quickly diffuses through the cytosol and binds to an ip3 gated calcium channel in the er membrane causing it to open 5 calcium ions flow out of the er down their concentration gradient raising the ca2 level in the cytosol 6 the calcium ions activate the next protein in one or more signaling pathways response cell signaling leads to regulation of transcription or cytoplasmic activities we now take a closer look at the cells subsequent response to an extracellular signalwhat some researchers call the output response what is the nature of the final step in a signaling pathway nuclear and cytoplasmic responses ultimately a signal transduction pathway leads to the regulation of one or more cellular activities the response at the end of the pathway may occur in the nucleus of the cell or in the cytoplasm many signaling pathways ultimately regulate protein synthesis usually by turning specific genes on or off in the nucleus like an activated steroid receptor see figure 119 the final activated molecule in a signaling pathway may function as a transcription factor figure 1115 shows an example in which a signaling pathway activates a transcription factor that turns a gene on the response to this growth factor signal is transcription the synthesis of one or more specific mrnas which will be translated in the cytoplasm into specific proteins in other cases the transcription factor might regulate a gene by turning it off often a transcription factor regulates several different genes sometimes a signaling pathway may regulate the activity of proteins rather than causing their synthesis by activating gene expression this directly affects proteins that function outside the nucleus for example a signal may cause the opening or closing of an ion channel in the plasma membrane or a change in cell metabolism as we have seen the response of liver cells to the hormone epinephrine helps regulate cellular energy metabolism by affecting the activity of an enzyme the final step in the signaling pathway that begins with epinephrine binding activates the enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of glycogen figure 1116 shows the complete pathway leading to the release of glucose 1phosphate molecules from glycogen notice that as each molecule is activated the response is amplified a subject well return to shortly signal receptors relay molecules and second messengers participate in a variety of pathways leading to both nuclear and cytoplasmic responses some of these pathways lead to cell division the molecular messengers that initiate cell division pathways include growth factors and certain plant and animal hormones malfunctioning of growth factor pathways like the one in figure 1115 can contribute to the development of cancer as well see in chapter 18 regulation of the response whether the response occurs in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm it is not simply turned on or off rather the extent and specificity of the response are regulated in multiple ways here well consider four aspects of this regulation first as mentioned earlier signaling pathways generally amplify the cells response to a single signaling event the degree of amplification depends on the function of the specific molecules in the pathway second the many steps in a multistep pathway provide control points at which the cells response can be further regulated contributing to the specificity of the response and allowing coordination with other signaling pathways third the overall efficiency of the response is enhanced by the presence of proteins known as scaffolding proteins finally a crucial point in regulating the response is the termination of the signal,calcium ions ca and inositol trisphosphate ip3 serve as vital second messengers in numerous signal transduction pathways initiating responses to extracellular signals the process starts when a signaling molecule binds to a cell surface receptor activating phospholipase c this enzyme cleaves the phospholipid pip2 into diacylglycerol dag and ip3 while dag acts in other pathways ip3 diffuses rapidly through the cytoplasm and binds to ip3gated calcium channels in the endoplasmic reticulum er prompting the release of ca into the cytosol this increase in intracellular ca activates various proteins influencing cellular responses the ultimate goal of these pathways is often to regulate cellular activities such as gene expression activated transcription factors in the nucleus can turn specific genes on or off leading to protein synthesis in contrast some pathways regulate proteins in the cytoplasm affecting functions like metabolism or ion channel activity key aspects of regulation include amplification enhances the cells response to signals control points allows finetuning of responses for specificity scaffolding proteins organize pathway components for efficiency signal termination ensures appropriate and temporary responses
the body and its constituents the human body is complex like a highly technical and sophisticated machine it operates as a single entity but is made up of a number of operational parts that work interdependently each part is associated with a specific and sometimes related function that is essential for the wellbeing of the individual the component parts do not operate independently but rather in conjunction with all the others should one part fail the consequences are likely to extend to other parts and may reduce the ability of the body to function normally integrated working of the body parts ensures the ability of the individual to survive the human body is therefore complex in both its structure and function and the aim of this book is to explain the fundamental structures and processes involved anatomy is the study of the structure of the body and the physical relationships involved between body parts physiology is the study of how the parts of the body work and the ways in which they cooperate together to maintain life and health of the individual pathology is the study of abnormalities and how they affect body functions often causing illness building on the normal anatomy and physiology relevant illnesses are considered at the end of the later chapters levels of structural complexity within the body there are different levels of structural organisation and complexity fig 11 the lowest level is chemical atoms combine to form molecules of which there is a vast range in the body the structures properties and functions of important biological molecules are considered in chapter 2 cells are the smallest independent units of living matter and there are millions in the body they are too small to be seen with the naked eye but when magnified using a microscope different types can be distinguished by their size shape and the dyes they absorb when stained in the laboratory each cell type has become specialised and carries out a particular function that contributes to body needs in complex organisms such as the human body cells with similar structures and functions are found together forming tissues the structure and functions of cells and tissues are explored in chapter 3 organs are made up of a number of different types of tissue and carry out a specific function systems consist of a number of organs and tissues that together contribute to one or more survival needs of the body the human body has several systems which work interdependently carrying out specific functions all are required for health the body systems are considered in later chapters the internal environment and homeostasis the external environment surrounds the body and provides the oxygen and nutrients required by all the cells of the body waste products of cellular activity are eventually excreted into the external environment the skin provides a barrier between the dry external environment and the watery environment of most body cells the internal environment is the waterbased medium in which body cells exist cells are bathed in fluid called interstitial or tissue fluid oxygen and other substances they require must pass from the internal transport systems through the interstitial fluid to reach them similarly cell waste products must move through the interstitial fluid to the transport systems to be excreted cells are surrounded by the cell membrane which provides a potential barrier to substances entering or leaving the structure of membranes p 30 confers certain properties in particular selective permeability or semipermeability this prevents large molecules moving between the cell and the interstitial fluid fig 12 smaller particles can usually pass through the membrane some more readily than others and therefore the chemical composition of the fluid inside is different from that outside the cell homeostasis the composition of the internal environment is maintained within narrow limits and this fairly constant state is called homeostasis literally this term means unchanging but in practice it describes a dynamic everchanging situation kept within narrow limits when this balance is threatened or lost there is a serious risk to the wellbeing of the individual there are many factors in the internal environment which must be maintained within narrow limits and some of these are listed in box 11 homeostasis is maintained by control systems which detect and respond to changes in the internal environment a control system fig 13 has three basic components detector control centre and effector the control centre determines the limits within which the variable factor should be maintained it receives an input from the detector or sensor and integrates the incoming information when the incoming signal indicates that an adjustment is needed the control centre responds and its output to the effector is changed this is a dynamic process that maintains homeostasis negative feedback mechanisms in systems controlled by negative feedback the effector response decreases or negates the effect of the original stimulus restoring homeostasis thus the term negative feedback control of body temperature is similar to the nonphysiological example of a domestic central heating system the thermostat temperature detector is sensitive to changes in room temperature variable factor the thermostat is connected to the boiler control unit control centre which controls the boiler effector the thermostat constantly compares the information from the detector with the preset temperature and when necessary adjustments are made to alter the room temperature when the thermostat detects the room temperature is low it sends an input to the boiler control unit switching it on the result is output of heat by the boiler warming the room when the preset temperature is reached the system is reversed the thermostat detects the higher room temperature and sends an input to the boiler control unit turning it off the output of heat from the boiler stops and the room slowly cools as heat is lost this series of events is a negative feedback mechanism and it enables continuous selfregulation or control of a variable factor within a narrow range body temperature is a physiological variable controlled by negative feedback fig 14 when body temperature falls below the preset level this is detected by specialised temperature sensitive nerve endings they transmit this information as an input to groups of cells in the hypothalamus of the brain which form the control centre the output from the control centre activates mechanisms that raise body temperature effectors these include stimulation of skeletal muscles causing shivering narrowing of the blood vessels in the skin reducing the blood flow to and heat loss from the peripheries behavioural changes eg we put on more clothes or curl up when body temperature rises to within the normal range the temperature sensitive nerve endings no longer stimulate the cells of the control centre and therefore the output of this centre to the effectors ceases most of the homeostatic controls in the body use negative feedback mechanisms to prevent sudden and serious changes in the internal environment many more of these are explained in the following chapters positive feedback mechanisms there are only a few of these amplifier or cascade systems in the body in positive feedback mechanisms the stimulus progressively increases the response so that as long as the stimulus is continued the response is progressively being amplified examples include blood clotting and uterine contractions during labour during labour contractions of the uterus are stimulated by the hormone oxytocin these force the babys head into the cervix of the uterus stimulating stretch receptors there in response to this more of the hormone oxytocin is released further strengthening the contractions and maintaining labour after the baby is born the stimulus stretching of the cervix is no longer present and the release of oxytocin stops see fig 95 p 219 homeostatic imbalance this arises when the fine control of a factor in the internal environment is inadequate and the level of the factor falls outside the normal range if control cannot achieve homeostasis an abnormal state develops that may threaten health or even life many of these situations are explained in later chapters,the human body is a highly complex system composed of numerous interdependent parts that work together to maintain life and health anatomy focuses on the structure of the body and the relationships between its parts while physiology examines how these parts function in coordination pathology explores abnormalities and diseases that disrupt normal body functions the body is organized into various levels of complexity starting with atoms that form molecules which in turn build cells cells group into tissues which combine to form organs multiple organs work together within systems like the circulatory digestive or nervous systems all of which are essential for survival homeostasis is the process by which the body maintains a stable internal environment even when external conditions change this balance is achieved through control systems consisting of detectors control centers and effectors most homeostatic processes use negative feedback mechanisms like body temperature regulation to restore balance in contrast positive feedback mechanisms such as labor contractions amplify responses until a specific outcome is reached when homeostasis is disrupted homeostatic imbalances occur potentially leading to illness or disease these imbalances highlight the importance of the bodys regulatory systems in maintaining health
survival needs of the body by convention the body systems are described separately in the study of anatomy and physiology but in reality they are all interdependent this section provides an introduction to body activities linking them to survival needs table 11 the later chapters build on this framework exploring human structure and functions in health and illness using a systems approach communication in this section transport and communication are considered transport systems ensure that all cells have access to the internal and external environments the blood the circulatory system and lymphatic system are involved all communication systems involve receiving collating and responding to appropriate information there are different systems for communicating with the internal and external environments internal communication involves mainly the nervous and endocrine systems these are important in the maintenance of homeostasis and regulation of vital body functions communication with the external environment involves the special senses and verbal and nonverbal activities and all of these also depend on the nervous system transport systems blood the blood transports substances around the body through a large network of blood vessels in adults the body contains 5 to 6 1 of blood ch 4 it consists of two parts a sticky fluid called plasma and cells which are suspended in the plasma plasma this is mainly water with a wide range of substances dissolved or suspended in it these include nutrients absorbed from the alimentary canal oxygen absorbed from the lungs chemical substances synthesised by body cells eg hormones waste materials produced by body cells to be eliminated from the body by excretion blood cells there are three distinct groups classified according to their functions fig 15 erythrocytes red blood cells are concerned with the transport of oxygen and to a lesser extent carbon dioxide between the lungs and all body cells leukocytes white blood cells are mainly concerned with protection of the body against microbes and other potentially damaging substances that gain entry to the body there are several types of leukocytes which carry out their protective functions in different ways these cells are larger than erythrocytes and are less numerous thrombocytes platelets are tiny cell fragments which play an essential part in the very complex process of blood clotting circulatory system ch 5 this consists of a network of blood vessels and the heart fig 16 blood vessels there are three types arteries which carry blood away from the heart veins which return blood to the heart capillaries which link the arteries and veins capillaries are tiny blood vessels with very thin walls consisting of only one layer of cells they are the site of exchange of substances between the blood and body tissues eg nutrients oxygen and cellular waste products blood vessels form a network that transports blood to the lungs pulmonary circulation where oxygen is absorbed from the air in the lungs and at the same time carbon dioxide is excreted from the blood into the air cells in all parts of the body general or systemic circulation heart the heart is a muscular sac it pumps the blood round the body and maintains the blood pressure in the lungs and general circulation this is essential for life the heart muscle is not under conscious voluntary control at rest the heart contracts between 65 and 75 times per minute the rate may be greatly increased during physical exercise when the oxygen and nutritional needs of the muscles moving the limbs are increased and in some emotional states the rate at which the heart beats can be counted by taking the pulse the pulse can be felt most easily where an artery lies close to the surface of the body and can be pressed gently against a bone the wrist is the site most commonly used for this purpose lymphatic system the lymphatic system ch 6 consists of a series of lymph vessels which begin as blindended tubes in the spaces between the blood capillaries and tissue cells fig 17 structurally they are similar to veins and blood capillaries but the pores in the walls of the lymph capillaries are larger than those of the blood capillaries lymph is tissue fluid containing large molecules eg proteins fragments of damaged tissue cells and microbes it is transported along lymph vessels and is returned to the bloodstream there are collections of lymph nodes situated at various points along the length of the lymph vessels lymph is filtered as it passes through the lymph nodes and microbes noxious substances and some waste materials are removed the lymphatic system provides the sites for formation and maturation of lymphocytes the white blood cells involved in immunity internal communication communication and the nervous system the nervous system is a rapid communication system ch 7 the main components are shown in figure 18 the central nervous system consists of the brain situated inside the skull the spinal cord which extends from the base of the skull to the lumbar region and is protected from injury by the bones of the spinal column the peripheral nervous system is a network of nerve fibres which are sensory or afferent providing the brain with input from organs and tissues or motor or efferent which convey nerve impulses carrying output from the brain to effector organs the muscles and glands the somatic common senses are pain touch heat and cold and they arise following stimulation of specialised sensory receptors at nerve endings found throughout the skin there are different receptors in muscles and joints that respond to changes in the position and orientation of the body maintaining posture and balance yet other receptors are activated by stimuli in internal organs and maintain control of vital body functions eg heart rate respiratory rate and blood pressure stimulation of any of these receptors sets up impulses that are conducted to the brain in sensory afferent nerves communication along nerve fibres cells is by electrical impulses that are generated when nerve endings are stimulated communication between nerve cells is also required since more than one nerve is involved in the chain of events occurring between the initial stimulus and the physiological reaction to it nerves communicate with each other by releasing a chemical the neurotransmitter into tiny gaps between them the neurotransmitter quickly travels across the gap and either stimulates or inhibits the next nerve cell thus ensuring the message is transmitted sensory nerves and chemical substances circulating in the blood provide information to appropriate parts of the brain which collates it and then responds via motor nerves to effector organs often through a negative feedback mechanism fig 13 some of these activities are understood and perceived eg pain whereas others take place subconsciously eg changes in blood pressure nerve impulses travel at great speed along nerve fibres leading to rapid responses adjustments to many body functions occur within a few seconds communication and the endocrine system the endocrine system consists of a number of endocrine glands situated in different parts of the body they synthesise and secrete chemical messengers called hormones that circulate round the body in the blood hormones stimulate target glands or tissues influencing metabolic and other cellular activities and regulating body growth and maturation endocrine glands detect and respond to levels of particular substances in the blood including specific hormones changes in blood hormone levels are controlled by negative feedback mechanisms fig 13 the endocrine system provides slower and more precise control of body functions than the nervous system communication with the external environment special senses these senses arise following stimulation of specialised sensory receptor cells located in sensory organs or tissues in the head the senses and the special organs involved are shown in box 12 although these senses are usually considered separate and different from each other one sense is rarely used alone fig 19 for example when the smell of smoke is perceived then other senses such as sight and sound are used to try and locate the source of a fire similarly taste and smell are closely associated in the enjoyment or otherwise of food the brain collates incoming information with information from the memory and initiates a response by setting up electrical impulses in motor efferent nerves to effector organs muscles and glands such responses enable the individual to escape from the fire or to prepare the digestive system for eating verbal communication sound is a means of communication and is produced in the larynx as a result of blowing air through the space between the vocal cords during expiration speech is the manipulation of sound by contraction of the muscles of the throat and cheeks and movements of the tongue and lower jaw nonverbal communication posture and movements are associated with nonverbal communication eg nodding the head and shrugging the shoulders the skeletal system provides the bony framework of the body ch 16 and movement takes place at joints between bones skeletal muscles which move the bones lie between them and the skin they are stimulated by the part of the nervous system under conscious voluntary control some nonverbal communication eg changes in facial expression may not involve the movement of bones,the human body relies on interconnected systems to meet its survival needs transport systems such as the blood circulatory and lymphatic systems ensure that cells receive oxygen nutrients and hormones while waste is removed blood contains plasma and cells like erythrocytes for oxygen transport leukocytes for immune defense and platelets for clotting the lymphatic system aids in immunity by filtering harmful substances through lymph nodes communication systems involve the nervous and endocrine systems the nervous system provides fast electrical communication with sensory afferent nerves delivering information to the brain and motor efferent nerves sending signals to muscles and glands the endocrine system uses hormones for slow regulated control of body functions like growth and metabolism often managed through negative feedback mechanisms external communication depends on special senses sight hearing touch etc and both verbal speech and nonverbal posture movements forms of communication coordinated by the nervous system together these systems maintain homeostasis allowing the body to function efficiently and respond to its environment ensuring survival
intake of raw materials and elimination of waste this section considers the substances that must be taken into and excreted from the body oxygen water and food are the substances the body needs to take in and carbon dioxide urine and faeces are those excreted intake of oxygen oxygen is a gas that makes up about 21 of atmospheric air a continuous supply is essential for human life because most chemical activities that take place in the body cells can occur only in its presence oxygen is needed in the series of chemical reactions that result in the release of energy from nutrients the respiratory system carries air between the nose and the lungs during breathing ch 10 air passes through a system of passages consisting of the pharynx also part of the alimentary canal the larynx voice box the trachea two bronchi one bronchus to each lung and a large number of bronchial passages fig 110 these end in alveoli millions of tiny air sacs in each lung they are surrounded by a network of tiny capillaries and are the sites where the vital process of gas exchange between the lungs and the blood takes place fig 111 nitrogen which makes up about 80 of atmospheric air is breathed in and out but in this gaseous form it cannot be used by the body the nitrogen needed by the body is present in proteincontaining foods mainly meat and fish dietary intake nutrition is considered in chapter 11 a balanced diet is important for health and provides nutrients substances that are absorbed often following digestion and promote body function nutrients include water carbohydrates proteins fats vitamins and mineral salts they are required for maintaining water balance within the body energy production mainly carbohydrates and fats synthesis of large and complex molecules using mineral salts proteins fats carbohydrates and vitamins cell building growth and repair especially proteins digestion the digestive system has developed because the food eaten is chemically complex and seldom in a form the body cells can use its function is to break down or digest food so that it can be absorbed into the circulation and then used by body cells the digestive system consists of the alimentary tract and accessory glands fig 112 alimentary canal this is a tube that begins at the mouth and continues through the pharynx oesophagus stomach small and large intestines rectum and anus glands the accessory organs situated outside the alimentary canal with ducts leading into it are the salivary glands the pancreas and the liver there are also many small glands situated in the walls of the alimentary canal most of these glands synthesise digestive enzymes that are involved in the chemical breakdown of food metabolism this is the sum total of the chemical activity in the body it consists of two groups of processes anabolism building or synthesising large and complex substances catabolism breaking down substances to provide energy and raw materials for anabolism and substances for excretion as waste the sources of energy are mainly the carbohydrates and fats provided by the diet if these are in short supply proteins are used elimination of waste carbon dioxide this is continually excreted by the respiratory system as described above carbon dioxide is a waste product of cellular metabolism it dissolves in water to form an acid that must be excreted in appropriate amounts to maintain the ph acidity or alkalinity of the blood in its normal range urine this is formed by the kidneys which are part of the urinary system ch 13 the organs of the urinary system are shown in figure 113 urine consists of water and waste products mainly of protein breakdown eg urea under the influence of hormones from the endocrine system the kidneys regulate water balance within the body they also play a role in maintaining blood ph within the normal range the bladder stores urine until it is excreted during micturition the process of micturition passing urine also involves the nervous system faeces the waste materials from the digestive system are excreted as faeces containing indigestible food residue that remains in the alimentary canal because it cannot be absorbed bile from the liver which contains the waste products from the breakdown of red blood cells large numbers of microbes elimination of faeces defecation also involves the nervous system protection and survival in this section relevant activities will be outlined under the following headings protection against the external environment resistance and immunity movement and reproduction protection against the external environment on the body surface the skin ch 14 mainly provides this it consists of two layers the epidermis and the dermis the epidermis lies superficially and is composed of several layers of cells that grow towards the surface from its deepest layer the surface layer consists of dead cells that are constantly being rubbed off and replaced from below the epidermis constitutes the barrier between the moist environment of the living cells of the body and the dry atmosphere of the external environment the dermis contains tiny sweat glands that have little canals or ducts leading to the surface hairs grow from follicles in the dermis the layers of the skin form a barrier against invasion by microbes chemicals dehydration sensory nerve endings present in the dermis are stimulated by pain temperature and touch if the finger touches a very hot plate it is removed immediately this cycle of events is called a reflex action and is a very rapid motor response contraction of muscles to a sensory stimulus stimulation of sensory nerve endings in the skin this type of reflex action is an important protective mechanism that is mediated by the nervous system the skin also plays an important role in the regulation of body temperature resistance and immunity the body has many means of selfprotection from invaders ch 15 they are divided into two categories specific and nonspecific defense mechanisms,the body requires essential materials such as oxygen water and food while eliminating wastes like carbon dioxide urine and feces oxygen vital for cellular respiration enters the body through the respiratory system traveling from the nose to the lungs via the pharynx larynx and bronchi where gas exchange occurs in the alveoli nitrogen although abundant in the air is utilized by the body only through proteinrich foods a balanced diet provides necessary nutrients like carbohydrates proteins fats vitamins and minerals which support energy production growth and tissue repair the digestive system breaks down food into simpler forms that can be absorbed and used by the body it consists of the alimentary canal and accessory glands such as the salivary glands pancreas and liver metabolism includes anabolism building substances and catabolism breaking down substances for energy waste products including carbon dioxide are expelled by the respiratory system while urine formed in the kidneys eliminates protein breakdown products feces made up of undigested food bile and microbes are excreted through the digestive system the skin acts as a barrier against microbes chemicals and dehydration while also regulating body temperature reflex actions mediated by the nervous system provide rapid responses to harmful stimuli the immune system protects the body through both specific and nonspecific defense mechanisms
nonspecific defence mechanisms these are effective against any invaders the protection provided by the skin is outlined above in addition there are other protective features at body surfaces eg mucus secreted by mucous membranes traps microbes and other foreign materials on its sticky surface some body fluids contain antimicrobial substances eg gastric juice contains hydrochloric acid which kills most ingested microbes following successful invasion other nonspecific processes may occur including the inflammatory response which is also involved in tissue healing specific defence mechanisms the body generates a specific immune response against any substance it identifies as foreign such substances are called antigens and include bacteria and other microbes cancer cells or transplanted tissue cells pollen from flowers and plants reproduction successful reproduction is essential in order to ensure the continuation of a species from one generation to the next bisexual reproduction results from the fertilisation of a female egg cell or ovum by a male sperm cell or spermatozoon ova are produced by two ovaries situated in the female pelvis fig 115 usually only one ovum is released at a time and it travels towards the uterus in the uterine tube the spermatozoa are produced in large numbers by the two testes situated in the scrotum from each testis spermatozoa pass through a duct called the deferent duct vas deferens to the urethra during sexual intercourse coitus the spermatozoa are deposited in the female vagina they then pass upwards through the uterus and fertilise the ovum in the uterine tube the fertilised ovum zygote then passes into the uterus embeds itself in the uterine wall and grows to maturity during pregnancy or gestation in about 40 weeks the newborn baby is entirely dependent on others for food and protection that was provided by the mothers body before birth one ovum is produced about every 28 days during the childbearing years between puberty and the menopause when the ovum is not fertilised it passes out of the uterus accompanied by bleeding called menstruation the cycle in the female called the menstrual cycle has phases associated with changes in the concentration of hormones involving the endocrine system there is no similar cycle in the male but hormones similar to those of the female are involved in the production and maturation of the spermatozoa introduction to the study of illness in order to understand the specific diseases described in later chapters a knowledge of the relevant anatomy and physiology is necessary as well as familiarity with the pathological processes outlined below many different illnesses disorders and diseases are known and these vary from minor but often very troublesome conditions to the very serious the study of abnormalities can be made much easier when a systematic approach is adopted in order to achieve this in later chapters where specific diseases are explained the headings shown in box 13 will be used as a guide causes aetiology are outlined first when there are clear links between them and the effects of the abnormality pathogenesis aetiology disease is usually caused by one or more of a limited number of factors including genetic abnormalities either inherited or acquired infection by microbes or parasites eg viruses bacteria or worms chemicals ionising radiation physical trauma degeneration eg excessive use or ageing in some diseases more than one of the aetiological factors listed above is involved while in others no specific cause has been identified and these may be described as essential idiopathic or spontaneous for some diseases of which the precise cause is unknown links may have been established with predisposing factors or risk factors latrogenic conditions are those that result from harm caused by members of the caring professions pathogenesis the main processes causing illness or disease are as follows inflammation p 375 this is a tissuhe response to damage by eg trauma invasion of microbes inflammatory conditions are recognised by the suffix itis eg appendicitis tumours p 53 these arise when the rate of cell production exceeds that of normal cell destruction causing a mass to develop tumours are recognised by the suffix oma eg carcinoma abnormal immune mechanisms p 383 these are a response of the normally protective immune system that causes undesirable effects thrombosis embolism and infarction p 117 these are the effects and consequences of abnormal changes in the blood andor blood vessel walls degeneration this is often associated with normal ageing but also arises prematurely when structures deteriorate causing impaired function metabolic abnormalities cause undesirable effects eg phenylketonuria p 185 genetic abnormalities may be either inherited or caused by environmental factors such as exposure to ionising radiation,the body defends itself through nonspecific and specific mechanisms nonspecific defenses protect against all invaders including the skin mucus membranes and fluids like gastric juice that contain antimicrobial properties inflammatory responses help heal tissue damage specific defenses on the other hand involve the immune system targeting specific antigens like bacteria cancer cells and pollen reproduction is essential for the continuation of species it occurs when a male sperm fertilizes a female egg ovum forming a zygote that embeds in the uterus and matures during pregnancy females produce one ovum every 28 days controlled by hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle in males sperm production is continuous governed by similar hormones illness or disease studied in a field known as pathology arises from various causes such as genetic abnormalities infections chemicals radiation and physical trauma disease progression pathogenesis involves key processes like inflammation tissue response to damage tumor formation abnormal cell growth and immune dysfunction other conditions like thrombosis blood clotting degeneration agerelated tissue breakdown and metabolic disorders can also cause disease some illnesses are linked to genetic factors while others are idiopathic meaning their causes are unknown
important biological molecules carbohydrates the carbohydrates are the sugars carbohydrates are composed of carbon oxygen and hydrogen and the carbon atoms are normally arranged in a ring with the oxygen and hydrogen atoms linked to them the structures of glucose fructose and sucrose are shown in figure 27 when two sugars link up the reaction occurring expels a molecule of water and the resulting bond is called a glycosidic linkage simple sugars like glucose can exist as single units and are referred to as monosaccharides glucose is the main form in which sugar is used by cells and blood levels are tightly controlled frequently the monosaccharides are linked together the resultant molecule ranging from two sugars or disaccharides eg sucrose table sugar to long chains containing many thousands of sugars such complex carbohydrates are called polysaccharides eg starch glucose can be broken down metabolised in either the presence aerobically or the absence anaerobically of oxygen but the process is much more efficient when o2 is used during this process energy water and carbon dioxide are released p 315 this family of molecules serves as a ready source of energy to fuel cellular activities p 272 provides a form of energy storage eg glycogen p 315 forms an integral part of the structure of dna and rna p 25 can act as receptors on the cell surface allowing the cell to recognise other molecules and cells amino acids and proteins amino acids always contain carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen and many in addition carry sulphur in human biochemistry 20 amino acids are used as the principal building blocks of protein although there are others for instance there are some amino acids used only in certain proteins and some seen only in microbial products of the amino acids used in human protein synthesis there is a basic common structure including an amino group nh2 a carboxy group cooh and a hydrogen atom what makes one amino acid different from the next is a variable side chain the basic structure and three common amino acids are shown in figure 28 as in formation of glycosidic linkages when two amino acids join up the reaction expels a molecule of water and the resulting bond is called a peptide bond proteins are made from amino acids joined together and are the main family of molecules from which the human body is built protein molecules vary enormously in size shape chemical constituents and function many important groups of biologically active substances are proteins eg carrier molecules eg haemoglobin p 63 enzymes p 26 many hormones eg insulin p 225 antibodies p 380 proteins can also be used as an alternative energy source usually in dietary inadequacy although the process is much less efficient than when carbohydrates or fats are broken down lipids lipids are made up of carbon hydrogen and oxygen atoms one group of lipids the phospholipids form an integral part of the cell membrane one notable feature of lipid molecules is that they are strongly hydrophobic water hating and therefore lipids do not mix with water this is important in their function in the cell membrane p 30 other types of lipids include certain vitamins eg e and k an important group of hormones called steroids and the fats a molecule of fat consists of three fatty acids each linked to a molecule of glycerol fig 29 fats are a source of energy and provide a convenient form in which to store excess calorific intake when fats are broken down they release energy but the process is less efficient than when carbohydrates are used since it requires more energy for the breakdown reaction to take place they are used in the body for insulation protection of body parts energy storage nucleotides nucleic acids these are the largest molecules in the body and are built from components called nucleotides which consist of three subunits a sugar unit a base one or more phosphate groups linked together deoxyribonucleic acid dna this is a double strand of nucleotides arranged in a spiral helix which resembles a twisted ladder fig 210 chromosomes are clusters of dna molecules consisting of functional subunits called genes the nucleotides contain the sugar deoxyribose phosphate groups and one of four bases adenine a thymine t guanine g and cytosine c a in one chain is paired with t in the other and g with c in this way nucleotides are arranged in a precisely ordered manner in which one chain is complementary to the other dna acts as the template for protein synthesis and is stored safely in the nucleus ribonucleic acid rna this is a singlestranded chain of nucleotides which contains the sugar ribose instead of the deoxyribose found in dna it contains no thymine but uses uracil u instead it is synthesised in the nucleus from the dna template and carries the message instructing synthesis of a new protein from the dna which cannot leave the nucleus to the proteinsynthesising apparatus in the cell cytoplasm protein synthesis when cells require new protein a single strand of rna is made using dna as the template the rna leaves the nucleus rna acts as the messenger which carries the instructions for the assembly of the new protein to tiny structures in the cytoplasm called ribosomes p 32 ribosomes read the message and following the instructions assemble the new protein from amino acids in the cell cytoplasm fig 211 new chains of protein are often large molecules which coil up in a particular way to maintain stability of the molecule adenosine triphosphate atp atp is a nucleotide which contains ribose the sugar unit adenine the base and three phosphate groups attached to the ribose fig 212a it is sometimes known as the energy currency of the body which implies that the body has to earn synthesise it before it can spend it many of the bodys huge number of reactions release energy eg the breakdown of sugars in the presence of o2 the body captures the energy released by these reactions using it to make atp from adenosine diphosphate adp when the body needs chemical energy to fuel cellular activities atp releases its stored energy water and a phosphate group through the splitting of a highenergy phosphate bond and reverts to adp fig 212b the body needs chemical energy to drive synthetic reactions ie building biological molecules fuel movement transport substances across membranes enzymes many of the bodys chemical reactions can be reproduced in a testtube surprisingly the rate at which the reactions then occur usually plummets to the extent that for all practical purposes chemical activity ceases the cells of the body have developed a solution to this apparent problemthey are equipped with a huge array of enzymes enzymes are proteins which act as catalysts for biochemical reactions that is they speed the reaction up but are not themselves changed by it and therefore can be used over and over again enzymes are very selective and will usually catalyse only one specific reaction the molecules entering the reaction is called the substrate and it binds to a very specific site on the enzyme called the active site whilst the substrates is bound to the active site the reaction proceeds and once it is complete the products of the reaction breaks away from the enzyme and the active site is ready for use again fig 213 enzymes can catalyse both synthesis and breakdown reactions and their names almost always end in ase,biological molecules are vital for the structure and function of living organisms encompassing carbohydrates proteins lipids nucleotides and enzymes carbohydrates are organic compounds composed of carbon hydrogen and oxygen and are primarily classified as monosaccharides like glucose disaccharides like sucrose or polysaccharides like starch they serve as immediate energy sources are stored as glycogen in animals and form structural components in dna and rna amino acids are the building blocks of proteins containing carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen and sometimes sulfur the 20 common amino acids link through peptide bonds to form proteins which are essential for various biological functions including enzymatic reactions hormone signaling and immune responses lipids are hydrophobic molecules that include fats phospholipids and steroids they provide longterm energy storage contribute to cellular membrane structure and offer insulation and protection nucleotides make up nucleic acids like dna and rna each nucleotide consists of a sugar a phosphate group and a nitrogenous base dna carries genetic information while rna transmits this information to ribosomes for protein synthesis enzymes are specialized proteins that catalyze biochemical reactions enhancing reaction rates without being consumed
movement of substances within the body within the body it is essential that substances eg molecules electrolytes move around nutrients absorbed in the small intestine must move or they will never reach the tissues they are destined to nourish waste substances must travel from the tissues to their exit points from the body to enter the body from inhaled air oxygen gas must move across first the alveolar wall and then the wall of the capillary to get into the blood communication molecules such as hormones have to travel from the site of production to their destination water itself the principal constituent of the body has to move in order to be able to be distributed throughout the body fluids and keep solutes at appropriate physiological concentrations thus maintaining homeostasis from a physical point of view substances will always travel from an area of high concentration to one of low concentration assuming that there is no barrier in the way between two such areas there exists a concentration gradient and movement of substances occurs down the concentration gradient or downhill no energy is required for such movement this process is therefore described as passive net movement of substance high concentration low concentration there are many examples in the body of substances moving uphill ie against the concentration gradient in this case chemical energy is required usually in the form of atp these processes are described as active movement of substances across cell membranes by active transport is described on page 34 passive movement of substances in the body proceeds usually in one of two main ways diffusion or osmosis diffusion diffusion refers to the movement of a chemical substance from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration and occurs mainly in gases liquids and solutions this process enables the transfer of oxygen from the alveoli of the lungs high concentration through the alveolar and capillary walls into the blood low concentration sugar molecules heaped at the bottom of a cup of coffee which has not been stirred will in time become evenly distributed throughout the liquid by diffusion fig 214 the process of diffusion is speeded up if the temperature rises andor the concentration of the diffusing substance is increased diffusion can also occur across a semipermeable membrane such as the plasma membrane in this case only those molecules able to cross the membrane can diffuse through for example the capillary wall is effectively a semipermeable membrane whereas water can travel freely in either direction across it large proteins in the plasma and red blood cells are too large to cross and therefore remain in the blood osmosis osmosis is the movement of water down its concentration gradient across a semipermeable membrane when equilibrium cannot be achieved by diffusion of solute molecules this is usually because the solute molecules are too large to pass through the pores in the membrane the force with which this occurs is called the osmotic pressure water crosses the membrane down its concentration gradient from the side with the lower solute concentration to the side with the greater solute concentration this dilutes the more concentrated solution and concentrates the more dilute solution osmosis proceeds until equilibrium is reached at which point the solutions on each side of the membrane are of the same concentration and are said to be isotonic osmosis can be illustrated using the semipermeable membrane of the red blood cell as an example the concentration of water and solutes in the plasma is maintained within a very narrow range because if the plasma water concentration rises ie the plasma becomes more dilute than the intracellular fluid within the red blood cells then water will move down its concentration gradient across the membranes and into the red blood cells this may cause the red blood cells to swell and burst in this situation the plasma is said to be hypotonic conversely if the plasma water concentration falls so that the plasma becomes more concentrated than the intracellular fluid within the red blood cells the plasma becomes hipertonic water passively moves by osmosis from the blood cells into the plasma and shrinkage of the blood cells occurs fig 215 the total body water in adults of average build is about 60 of body weight this proportion is higher in young people and in adults below average weight it is lower in the elderly and in obesity in all age groups about 22 of body weight is extracellular water and about 38 is intracellular water fig 216 extracellular fluid the extracellular fluid ecf consists of blood plasma lymph cerebrospinal fluid and fluid in the interstitial spaces of the body interstitial or intercellular fluid tissue fluid bathes all the cells of the body except the outer layers of skin it is the medium through which substances pass from blood to the body cells and from the cells to blood every body cell in contact with the ecf is directly dependent upon the composition of that fluid for its wellbeing even slight changes can cause permanent damage and any change is therefore resisted by the body through one or more of its many control mechanisms this is homeostasis for example a fall in plasma calcium levels causes tetany abnormal spasmodic muscle contractions and convulsions fits because of increased excitability of muscle and nervous tissue rising blood calcium depresses muscle and nerve function and can even cause the heart to stop beating calcium levels in the ecf are only one of the many parameters under constant careful adjustment by the homeostatic mechanisms of the body intracellular fluid the composition of intracellular fluid icf is largely controlled by the cell itself because there are selective uptake and discharge mechanisms present in the cell membrane the composition of icf can therefore be very different from ecf thus sodium levels are nearly ten times higher in the ecf than in the icf this concentration difference occurs because although sodium diffuses into the cell down its concentration gradient there is a pump in the membrane which selectively pumps it back out again this concentration gradient is essential for the function of excitable cells mainly nerve and muscle conversely many substances are found inside the cell in significantly higher amounts than outside eg atp protein and potassium,the movement of substances such as nutrients and waste is crucial for maintaining bodily functions substances move through concentration gradients with the net flow occurring from areas of high concentration to low concentration a process known as diffusion this movement can occur passively without energy or actively requiring energy atp diffusion enables the transfer of molecules such as oxygen from the lungs to the bloodstream by moving from areas of higher concentration to lower concentration factors such as temperature and concentration gradients can speed up diffusion osmosis a specific type of diffusion refers to the movement of water across a semipermeable membrane from an area of lower solute concentration to one of higher concentration this process continues until equilibrium is achieved for example red blood cells can swell or shrink depending on the tonicity of the extracellular fluid ecf around themhypotonic solutions can cause swelling while hypertonic solutions lead to shrinkage the body maintains homeostasis ensuring stable internal conditions despite changes in the ecf and intracellular fluid icf composition these fluids are essential for nutrient transport waste removal and cellular function
the cell structure and functions the human body develops from a single cell called the zygote which results from the fusion of the ovum female egg cell and the spermatozoon male germ cell cell multiplication follows and as the fetus grows cells with different structural and functional specialisations develop all with the same genetic makeup as the zygote individual cells are too small to be seen with the naked eye however they can be seen when thin slices of tissue are stained in the laboratory and magnified by a microscope a cell consists of a plasma membrane inside which there are a number of organelles floating in a watery fluid called cytosol fig 31 organelles are small structures with highly specialised functions many of which are contained within a membrane they include the nucleus mitochondria ribosomes endoplasmic reticulum golgi apparatus lysosomes microfilaments and microtubules plasma membrane the plasma membrane fig 32 consists of two layers of phospholipids fatty substances p 24 with some protein molecules embedded in them those that extend all the way through the membrane may provide channels that allow the passage of for example electrolytes and nonlipidsoluble substances the phospholipid molecules have a head which is electrically charged and hydrophilic meaning water loving and a tail which has no charge and is hydrophobic meaning water hating the phospholipid bilayer is arranged like a sandwich with the hydrophilic heads aligned on the outer surfaces of the membrane and the hydrophobic tails forming a central waterrepelling layer these differences influence the transfer of substances across the membrane the membrane proteins perform several functions branched carbohydrate molecules attached to the outside of some membrane protein molecules give the cell its immunological identity they can act as specific receptors for hormones and other chemical messengers some are enzymes some are involved in transport across the membrane organelles nucleus every cell in the body has a nucleus with the exception of mature erythrocytes red blood cells skeletal muscle and some other cells contain several nuclei the nucleus is the largest organelle and is contained within a membrane similar to the plasma membrane but it has tiny pores through which some substances can pass between it and the cytoplasm ie the cell contents excluding the nucleus the nucleus contains the bodys genetic material which directs the activities of the cell this is built from dna p 24 and proteins called histones coiled together forming a fine network of threads called chromatin chromatin resembles tiny strings of beads during cell division the chromatin replicates and becomes more tightly coiled forming chromosomes fig 33 the functional subunits of chromosomes are called genes each cell contains the total complement of genes required to synthesise all the proteins in the body but most cells synthesise only the defined range of proteins that are appropriate to their own specialised functions this means that only part of the genome or genetic code is used by each cell metabolic processes occur in a series of steps each of which is catalysed by a specific enzyme p 26 and each enzyme can be produced only if the controlling gene is present this is the one gene one enzyme concept therefore when a gene is missing the associated enzyme is also missing and the chemical change it should catalyse does not occur fig 34 this means that the intermediate metabolite upon which the enzyme should act accumulates in physiological quantities such metabolites are harmless but when they accumulate they may become toxic there are a number of diseases caused by such inborn errors of metabolism eg phenylketonuria abnormal haemoglobin and some immune deficiencies see later chapters mitochondria mitochondria are sausageshaped structures in the cytoplasm sometimes described as the power house of the cell they are involved in aerobic respiration the processes by which chemical energy is made available in the cell this is in the form of atp which releases energy when the cell breaks it down see fig 212 p 25 synthesis of atp is most efficient in the final stages of aerobic respiration a process requiring oxygen p 315 ribosomes these are tiny granules composed of rna and protein they synthesise proteins from amino acids using rna as the template see fig 211 p 25 when present in free units or in small clusters in the cytoplasm the ribosomes make proteins for use within the cell ribosomes are also found on the outer surface of rough endoplasmic reticulum see below endoplasmic reticulum er endoplasmic reticulum is a series of interconnecting membranous canals in the cytoplasm there are two types smooth and rough smooth er synthesises lipids and steroid hormones and is also associated with the detoxification of some drugs rough er is studded with ribosomes these are the site of synthesis of proteins that are exported extruded from cells ie enzymes and hormones that pass out of their parent cell to be used by other cells in the body golgi apparatus the golgi apparatus consists of stacks of closely folded flattened membranous sacs it is present in all cells but is larger in those that synthesise and export proteins the proteins move from the endoplasmic reticulum to the golgi apparatus where they are packaged into membranebound vesicles called secretory granules the vesicles are stored and when needed move to the plasma membrane through which the proteins are exported lysosomes lysosomes are one type of secretory vesicle formed by the golgi apparatus they contain a variety of enzymes involved in breaking down fragments of organelles and large molecules eg rna dna carbohydrates proteins inside the cell into smaller particles that are either recycled or extruded from the cell as waste material lysosomes in white blood cells contain enzymes that digest foreign material such as microbes microfilaments and microtubules microfilaments these are tiny strands of protein that provide structural support and maintain the characteristic shape of the cell microtubules these are contractile protein structures in the cytoplasm involved in the movement of the cell and of organelles within the cell the movement of cilia small projections from the free border of some cells and possibly the organisation of proteins in the plasma membrane cell division there are two types of cell division mitosis and meiosis mitosis beginning with the fertilised egg or zygote cell division is an ongoing process as the fetus develops in the mothers uterus its cells multiply and grow into all the specialities that provide the sum total of the bodys physiological functions the life span of most individual cells is limited many become worn out and die and are replaced by identical cells by the process of mitosis mitosis occurs in two stages replication of dna in the form of 23 pairs of chromosomes then division of the cytoplasm dna is the only type of molecule capable of independently forming a duplicate of itself when the two identical sets of chromosomes have moved to the opposite poles of the parent cell a waist forms in the cytoplasm and the cell divides there is then a complete set of chromosomes in each daughter cell the organelles in the cytoplasm of the daughter cells are incomplete at cell division but they develop as the cell grows to maturity the frequency with which cell division occurs varies with different types of cell p 42 meiosis this is the process of cell division that occurs in the formation of reproductive cells gametes the ova and spermatozoa the ova grow to maturity in the ovaries of the female and the spermatozoa in the testes of the male in meiosis four daughter cells are formed after two divisions during meiosis the pairs of chromosomes separate and one from each pair moves to opposite poles of the parent cell when it divides each of the daughter cells has only 23 chromosomes called the haploid number this means that when the ovum is fertilised the resultant zygote has the full complement of 46 chomosomes the diploid number half from the father and half from the mother thus the child has some characteristics inherited from the mother and some from the father such as colour of hair and eyes height facial features and some diseases determination of sex depends upon one particular pair of chromosomes the sex chromosomes in the female both sex chromosomes are the same size and shape and are called x chromosomes in the male there is one x chromosome and a slightly smaller y chromosome when the ovum is fertilised by an xbearing spermatozoon the child is female and when it is fertilised by a ybearing spermatozoon the child is male,the human body originates from a single cell known as the zygote which forms when an ovum female egg fuses with a spermatozoon male germ cell this initial cell undergoes multiplication and differentiation leading to the development of various specialized cells all containing the same genetic material each cell is bounded by a plasma membrane that encases various organelles suspended in a fluid called cytosol key organelles include nucleus the largest organelle housing dna that directs cellular functions and contains genes essential for protein synthesis mitochondria referred to as the powerhouses of the cell they generate atp through aerobic respiration providing energy for cellular activities ribosomes small structures that synthesize proteins from amino acids using rna as a template endoplasmic reticulum er comprised of smooth lipid synthesis and rough protein synthesis types golgi apparatus packages proteins for secretion from the cell lysosomes contain digestive enzymes to break down waste and foreign materials cell division occurs via mitosis producing two identical cells and meiosis resulting in gametes with half the chromosome number critical for reproduction
transport of substances across cell membranes passive transport this occurs when substances can cross plasma and organelle semipermeable membranes and move down the concentration gradient downhill without using energy diffusion this was described on page 26 small substances diffuse down the concentration gradient crossing membranes by dissolving in the lipid part of the membrane eg lipidsoluble substances oxygen carbon dioxide fatty acids steroids passing through waterfilled channels or pores in the membrane eg small watersoluble substances sodium potassium calcium facilitated diffusion this passive process is utilised by some substances that are unable to diffuse through the semipermeable membrane unaided eg glucose amino acids specialised protein carrier molecules in the membrane have specific sites that attract and bind substances to be transferred like a lock and key mechanism the carrier then changes its shape and deposits the substance on the other side of the membrane fig 36 the carrier sites are specific and can be used by only one substance as there are a finite number of carriers there is a limit to the amount of a substance which can be transported at any time this is known as the transport maximum osmosis osmosis is passive movement of water down its concentration gradient towards equilibrium across a semipermeable membrane and is explained on page 27 active transport this is the transport of substances up their concentration gradient uphill ie from a lower to a higher concentration chemical energy in the form of atp p 25 drives specialised protein carrier molecules that transport substances across the membrane in either direction see fig 36 the carrier sites are specific and can be used by only one substance therefore the rate at which a substance is transferred depends on the number of sites available the sodium pump this active transport mechanism maintains homeostasis of the electrolytes sodium na and potassium k it may utilise up to 30 of the atp required for cellular metabolism the principal cations are k intracellularly and na extracellularly there is a tendency for these ions to diffuse down their concentration gradients k outwards and na into the cell homeostasis is maintained as excess na is pumped out across the cell membrane in exchange for k bulk transport transfer of particles too large to cross cell membranes occurs by pinocytosis or phagocytosis these particles are engulfed by extensions of the cytoplasm which enclose them forming a membranebound vacuole when the vacuole is small pinocytosis occurs in phagocytosis larger particles eg cell fragments foreign materials microbes are taken into the cell lysosomes then adhere to the vacuole membrane releasing enzymes which digest the contents extrusion of waste material by the reverse process through the plasma membrane is called exocytosis secretory granules formed by the golgi apparatus usually leave the cell in this way as do any indigestible residues of phagocytosis,the transport of substances across cell membranes is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis it can occur through passive and active transport mechanisms passive transport diffusion the movement of small substances across membranes down their concentration gradient without energy lipidsoluble substances eg oxygen carbon dioxide dissolve in the lipid layer while watersoluble substances eg sodium potassium pass through waterfilled pores facilitated diffusion this process involves specialized protein carriers that help larger molecules like glucose and amino acids cross the membrane the carriers operate on a lock and key mechanism limiting the transport rate to a transport maximum due to the finite number of carriers osmosis the passive movement of water down its concentration gradient through a semipermeable membrane seeking equilibrium active transport active transport moves substances against their concentration gradient using energy atp a key mechanism is the sodiumpotassium pump which maintains electrolyte balance by pumping sodium out of and potassium into cells consuming a significant portion of cellular atp bulk transport for larger particles that cannot pass through membranes pinocytosis cell drinking and phagocytosis cell eating occur where extensions of the cytoplasm engulf particles forming vacuoles waste is expelled via exocytosis allowing the cell to release substances like secretory granules
tissues the tissues of the body consist of large numbers of cells and they are classified according to the size shape and functions of these cells there are four main types of tissue each of which has subdivisions they are epithelial tissue or epithelium connective tissue muscle tissue nervous tissue epithelial tissue this group of tissues is found covering the body and lining cavities and tubes it is also found in glands the structure of epithelium is closely related to its functions which include protection of underlying structures from for example dehydration chemical and mechanical damage secretion absorption the cells are very closely packed and the intercellular substance called the matrix is minimal the cells usually lie on a basement membrane which is an inert connective tissue epithelial tissue may be simple a single layer of cells stratified several layers of cells simple epithelium simple epithelium consists of a single layer of identical cells and is divided into four types it is usually found on absorptive or secretory surfaces where the single layer enhances these processes and not usually on surfaces subject to stress the types are named according to the shape of the cells which differs according to their functions the more active the tissue the taller are the cells squamous pavement epithelium this is composed of a single layer of flattened cells fig 38 the cells fit closely together like flat stones forming a thin and very smooth membrane diffusion takes place freely through this thin smooth inactive lining of the following structures heart blood vessels lymph vessels alveoli of the lungs where it is also known as endothelium cuboidal cubical epithelium this consists of cubeshaped cells fitting closely together lying on a basement membrane fig 39 it forms the tubules of the kidneys and is found in some glands cuboidal epithelium is actively involved in secretion absorption and excretion columnar epithelium this is formed by a single layer of cells rectangular in shape on a basement membrane fig 310 it is found lining the organs of the alimentary tract and consists of a mixture of cells some absorb the products of digestion and others secrete mucus mucus is a thick sticky substance secreted by modified columnar cells called goblet cells ciliated epithelium fig 311 this is formed by columnar cells each of which has many fine hairlike processes called cilia the cilia consist of microtubules inside the plasma membrane that extends from the free border luminal border of the columnar cells the wavelike movement of many cilia propels the contents of the tubes which they line in one direction only ciliated epithelium is found lining the uterine tubes and most of the respiratory passages in the uterine tubes the cilia propel ova towards the uterus ch 19 and in the respiratory passages they propel mucus towards the throat ch 10 stratified epithelia stratified epithelia consist of several layers of cells of various shapes the superficial layers grow up from below basement membranes are usually absent the main function of stratified epithelium is to protect underlying structures from mechanical wear and tear there are two main types stratified squamous and transitional stratified squamous epithelium fig 312 this is composed of a number of layers of cells of different shapes representing newly formed and mature cells in the deepest layers the cells are mainly columnar and as they grow towards the surface they become flattened and are then shed nonkeratinised stratified epithelium this is found on wet surfaces that may be subjected to wear and tear but are protected from drying eg the conjunctiva of the eyes the lining of the mouth the pharynx the oesophagus and the vagina keratinised stratified epithelium this is found on dry surfaces that are subjected to wear and tear ie skin hair and nails the surface layer consists of dead epithelial cells to which the protein keratin has been added this forms a tough relatively waterproof protective layer that prevents drying of the underlying live cells the surface layer of skin is rubbed off and is replaced from below ch 14 transitional epithelium fig 313 this is composed of several layers of pearshaped cells and is found lining the urinary bladder it allows for stretching as the bladder fills,the human body is composed of various tissues classified based on cell size shape and function there are four main types of tissue epithelial connective muscle and nervous tissue epithelial tissue serves as a protective layer covering body surfaces and lining cavities it is essential for protection secretion and absorption featuring tightly packed cells with minimal intercellular substance on a basement membrane simple epithelium has a single layer of identical cells enhancing processes like absorption and secretion this includes squamous epithelium flattened cells allowing diffusion found in blood vessels and alveoli cuboidal epithelium cubeshaped cells involved in secretion and absorption in kidney tubules and glands columnar epithelium rectangular cells in the alimentary tract aiding absorption and mucus secretion via goblet cells ciliated epithelium columnar cells with cilia that help propel mucus in respiratory passages stratified epithelium consists of multiple layers providing protection against mechanical wear including stratified squamous epithelium varying cell shapes transitioning from columnar at the base to flattened at the surface found in the skin and mouth transitional epithelium layered pearshaped cells lining the urinary bladder accommodating stretching
connective tissue connective tissue is the most abundant tissue in the body the cells forming the connective tissues are more widely separated from each other than those forming the epithelium and intercellular substance matrix is present in considerably larger amounts there may or may not be fibres present in the matrix which may be of a semisolid jellylike consistency or dense and rigid depending upon the position and function of the tissue major functions of connective tissue are binding and structural support protection transport insulation cells of connective tissue connective tissue excluding blood ch 4 is found in all organs supporting the specialised tissue the different types of cell involved include fibroblasts fat cells macrophages leukocytes mast cells fibroblasts fibroblasts are large flat cells with irregular processes they produce collagen and elastic fibres and a matrix of extracellular material very fine collagen fibres sometimes called reticulin fibres are found in very active tissue such as the liver and lymphoid tissue fibroblasts are particularly active in tissue repair wound healing where they may bind together the cut surfaces of wounds or form granulation tissue following tissue destruction see p 367 the collagen fibres formed during healing shrink as they grow old sometimes interfering with the functions of the organ involved and with adjacent structures fat cells also known as adipocytes these cells occur singly or in groups in many types of connective tissue and are especially abundant in adipose tissue they vary in size and shape according to the amount of fat they contain macrophages these are irregularshaped cells with granules in the cytoplasm some are fixed ie attached to connective tissue fibres and others are motile they are an important part of the bodys defence mechanisms as they are actively phagocytic engulfing and digesting cell debris bacteria and other foreign bodies their activities are typical of those of the macrophagemonocyte defence system eg monocytes in blood phagocytes in the alveoli of the lungs kupffer cells in liver sinusoids fibroblasts in lymph nodes and spleen and microglial cells in the brain leukocytes white blood cells p 64 are normally found in small numbers in healthy connective tissue but migrate in significant numbers during infection when they play an important part in tissue defence lymphocytes synthesise and secrete specific antibodies into the blood in the presence of foreign material such as microbes ch 15 mast cells these cells are similar to basophil leukocytes see p 66 they are found in loose connective tissue and under the fibrous capsule of some organs eg liver and spleen and in considerable numbers round blood vessels they produce granules containing heparin histamine and other substances which are released when the cells are damaged by disease or injury histamine is involved in local and general inflammatory reactions it stimulates the secretion of gastric juice and is associated with the development of allergies and hypersensitivity states see p 383 heparin prevents coagulation of blood which may aid the passage of protective substances from blood to affected tissues loose areolar connective tissue fig 314 this is the most generalised of all connective tissue the matrix is described as semisolid with many fibroblasts and some fat cells mast cells and macrophages widely separated by elastic and collagen fibres it is found in almost every part of the body providing elasticity and tensile strength it connects and supports other tissues for example under the skin between muscles supporting blood vessels and nerves in the alimentary canal in glands supporting secretory cells adipose tissue fig 315 adipose tissue consists of fat cells adipocytes containing large fat globules in a matrix of areolar tissue there are two types white and brown white adipose tissue this makes up 20 to 25 of body weight in wellnourished adults the amount of adipose tissue in an individual is determined by the balance between energy intake and expenditure it is found supporting the kidneys and the eyes between muscle fibres and under the skin where it acts as a thermal insulator brown adipose tissue this is present in the newborn it has a more extensive capillary network than white adipose tissue when brown tissue is metabolised it produces less energy and considerably more heat than other fat contributing to the maintenance of body temperature in adults it is present in only small amounts dense connective tissue fibrous tissue fig 316 this tissue is made up mainly of closely packed bundles of collagen fibres with very little matrix fibrocytes old and inactive fibroblasts are few in number and are found lying in rows between the bundles of fibres fibrous tissue is found forming the ligaments which bind bones together as an outer protective covering for bone called periosteum as an outer protective covering of some organs eg the kidneys lymph nodes and the brain forming muscle sheaths called muscle fascia which extend beyond the muscle to become the tendon that attaches the muscle to bone elastic tissue fig 317 elastic tissue is capable of considerable extension and recoil there are few cells and the matrix consists mainly of masses of elastic fibres secreted by fibroblasts it is found in organs where alteration of shape is required eg in large blood vessel walls the epiglottis and the outer ears blood this is a fluid connective tissue and is described in detail in chapter 4 lymphoid tissue fig 318 this tissue has a semisolid matrix with fine branching reticulin fibres it contains white blood cells monocytes and lymphocytes they are found in blood and in lymphoid tissue in the lymph nodes spleen palatine and pharyngeal tonsils vermiform appendix solitary and aggregated nodes in the small intestine wall of the large intestine cartilage cartilage is a much firmer tissue than any of the other connective tissues the cells are called chondrocytes and are less numerous they are embedded in matrix reinforced by collagen and elastic fibres there are three types hyaline cartilage fibrocartilage elastic fibrocartilage hyaline cartilage fig 319 hyaline cartilage appears as a smooth bluishwhite tissue the chondrocytes are in small groups within cell nests and the matrix is solid and smooth hyaline cartilage is found on the surface of the parts of the bones that form joints forming the costal cartilages which attach the ribs to the sternum forming part of the larynx trachea and bronchi fibrocartilage fig 320 this consists of dense masses of white collagen fibres in a matrix similar to that of hyaline cartilage with the cells widely dispersed it is a tough slightly flexible tissue found as pads between the bodies of the vertebrae called the intervertebral discs between the articulating surfaces of the bones of the knee joint called semilunar cartilages on the rim of the bony sockets of the hip and shoulder joints deepening the cavities without restricting movement as ligaments joining bones elastic cartilage fig 321 this flexible tissue consists of yellow elastic fibres lying in a solid matrix the cells lie between the fibres it forms the pinna or lobe of the ear the epiglottis and part of the tunica media of blood vessel walls bone bone is a connective tissue with cells osteocytes surrounded by a matrix of collagen fibres that is strengthened by inorganic salts especially calcium and phosphate this provides bones with their characteristic strength and rigidity bone also has considerable capacity for growth in the first two decades of life and for regeneration throughout life two types of bone can be identified by the naked eye compact bone solid or dense appearance cancellous or spongy bone spongy or fine honeycomb appearance these are described in detail in chapter 16,connective tissue is the most abundant tissue type in the body characterized by widely spaced cells embedded in an extensive intercellular matrix this matrix can vary in consistency serving essential functions such as binding and structural support protection transport and insulation key cells within connective tissue include fibroblasts produce collagen and elastic fibers crucial for tissue repair adipocytes fat cells store fat and provide insulation and energy they exist as white energystoring and brown heatgenerating types macrophages irregularshaped immune cells that engulf debris and pathogens leukocytes white blood cells that migrate during infections to aid immune responses mast cells release substances like histamine and heparin involved in inflammatory responses types of connective tissue include loose connective tissue provides elasticity and support found beneath the skin dense connective tissue contains tightly packed collagen fibers forms tendons and ligaments cartilage firmer tissue that includes hyaline smooth joints fibrocartilage tough flexible and elastic cartilage flexible found in the ear bone a strong tissue with a mineralized matrix categorized as compact or cancellous spongy bone blood and lymphoid tissue fluid connective tissues involved in transport and immune functions
muscle tissue there are three types of muscle tissue which consists of specialised contractile cells skeletal muscle smooth muscle cardiac muscle skeletal muscle tissue fig 322 this may be described as skeletal striated striped or voluntary muscle it is called voluntary because contraction is under conscious control when skeletal muscle is examined microscopically the cells are found to be roughly cylindrical in shape and may be as long as 35 cm each cell commonly called a fibre has several nuclei situated just under the sarcolemma or cell membrane of each muscle fibre the muscle fibres lie parallel to one another and when viewed under the microscope they show wellmarked transverse dark and light bands hence the name striated or striped muscle sarcoplasm the cytoplasm of muscle fibres contains bundles of myofibrils which consist of filaments of contractile proteins including actin and myosin many mitochondria which generate chemical energy atp from glucose and oxygen by aerobic respiration glycogen a carbohydrate store which is broken down into glucose when required myoglobin a unique oxygenbinding protein molecule similar to haemoglobin in red blood cells which stores oxygen within muscle cells a myofibril has a repeating series of dark and light bands consisting of units called sarcomeres a sarcomere represents the smallest functional unit of a skeletal muscle fibre and consists of thin filaments of actin thick filaments of myosin the sliding filament theory explains the finding that sarcomeres shorten but the filaments remain the same length when skeletal muscle contracts the thin actin filaments slide past the thick myosin filaments increasing the overlap of the filaments when contraction takes place the movement of filaments occurs as chemical crossbridges are formed and broken moving the actin filaments towards the centre of the sarcomere during contraction as the sarcomeres shorten so does the skeletal muscle involved when the muscle relaxes the crossbridges break the filaments slide apart and the sarcomeres return to their original length fig 322c a muscle consists of a large number of muscle fibres in addition to the sarcolemma mentioned previously each fibre is enclosed in and attached to fine fibrous connective tissue called endomysium small bundles of fibres are enclosed in perimysium and the whole muscle in epimysium the fibrous tissue enclosing the fibres the bundles and the whole muscle extends beyond the muscle fibres to become the tendon which attaches the muscle to bone or skin smooth visceral muscle tissue fig 323 smooth muscle may also be described as nonstriated or involuntary it is not under conscious control it is found in the walls of hollow organs regulating the diameter of blood vessels and parts of the respiratory tract propelling contents of the ureters ducts of glands and alimentary tract expelling contents of the urinary bladder and uterus when examined under a microscope the cells are seen to be spindle shaped with only one central nucleus there is no distinct sarcolemma but a very fine membrane surrounds each fibre bundles of fibres form sheets of muscle such as those found in the walls of the above structures cardiac muscle tissue fig 324 this type of muscle tissue is found exclusively in the wall of the heart it is not under conscious control but when viewed under a microscope crossstripes characteristic of voluntary muscle can be seen each fibre cell has a nucleus and one or more branches the ends of the cells and their branches are in very close contact with the ends and branches of adjacent cells microscopically these joints or intercalated discs can be seen as lines which are thicker and darker than the ordinary crossstripes this arrangement gives cardiac muscle the appearance of a sheet of muscle rather than a very large number of individual fibres the endtoend continuity of cardiac muscle cells has significance in relation to the way the heart contracts a wave of contraction spreads from cell to cell across the intercalated discs which means that cells do not need to be stimulated individually function of muscle tissue muscle functions by alternate phases of contraction and relaxation when the fibres contract they become thicker and shorter skeletal muscle fibres are stimulated by motor nerve impulses originating in the brain or spinal cord p 151 and p 158 and ending at the neuromuscular junction p 145 smooth and cardiac muscle have the intrinsic ability to initiate contraction in addition contraction is stimulated by autonomic nerve impulses some hormones and local metabolites when muscle fibres contract they follow the all or none law ie each fibre contracts to its full capacity or not at all the strength of contraction eg lifting a weight depends on the number of fibres contracting at the same time when effort is sustained groups of fibres contract in series contraction of smooth muscle is slower and more sustained than skeletal muscle in order to contract when it is stimulated a muscle fibre must have an adequate blood supply to provide sufficient oxygen calcium and nutritional materials and to remove waste products muscle tone this is a state of partial contraction of muscles it is achieved by the contraction of a few muscle fibres at a time skeletal muscle tone is essential for maintenance of posture in the sitting and standing positions the muscle is stimulated to contract through a system of spinal reflexes stretching of a muscle or its tendon stimulates the reflex action ch 7 a degree of muscle tone is also maintained by smooth and cardiac muscle muscle fatigue if a muscle is stimulated to contract at very frequent intervals its response gradually becomes depressed and will in time cease fatigue is prevented during sustained muscular effort because the fibres usually contract in series all the fibres of a muscle rarely contract at the same time but if maximum effort is made it can be sustained if for only a short time energy source for muscle contraction the chemical energy atp which muscles require is usually derived from the breakdown catabolism of carbohydrate and fat protein molecules inside the fibres are used to provide energy when supplies of carbohydrate and fat are deficient each molecule undergoes a series of changes and with each change small quantities of energy are released for the complete breakdown of these molecules and the release of all the available energy an adequate supply of oxygen is required if the individual undertakes excessive exercise the oxygen supply may be insufficient to meet the metabolic needs of the muscle fibres this may result in the accumulation of intermediate metabolic products such as lactic acid where the breakdown process and the release of energy are complete the waste products are carbon dioxide and water ch 12 not all the chemical energy atp used by muscle fibres is converted into mechanical energy during contraction some is lost as heat further features of skeletal muscle the skeletal muscles are those which produce body movements each muscle consists of a fleshy part made up of striped fibres and tendinous parts consisting of fibrous tissue usually at both ends of the fleshy part the muscle is attached to bone or skin by these tendons when the tendinous attachment of a muscle is broad and flat it is called an aponeurosis to be able to produce movement at a joint a muscle or its tendon must stretch across the joint when a muscle contracts its fibres shorten and it pulls one bone towards another eg bending the elbow the muscles of the skeleton are arranged in groups some of which are antagonistic to each other to produce movement at a joint one muscle or group of muscles contracts while the antagonists relax eg to bend the knee the muscles on the back of the thigh contract and those on the front relax the constant adjustment of the contraction and relaxation of antagonistic groups of muscles is well demonstrated in the maintenance of balance and posture when sitting and standing these adjustments usually occur without conscious effort individual muscles and groups of muscles have been given names that reflect certain characteristics eg the shape of the muscle the trapezius is shaped like a trapezium the direction in which the fibres run the oblique muscles of the abdominal wall the position of the muscle the tibialis in the leg is associated with the tibia the movement produced by contraction of the muscle flexors extensors adductors the number of points of attachment of a muscle the biceps muscle has two tendons at one end the names of the bones to which the muscle is attached the carpi radialis muscles are attached to the carpal bones in the wrist and to the radius in the forearm a more detailed description of skeletal muscles is given in chapters 17 and 18,muscle tissue is specialized for contraction and movement with three main types skeletal smooth and cardiac muscle skeletal muscle this type of muscle is voluntary meaning it contracts under conscious control it is striated striped in appearance and consists of long cylindrical cells called fibers which contain multiple nuclei these fibers are made up of contractile proteins like actin and myosin organized into units called sarcomeres skeletal muscle is responsible for body movements posture and is attached to bones by tendons when a muscle contracts the actin filaments slide past the myosin filaments shortening the muscle smooth muscle found in the walls of hollow organs such as blood vessels the digestive tract and the bladder smooth muscle is involuntary and nonstriated it controls functions like blood vessel constriction and peristalsis in the digestive system smooth muscle contractions are slow and sustained cardiac muscle located only in the heart cardiac muscle is also involuntary but striated like skeletal muscle its fibers are interconnected by intercalated discs allowing for coordinated contractions necessary for pumping blood muscle contraction requires atp and oxygen and fatigue occurs when energy supplies are low muscles also maintain tone a partial contraction that supports posture
nervous tissue two types of tissue are found in the nervous system excitable cells these are called neurones and they initiate receive conduct and transmit information nonexcitable cells these support the neurones these are described in detail in chapter 7 tissue regeneration when tissue regeneration occurs it is essential that some of the original cells are available to replicate by mitosis the extent to which regeneration is possible depends on the normal rate of physiological turnover of particular types of cell those with a rapid turnover regenerate most effectively there are three types labile cells labile cells are those in which replication is normally a continuous process they include cells in epithelium of eg skin mucous membrane secretory glands ducts uterus lining bone marrow blood spleen and lymphoid tissue stable cells stable cells have retained the ability to replicate but do so infrequently they include liver kidney and pancreatic cells fibroblasts smooth muscle cells osteoblasts and osteoclasts in bone permanent cells permanent cells are unable to replicate after normal growth is complete they include nerve cells neurones skeletal and cardiac muscle membranes membranes are sheets of epithelial tissue and their supporting connective tissue that cover or line internal structures or cavities the main membranes are mucous serous synovial mucous membrane this is the moist lining of the alimentary tract respiratory tract and genitourinary tracts and is sometimes referred to as the mucosa the membrane consists of epithelial cells some of which produce a secretion called mucus a slimy tenacious fluid as it accumulates the cells become distended and finally burst discharging the mucus on to the free surface as the cells fill up with mucus they have the appearance of a goblet or flask and are known as goblet cells fig 325 organs lined by mucous membrane have a moist slippery surface mucus protects the lining membrane from mechanical and chemical injury and in the respiratory tract it traps inhaled foreign particles preventing them from entering the alveoli of the lungs serous membrane serous membranes or serosa secrete serous watery fluid they consist of a double layer of loose areolar connective tissue lined by simple squamous epithelium the parietal layer lines a cavity and the visceral layer surrounds organs within the cavity the two layers are separated by serous fluid secreted by the epithelium there are three sites where serous membranes are found the pleura lining the thoracic cavity and surrounding the lungs p 251 the pericardium lining the pericardial cavity and surrounding the heart p 83 the peritoneum lining the abdominal cavity and surrounding abdominal organs p 284 the serous fluid between the visceral and parietal layers enables an organ to glide freely within the cavity without being damaged by friction between it and adjacent organs for example the heart changes its shape and size during each beat and friction damage is prevented by the arrangement of pericardium and its serous fluid synovial membrane this membrane is found lining the joint cavities and surrounding tendons which could be injured by rubbing against bones eg over the wrist joint it is made up of a layer of fine flattened epithelial cells on a layer of delicate connective tissue synovial membrane secretes clear sticky oily synovial fluid which acts as a lubricant to the joints and helps to maintain their stability ch 17 glands glands are groups of epithelial cells which produce specialised secretions glands that discharge their secretion on to the epithelial surface of an organ either directly or through a duct are called exocrine glands exocrine glands vary considerably in size shape and complexity as shown in figure 326 other glands discharge their secretions into blood and lymph these are called endocrine glands ductless glands and their secretions are hormones see ch 9,nervous tissue is made up of two main types neurones which are excitable cells responsible for initiating and transmitting nerve impulses and nonexcitable cells which support neurones by maintaining the environment needed for their function tissue regeneration regeneration depends on the cell type labile cells eg skin blood mucous membranes replicate continuously aiding quick repair stable cells eg liver kidney smooth muscle replicate slowly and infrequently but can regenerate when needed permanent cells eg nerve skeletal cardiac muscle do not regenerate after growth leading to irreversible damage when injured membranes mucous membranes line internal structures like the respiratory and digestive tracts secreting mucus to protect tissues from damage and trap particles serous membranes are doublelayered structures found around organs like the lungs pleura heart pericardium and abdomen peritoneum they secrete serous fluid allowing smooth frictionfree movement of organs synovial membranes are found in joints secreting synovial fluid for lubrication and cushioning glands exocrine glands release secretions like mucus and enzymes onto surfaces while endocrine glands secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream to regulate body functions
organisation of the body anatomical terms the anatomical position this is the position assumed in all anatomical descriptions to ensure accuracy and consistency the body is in the upright position with the head facing forward the arms at the sides with the palms of the hands facing forward and the feet together median plane when the body in the anatomical position is divided longitudinally through the midline into right and left halves it has been divided in the median plane table 31 lists the paired directional terms used in anatomy the skeleton the skeleton is the bony framework of the body it forms the cavities and fossae that protect some structures forms the joints and gives attachment to muscles a detailed description of bones is given in chapter 16 table 32 lists the terminology related to the skeleton the skeleton is described in two parts axial and appendicular fig 327 the axial skeleton axis of the body consists of skull vertebral column sternum or breast bone ribs the appendicular skeleton appendages attached to the axis of the body consists of the bones of the upper limbs the two clavicles and the two scapulae the bones of the lower limbs and the two innominate bones of the pelvis axial skeleton skull the skull is described in two parts the cranium which contains the brain and the face it consists of a number of bones which develop separately but fuse together as they mature the only movable bone is the mandible or lower jaw the names and positions of the individual bones of the skull can be seen in figure 328 paired directional terms used in anatom directional terms in anatomy describe the position of structures relative to each other medial refers to a structure that is nearer to the midline of the body such as the heart being medial to the humerus conversely lateral means a structure is further from the midline or located on the side of the body like the humerus being lateral to the heart proximal indicates that a structure is nearer to the point of attachment of a limb or the origin of a body part as seen when the femur is proximal to the fibula on the other hand distal signifies that a structure is further from the point of attachment or origin like the fibula being distal to the femur when describing positions relative to the front or back of the body anterior or ventral refers to a structure being nearer to the front of the body such as the sternum being anterior to the vertebrae posterior or dorsal indicates a structure is nearer to the back of the body as in the vertebrae being posterior to the sternum in terms of vertical position superior refers to a structure being nearer the head like the skull being superior to the scapulae whereas inferior means a structure is further from the head such as the scapulae being inferior to the skull in the context of bone anatomy certain terms describe the nature of articulating surfaces and structures an articulating surface is the part of a bone that enters into the formation of a joint while an articulation refers to the joint itself between two or more bones a bony sinus is a hollow cavity within a bone a border describes a ridge of bone that separates two surfaces a condyle is a smooth rounded projection of bone that forms part of a joint and a facet is a smaller flatter articulating surface a fissure or cleft refers to a narrow slit while a foramen plural foramina is a hole in a structure a fossa plural fossae is a hollow or depression in a bone while a meatus refers to a tubeshaped cavity within a bone a septum is a partition separating two cavities a spine spinous process or crest refers to a sharp ridge of bone and a styloid process is a sharp downward projection of bone that provides attachment points for muscles and ligaments a suture is an immovable joint such as those found between the bones of the skull lastly trochanters tuberosities and tubercles refer to roughened bony projections that serve as attachment points for muscles or ligaments with trochanters being the largest and tubercles being the smallest functions of the skull the various parts of the skull have specific and different functions the cranium protects the delicate tissues of the brain the bony eye sockets provide the eyes with some protection against injury and give attachment to the muscles which move the eyes the temporal bone protects the delicate structures of the ear some bones of the face and the base of the skull give resonance to the voice because they have cavities called sinuses containing air the sinuses have tiny openings into the nasal cavity the bones of the face form the walls of the posterior part of the nasal cavities they keep the air passage open facilitating breathing the maxilla and the mandible provide alveolar ridges in which the teeth are embedded the mandible is the only movable bone of the skull and chewing food is the result of raising and lowering the mandible by contracting and relaxing some muscles of the face the muscles of mastication vertebral column this consists of 24 movable bones vertebrae plus the sacrum and coccyx the bodies of the bones are separated from each other by intervertebral discs consisting of cartilage the vertebral column is described in five parts and the bones of each part are numbered from above downwards figs 327 and 329 7 cervical 12 thoracic 5 lumbar 1 sacrum 5 fused bones 1 coccyx 4 fused bones the first cervical vertebra called the atlas articulates with the skull thereafter each vertebra forms a joint with the vertebrae immediately above and below in the cervical and lumbar regions more movement is possible than in the thoracic region the sacrum consists of five vertebrae fused into one bone which articulates with the fifth lumbar vertebra above the coccyx below and an innominate pelvic or hip bone at each side the coccyx consists of the four terminal vertebrae fused into a small triangular bone which articulates with the sacrum above functions of the vertebral column the vertebral column has several important functions it protects the spinal cord in each bone there is a hole or foramen and when the vertebrae are arranged one above the other as shown in figure 329 the foramina form a canal the spinal cord which is an extension of nerve tissue from the brain lies in this canal fig 330 adjacent vertebrae form openings intervertebral foramina through which spinal nerves pass from the spinal cord to all parts of the body fig 330 there are 31 pairs of spinal nerves in the thoracic region the ribs articulate with the vertebrae forming joints which move during respiration thoracic cage the thoracic cage is formed by 12 thoracic vertebrae 12 pairs of ribs 1 sternum or breast bone the arrangement of the bones can be seen in figure 331 functions of the thoracic cage the functions of the thoracic cage are as follows it protects the thoracic organs the bony framework protects the heart lungs large blood vessels and other structures it forms joints between the upper limbs and the axial skeleton the upper part of the sternum the manubrium articulates with the clavicles forming the only joints between the upper limbs and the axial skeleton it gives attachment to the muscles of respiration intercostal muscles occupy the spaces between the ribs and when they contract the ribs move upwards and outwards increasing the capacity of the thoracic cage and inspiration breathing in occurs the diaphragm is a domeshaped muscle which separates the thoracic and abdominal cavities it is attached to the bones of the thorax and when it contracts it assists with inspiration structures which extend from one cavity to the other pass through the diaphragm it enables breathing ventilation to take place appendicular skeleton the appendages are the upper limbs and the shoulder girdles the lower limbs and the innominate bones of the pelvis the names of the bones involved their position and their relationship to other bones are shown in figure 327 functions of the appendicular skeleton the appendicular skeleton has two functions voluntary movement the bones muscles and joints of the limbs are involved in voluntary movement this may range from the very fine movements of the fingers associated with writing to the coordinated movement of all the limbs associated with running and jumping protection of delicate structures structures such as blood vessels and nerves lie along the length of bones of the limbs and are protected from injury by the muscles and skin these structures are most vulnerable where they cross joints and where bones can be felt near the skin,the human body is organized into two main parts the axial skeleton and the appendicular skeleton the axial skeleton includes the skull vertebral column sternum and ribs the skull is divided into the cranium which protects the brain and the face which helps in breathing and chewing the skull also houses the sense organs and is largely immobile except for the mandible which allows for movement during chewing the vertebral column consists of 24 vertebrae plus the sacrum and coccyx protecting the spinal cord and providing flexibility the thoracic cage composed of 12 ribs and the sternum protects vital organs like the heart and lungs and assists in breathing by allowing expansion of the chest the appendicular skeleton includes the bones of the limbs and girdles it enables voluntary movement such as walking and fine motor skills like writing and also protects delicate structures like nerves and blood vessels particularly where bones are close to the skin or joints directional terms such as medial lateral anterior and posterior are used to describe the relative positions of body parts ensuring clear and consistent anatomical descriptions
cavities of the body the organs that make up the systems of the body are contained in four cavities m cranial thoracic abdominal pelvic cranial cavity the cranial cavity contains the brain and its boundaries are formed by the bones of the skull fig 332 anteriorly frontal bone laterally 2 temporal bones posteriorly i occipital bone superiorly 2 parietal bones inferiorly i sphenoid and 1 ethmoid bone and parts of the frontal temporal and occipital bones thoracic cavity this cavity is situated in the upper part of the trunk its boundaries are formed by a bony framework and supporting muscles fig 333 anteriorly the sternum and costal cartilages of the ribs laterally 12 pairs of ribs and the intercostal muscles posteriorly the thoracic vertebrae and the intervertebral discs between the bodies of the vertebrae superiorly the structures forming the root of the neck inferiorly the diaphragm a domeshaped muscle contents the main organs and structures contained in the thoracic cavity are fig 334 the trachea 2 bronchi 2 lungs the heart aorta superior and inferior vena cava numerous other blood vessels the oesophagus lymph vessels and lymph nodes nerves the mediastinum is the name given to the space between the lungs including the structures found there such as the heart oesophagus and blood vessels abdominal cavity this is the largest cavity in the body and is oval in shape figs 335 and 336 it is situated in the main part of the trunk and its boundaries are superiorly the diaphragm which separates it from the thoracic cavity anteriorly the muscles forming the anterior abdominal wall posteriorly the lumbar vertebrae and muscles forming the posterior abdominal wall laterally the lower ribs and parts of the muscles of the abdominal wall inferiorly the pelvic cavity with which it is continuous by convention the abdominal cavity is divided into the nine regions shown in figure 337 this facilitates the description of the positions of the organs and structures it contains contents most of the space in the abdominal cavity is occupied by the organs and glands involved in the digestion and absorption of food figs 335 and 336 these are the stomach small intestine and most of the large intestine the liver gall bladder bile ducts and pancreas other structures include the spleen 2 kidneys and the upper part of the ureters 2 adrenal suprarenal glands numerous blood vessels lymph vessels nerves lymph nodes pelvic cavity the pelvic cavity is roughly funnel shaped and extends from the lower end of the abdominal cavity figs 338 and 339 the boundaries are superiorly it is continuous with the abdominal cavity anteriorly the pubic bones posteriorly the sacrum and coccyx laterally the innominate bones inferiorly the muscles of the pelvic floor contents the pelvic cavity contains the following structures sigmoid colon rectum and anus some loops of the small intestine urinary bladder lower parts of the ureters and the urethra in the female the organs of the reproductive system the uterus uterine tubes ovaries and vagina fig 338 in the male some of the organs of the reproductive system the prostate gland seminal vesicles spermatic cords deferent ducts vas deferens ejaculatory ducts and the urethra common to the reproductive and urinary systems fig 339,the body contains four main cavities that house and protect essential organs cranial cavity encloses the brain and is formed by the skull bones including the frontal temporal occipital parietal sphenoid and ethmoid bones thoracic cavity located in the upper trunk its boundaries are the sternum ribs vertebrae and diaphragm it contains the lungs heart trachea esophagus and major blood vessels like the aorta and vena cava the mediastinum is the central space between the lungs containing the heart and other structures abdominal cavity the largest cavity located in the main trunk houses organs involved in digestion including the stomach small intestine large intestine liver gallbladder and pancreas it also contains the spleen kidneys and adrenal glands pelvic cavity this funnelshaped cavity is continuous with the abdominal cavity it contains parts of the digestive system such as the rectum and sigmoid colon the urinary bladder and reproductive organs in females it includes the uterus ovaries and vagina in males the prostate seminal vesicles and associated ducts
neoplasms or tumours a tumour or neoplasm literally meaning new growth is a mass of tissue that grows faster than normal in an uncoordinated manner and continues to grow after the initial stimulus has ceased tumours are classified as benign or malignant although a clear distinction is not always possible see table 33 benign tumours only rarely change their character and become malignant causes of neoplasms some factors are known to precipitate the changes found in tumour cells but the reasons for the uncontrolled cell multiplication are not known the process of change is carcinogenesis and the agents precipitating the change are carcinogens carcinogenesis may be of genetic andor environmental origin and a clearcut distinction is not always possible carcinogens environmental agents known to cause malignant changes in cells do so by progressive irreversible disorganisation and modification of the chromosomes and genes it is impossible to specify a maximum safe dose of a carcinogen a small dose may initiate change but this may not be enough to cause malignancy unless there are repeated doses within a limited period of time that have a cumulative effect in addition there are widely varying latent periods between exposure and evidence of malignancy there may also be other unknown factors environmental carcinogens include chemicals irradiations and oncogenic viruses chemical carcinogens some chemicals are carcinogens when absorbed others are modified after absorption and become carcinogenic some known chemical carcinogens are aniline dyes arsenic compounds asbestos benzene derivatives cigarette smoke nickel compounds some fuel oils vinyl chloride radiation carcinogens exposure to ionising radiation including xrays radioactive isotopes environmental radiations and ultraviolet rays in sunlight may cause malignant changes in some cells and kill others the cells are affected during mitosis so those normally undergoing continuous controlled division are most susceptible these labile tissues include skin mucous membrane bone marrow lymphoid tissue and gametes in the ovaries and testes oncogenic viruses viruses some consisting of dna and some of rna are known to cause malignant changes in animals and there are indications of similar involvement in humans viruses enter cells and the addition of dna or rna to the host cells nucleus causes mutation the mutant cells may be malignant host factors internal body factors of the host can influence susceptibility to tumours these include race diet age inherited factors tumours of individual structures are described in the appropriate chapters growth of tumours normally cells divide in an orderly manner neoplastic cells have escaped from the normal controls and they multiply in a disorderly manner forming a tumour blood vessels grow with the proliferating cells but in some malignant tumours the blood supply does not keep pace with growth and ischaemia lack of blood supply leads to tumour cell death called necrosis if the tumour is near the surface this may result in skin ulceration and infection in deeper tissues there is fibrosis eg retraction of the nipple in breast cancer is due to the shrinkage of fibrous tissue in a necrotic tumour the mechanisms controlling the life span of tumour cells are poorly understood cell differentiation differentiation of cells into types with particular structural and functional characteristics occurs at an early stage in fetal development eg epithelial cells develop different characteristics from lymphocytes later when cell replacement occurs daughter cells have the same appearance functions and genetic makeup as the parent cell in benign tumours the cells from which they originate are easily recognised ie tumour cells are well differentiated tumours with welldifferentiated cells are usually benign but some may be malignant malignant tumours grow beyond their normal boundaries and show varying levels of differentiation mild dysplasia this means the tumour cells have retained most of their normal features and their parent cells can usually be identified anaplasia this means the tumour cells have lost most of their normal features and their parent cells cannot be identified encapsulation and spread of tumours most benign tumours are contained within a fibrous capsule derived partly from the surrounding tissues and partly from the tumour they neither infiltrate local tissues nor spread to other parts of the body even when they are not encapsulated malignant tumours are not encapsulated they spread locally by infiltration and tumour fragments may spread to other parts of the body in blood or lymph some spreading cells may be phagocytosed but others lodge in tissues away from the primary site and grow into secondary tumours metastases local spread benign tumours enlarge and may cause pressure damage to local structures they do not spread to other parts of the body benign or malignant tumours may damage nerves causing pain and loss of nerve control of other tissues and organs supplied by the damaged nerves compress adjacent structures causing eg ischaemia lack of blood necrosis death of tissue blockage of ducts organ dysfunction or displacement or pain due to pressure on nerves additionally malignant tumours grow into and infiltrate surrounding tissues and they may erode blood and lymph vessel walls causing spread of tumour cells to other parts of the body lymphatic spread this occurs when malignant tumours grow into lymph vessels groups of tumour cells break off and are carried to lymph nodes where they lodge and may grow into secondary tumours there may be further spread through the lymphatic system and to blood because lymph eventually enters the subclavian veins blood spread this occurs when the walls of a blood vessel are eroded by a malignant tumour a thrombus blood clot may form at the site and emboli consisting of fragments of tumour and blood clot enter the bloodstream these emboli block small blood vessels cause infarcts areas of dead tissue and metastatic tumours develop phagocytosis of tumour cells in the emboli is unlikely to occur because these are protected by the blood clot single tumour cells can also lodge in the capillaries of other body organs division and subsequent growth of secondary tumours or metastases may then occur the sites of bloodspread metastases depend on the site of the original tumour and the anatomy of the circulatory system although the reasons why some organs develop metastases more frequently than others are not always clear body cavities spread this occurs when a tumour penetrates the wall of a cavity the peritoneal cavity is most frequently involved if for example a malignant tumour in an abdominal organ penetrates the visceral peritoneum tumour cells may metastasise to folds of peritoneum or any abdominal or pelvic organ where there is less scope for the movement of fragments within a cavity the tumour tends to bind layers of tissue together eg a pleural tumour binds the visceral and parietal layers together limiting expansion of the lung table 34 shows common sites of primary tumours and their metastases effects of tumours pressure effects both benign and malignant tumours may cause pressure damage to adjacent structures especially if in a confined space the effects depend on the site of the tumour but are most marked in areas where there is little space for expansion eg inside the skull under the periosteum of bones in bony sinuses and respiratory passages compression of adjacent structures may cause ischaemia necrosis blockage of ducts organ dysfunction or displacement pain due to invasion of nerves or pressure on nerves hormonal effects tumours of endocrine glands may secrete hormones producing the effects of hypersecretion the extent of cell dysplasia is an important factor welldifferentiated benign tumours are more likely to secrete hormones than are markedly dysplastic malignant tumours high levels of hormones are found in the bloodstream as secretion occurs in the absence of the normal stimulus and homeostatic control mechanism some malignant tumours produce uncharacteristic hormones the cells of the tumour do not appear to originate from the appropriate endocrine gland there is evidence of this phenomenon but the reasons for it are unclear endocrine glands may be destroyed by invading tumours causing hormone deficiency cachexia this is the severe weight loss accompanied by progressive weakness loss of appetite wasting and anaemia that is usually associated with advanced cancer the severity is usually indicative of the stage of development of the disease the causes are not clear,a tumor or neoplasm is an abnormal mass of tissue that grows uncontrollably and independently of normal stimuli tumors are classified as benign noncancerous or malignant cancerous carcinogenesis is the process by which normal cells transform into cancerous ones often triggered by carcinogens eg chemicals radiation or viruses benign tumors typically do not spread or invade other tissues while malignant tumors infiltrate surrounding tissues and spread through lymphatic blood or body cavities forming metastases malignant tumors disrupt normal functions by causing pressure effects hormonal imbalances and cachexia severe weight loss and weakness radiation and chemical carcinogens can damage cells leading to uncontrolled growth the spread of malignant cells can occur locally through the bloodstream or lymphatic system with secondary tumors potentially forming in distant organs key concepts include cell differentiation where tumor cells may lose their normal characteristics and necrosis where tumor cells die due to inadequate blood supply host factors like race age and genetics also affect tumor development
the blood blood is a connective tissue it provides one of the means of communication between the cells of different parts of the body and the external environment eg it carries oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs for excretion nutrients from the alimentary tract to the tissues and cell wastes to the excretory organs principally the kidneys hormones secreted by endocrine glands to their target glands and tissues heat produced in active tissues to other less active tissues protective substances eg antibodies to areas of infection clotting factors that coagulate blood minimising its loss from ruptured blood vessels blood makes up about 7 of body weight about 56 litres in a 70 kg man this proportion is less in women and considerably greater in children gradually decreasing until the adult level is reached blood in the blood vessels is always in motion the continual flow maintains a fairly constant environment for the body cells blood volume and the concentration of its many constituents are kept within narrow limits by homeostatic mechanisms composition of blood blood is composed of a strawcoloured transparent fluid plasma in which different types of cells are suspended plasma constitutes about 55 and cells about 45 of blood volume fig 41 a plasma the constituents of plasma are water 90 to 92 and dissolved substances including plasma proteins albumins globulins including antibodies fibrinogen clotting factors inorganic salts mineral salts sodium chloride sodium bicarbonate potassium magnesium phosphate iron calcium copper iodine cobalt nutrients principally from digested foods eg monosaccharides mainly glucose amino acids fatty acids glycerol and vitamins organic waste materials eg urea uric acid creatinine hormones enzymes eg certain clotting factors gases eg oxygen carbon dioxide nitrogen plasma proteins plasma proteins which make up about 7 of plasma are normally retained within the blood because they are too big to escape through the capillary pores into the tissues they are largely responsible for creating the osmotic pressure of blood normally 25 mmhg or 33 kpa which keeps plasma fluid within the circulation if plasma protein levels fall because of either reduced production or loss from the blood vessels osmotic pressure is also reduced and fluid moves into the tissues oedema and body cavities albumins these are formed in the liver they are the most abundant plasma proteins and their main function is to maintain a normal plasma osmotic pressure albumins also act as carrier molecules for lipids and steroid hormones globulins most are formed in the liver and the remainder in lymphoid tissue their main functions are as antibodies immunoglobulins which are complex proteins produced by lymphocytes that play an important part in immunity they bind to and neutralise foreign materials antigens such as microorganisms see also p 380 transportation of some hormones and mineral salts eg thyroglobulin carries the hormone thyroxine and transferrin carries the mineral iron inhibition of some proteolytic enzymes eg 2 macroglobulin inhibits trypsin activity clotting factors these are substances essential for coagulation of blood p 67 serum is plasma from which clotting factors have been removed fig 41b fibrinogen this is synthesised in the liver and is essential for blood coagulation plasma viscosity thickness is due to plasma proteins mainly albumin and fibrinogen viscosity is used as a measure of the bodys response to some diseases inorganic salts mineral salts these are involved in a wide variety of activities including cell formation contraction of muscles transmission of nerve impulses formation of secretions and maintenance of the balance between acids and alkalis in health the blood is slightly alkaline alkalinity and acidity are expressed in terms of ph which is a measure of hydrogen ion concentration or h p 21 and fig 26 the ph of blood is maintained between 735 and 745 by an ongoing complicated series of chemical activities involving buffering systems nutrients food is digested in the alimentary tract and the resultant nutrients are absorbed eg monosaccharides amino acids fatty acids glycerol and vitamins together with mineral salts they are required by all body cells to provide energy heat materials for repair and replacement and for the synthesis of other blood components and body secretions organic waste products urea creatinine and uric acid are the waste products of protein metabolism they are formed in the liver and conveyed in blood to the kidneys for excretion carbon dioxide released by all cells is conveyed to the lungs for excretion hormones ch 8 these are chemical compounds synthesised by endocrine glands hormones pass directly from the cells of the glands into the blood which transports them to their target tissues and organs elsewhere in the body where they influence cellular activity gases oxygen carbon dioxide and nitrogen are transported round the body in solution in plasma oxygen and carbon dioxide are also transported in combination with haemoglobin in red blood cells p 256 most oxygen is carried in combination with haemoglobin and most carbon dioxide as bicarbonate ions dissolved in plasma atmospheric nitrogen enters the body in the same way as other gases and is present in plasma but it has no physiological function p 255,blood is a vital connective tissue that plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis and facilitating communication within the body comprising approximately 7 of body weight blood consists of plasma 55 and various types of cells 45 plasma is a strawcolored fluid composed of 9092 water and contains essential components such as plasma proteins nutrients hormones gases and waste products the main plasma proteins include albumins which help maintain osmotic pressure and globulins which function in immune response by neutralizing foreign invaders blood is responsible for transporting oxygen from the lungs to body tissues and carrying carbon dioxide from tissues back to the lungs for excretion it also delivers nutrients absorbed from the digestive tract hormones from endocrine glands and waste products like urea to the kidneys for elimination additionally bloods ph is slightly alkaline ranging from 735 to 745 which is essential for optimal cellular function the inorganic salts in blood are crucial for processes such as muscle contraction and nerve transmission overall blood plays an indispensable role in sustaining life by facilitating the exchange of substances necessary for cellular health
cellular content of blood there are three types of blood cells see fig 15 p 8 erythrocytes or red cells thrombocytes or platelets leukocytes or white cells all blood cells originate from pluripotent stem cells and go through several developmental stages before entering the blood different types of blood cells follow separate lines of development the process of blood cell formation is called haemopoiesis fig 42 and takes place within red bone marrow for the first few years of life red marrow occupies the entire bone capacity and over the next 20 years is gradually replaced by fatty yellow marrow that has no erythropoietic function in adults erythropoiesis is confined to flat bones irregular bones and the ends epiphyses of long bones the main sites being the sternum ribs pelvis and skull erythrocytes red blood cells these are circular biconcave nonnucleated discs with a diameter of about 7 microns measurements of red cell numbers volume and haemoglobin content are routine and useful assessments made in clinical practice table 41 the symbols in brackets are the abbreviations commonly used in laboratory reports erythrocyte count this is the number of erythrocytes per litre 1 or per cubic millimetre mm3 of blood packed cell volume or haematocrit this is the volume of red cells in 1 litre or 1 mm3 of whole blood mean cell volume this is the average volume of cells measured in femtolitres fl 10115 litre haemoglobin this is the weight of haemoglobin in whole blood measured in grams per 100 ml mean cell haemoglobin this is the average amount of haemoglobin in each cell measured in picograms pg 10112 gram mean cell haemoglobin concentration this is the amount of haemoglobin in 100 ml of red cells development and life span of erythrocytes erythrocytes are formed in red bone marrow which is present in the ends of long bones and in flat and irregular bones they pass through several stages of development before entering the blood their life span in the circulation is about 120 days the process of development of red blood cells from pluripotent stem cells takes about 7 days and is called erythropoiesis fig 42 it is characterised by two main features maturation of the cell formation of haemoglobin inside the cell fig 43 maturation of the cell during this process the cell decreases in size and loses its nucleus these changes depend on a number of factors especially the presence of vitamin b12 and folic acid these are present in sufficient quantity in a normal diet containing dairy products meat and green vegetables if the diet contains more than is needed they are stored in the liver absorption of vitamin b12 depends on a glycoprotein called intrinsic factor secreted by parietal cells in the gastric glands together they form the intrinsic factorvitamin bu complex ifb12 during its passage through the intestines the bound vitamin is protected from enzymatic digestion and is absorbed in the terminal ileum the effects of deficient intake of vitamin b12 do not appear for several years because there are large stores in the liver folic acid is absorbed in the duodenum and jejunum where it undergoes change before entering the blood signs of deficiency are apparent within a few months deficiency of either vitamin b12 or folic acid leads to impaired red cell production formation of haemoglobin haemoglobin is a complex protein consisting of globin and an ironcontaining substance called haem and is synthesised inside developing erythrocytes in red bone marrow haemoglobin in mature erythrocytes combines with oxygen to form oxyhaemoglobin giving arterial blood its characteristic red colour in this way the bulk of oxygen absorbed from the lungs is transported around the body to maintain a continuous oxygen supply to all cells haemoglobin is also involved to a lesser extent in the transport of carbon dioxide from the body cells to the lungs for excretion each haemoglobin molecule contains four atoms of iron each atom can carry one molecule of oxygen therefore one haemoglobin molecule can carry up to four molecules of oxygen haemoglobin is said to be saturated when all its available binding sites for oxygen are filled when oxygen levels are low only partial saturation is possible control of erythropoiesis the number of red cells remains fairly constant which means that the bone marrow produces erythrocytes at the rate at which they are destroyed this is due to a homeostatic negative feedback mechanism fig 44 the primary stimulus to increased erythropoiesis is hypoxia ie deficient oxygen supply to body cells this occurs when the oxygencarrying power of blood is reduced by eg haemorrhage or excessive erythrocyte breakdown haemolysis due to disease the oxygen tension in the air is reduced as at high altitudes hypoxia increases erythrocyte formation by stimulating the production of the hormone erythropoietin mainly by the kidneys erythropoietin stimulates an increase in the production of proerythroblasts and the release of increased numbers of reticulocytes into the blood these changes increase the oxygencarrying capacity of the blood and reverse tissue hypoxia the original stimulus when the tissue hypoxia is overcome erythropoietin production declines fig 44 when erythropoietin levels are low red cell formation does not take place even in the presence of hypoxia and anaemia the inability of the blood to carry adequate oxygen for body needs develops it is believed that erythropoietin regulates normal red cell replacement ie in the absence of hypoxia destruction of erythrocytes the life span of erythrocytes is about 120 days and their breakdown or haemolysis is carried out by phagocytic reticuloendothelial cells these cells are found in many tissues but the main sites of haemolysis are the spleen bone marrow and liver as erythrocytes age changes in their cell membranes make them more susceptible to haemolysis iron released by haemolysis is retained in the body and reused in the bone marrow to form haemoglobin fig 43 biliverdin is formed from the protein part of the erythrocytes it is almost completely reduced to the yellow pigment bilirubin before it is bound to plasma globulin and transported to the liver see fig 1241 p 310 in the liver it is changed from a fatsoluble to a watersoluble form before it is excreted as a constituent of bile blood groups individuals have different types of antigen on the surfaces of their red blood cells these antigens which are inherited determine the individuals blood group in addition individuals make antibodies to these antigens but not to their own type of antigen since if they did the antigens and antibodies would react causing a transfusion reaction the main signs are clumping of red blood cells haemolysis shock and kidney failure these antibodies circulate in the bloodstream and the ability to make them like the antigens is genetically determined and not associated with acquired immunity see also ch 15 if individuals are transfused with blood of the same group ie possessing the same antigens on the surface of the cells their immune system will not recognise them as foreign and will not reject them however if they are given blood from an individual of a different blood type ie with a different type of antigen on the red cells their immune system will mount an attack upon them and destroy the transfused cells this is the basis of the transfusion reaction the two blood types the donor and the recipient are incompatible there are many different collections of red cell surface antigens but the most important are the abo and the rhesus systems the abo system about 55 of the population has either atype antigens blood group a btype antigens blood group b or both blood group ab on their red cell surface the remaining 45 have neither a nor b type antigens blood group o the corresponding antibodies are called antia and antib blood group a individuals cannot make antia and therefore do not have these antibodies in their plasma since otherwise a reaction to their own cells would occur they do however make antib blood group b individuals for the same reasons make only antia blood group ab make neither and blood group o make both antia and antib fig 45 because blood group ab people make neither antia nor antib antibodies they are known as universal recipients transfusion of either type a or type b blood into these individuals is safe since there are no antibodies to react with them conversely group o people have neither a nor b antigens on their red cell membranes and their blood may be safely transfused into a b ab or o types group o is known as the universal donor the rhesus system the red blood cell membrane antigen important here is the rhesus rh antigen or rhesus factor about 85 of people have this antigen they are rhesus positive rh and do not therefore make antirhesus antibodies the remaining 15 have no rhesus antigen they are rhesus negative or rh rh individuals are capable of making antirhesus antibodies but are stimulated to do so only in certain circumstances eg in pregnancy p 71 or as the result of an incompatible blood transfusion,blood consists of three main types of cells erythrocytes red blood cells thrombocytes platelets and leukocytes white blood cells these cells originate from pluripotent stem cells in the red bone marrow through a process called haemopoiesis which occurs primarily in flat and irregular bones like the sternum pelvis and ribs in adults erythrocytes are biconcave nonnucleated discs responsible for transporting oxygen via haemoglobin a protein that binds to oxygen erythropoiesis the formation of red cells takes about seven days and is influenced by the presence of vitamin b12 and folic acid red cells live for about 120 days and are eventually broken down by the spleen bone marrow and liver with iron being recycled for further use blood grouping is determined by surface antigens on red blood cells the abo system classifies individuals into groups a b ab or o based on the presence or absence of a and b antigens the rhesus rh factor further divides blood into rhpositive or rhnegative types incompatible blood transfusions can lead to severe reactions like haemolysis shock or kidney failure due to immune responses against foreign blood cells
leukocytes white blood cells these cells have an important function in defending the body against microbes and other foreign materials leukocytes are the largest blood cells and they account for about 1 of the blood volume they contain nuclei and some have granules in their cytoplasm there are two main types table 42 granulocytes polymorphonuclear leukocytes neutrophils eosinophils and basophils agranulocytes monocytes and lymphocytes granulocytes polymorphonuclear leukocytes during their formation granulopoiesis they follow a common line of development through myeloblast to myelocyte before differentiating into the three types figs 42 and 46 all granulocytes have multilobed nuclei in their cytoplasm their names represent the dyes they take up when stained in the laboratory eosinophils take up the red acid dye eosin basophils take up alkaline methylene blue and neutrophils are purple because they take up both dyes neutrophils their main function is to protect against any foreign material that gains entry to the body mainly microbes and to remove waste materials eg cell debris they are attracted in large numbers to any area of infection by chemical substances released by damaged cells called chemotaxins neutrophils pass through the capillary walls in the affected area by amoeboid movement fig 47 thereafter they engulf and kill the microbes by phagocytosis fig 48 their granules are lysosomes that contain enzymes that digest the engulfed material the pus that may form in the affected area consists of dead tissue cells dead and live microbes and phagocytes killed by microbes there is a physiological increase in circulating neutrophils following strenuous exercise and in the later stages of normal pregnancy numbers are also increased in microbial infection tissue damage eg inflammation myocardial infarction burns crush injuries metabolic disorders eg diabetic ketoacidosis acute gout leukaemia heavy smoking use of oral contraceptives eosinophils eosinophils although capable of phagocytosis are less active in this than neutrophils their specialised role appears to be in the elimination of parasites such as worms which are too big to be phagocytosed they are equipped with certain toxic chemicals stored in their granules which they release when the eosinophil binds an infecting organism eosinophils are often found at sites of allergic inflammation such as the asthmatic airway and skin allergies there they promote tissue inflammation by releasing their array of toxic chemicals but they may also dampen down the inflammatory process through the release of other chemicals such as an enzyme that breaks down histamine p 376 basophils basophils which are closely associated with allergic reactions contain cytoplasmic granules packed with heparin an anticoagulant histamine an inflammatory agent and other substances that promote inflammation usually the stimulus that causes basophils to release the contents of their granules is an allergen an antigen that causes allergy of some type this binds to antibodytype receptors on the basophil membrane a cell type very similar to basophils except that it is found in the tissues not in the circulation is the mast cell mast cells release their granule contents within seconds of binding an allergen which accounts for the rapid onset of allergic symptoms following exposure to for example pollen in hay fever agranulocytes the types of leukocyte with a large nucleus and no granules in their cytoplasm are monocytes and lymphocytes and they make up 25 to 50 of all leukocytes figs 42 and 49 monocytes these are large mononuclear cells that originate in red bone marrow some circulate in the blood and are actively motile and phagocytic while others migrate into the tissues where they develop into macrophages both types of cell produce interleukin 1 which acts on the hypothalamus causing the rise in body temperature associated with microbial infections stimulates the production of some globulins by the liver enhances the production of activated tlymphocytes macrophages have important functions in inflammation p 375 and immunity the monocytemacrophage system this system which is sometimes called the reticuloendothelial system consists of the bodys complement of monocytes and macrophages some macrophages are mobile whereas others are fixed these include histiocytes in connective tissues microglia in the brain kupffer cells in the liver alveolar macrophages in the lungs sinuslining macrophages reticular cells in the spleen lymph nodes and thymus gland mesangial cells in the glomerulus of nephrons in the kidney osteoclasts in bone macrophages function in close association with monocytes in the blood and with lymphocytes which influence their activity they are actively phagocytic and if they encounter large amounts of foreign or waste material they tend to multiply at the site and wall off the area isolating the material eg in the lungs when foreign material has been inhaled their numbers are increased in microbial infections collagen diseases and some noninfective bowel conditions lymphocytes lymphocytes are smaller than monocytes and have large nuclei they circulate in the blood and are present in great numbers in lymphatic tissue such as lymph nodes and the spleen lymphocytes develop from pluripotent stem cells in red bone marrow then travel in the blood to lymphoid tissue elsewhere in the body where they are activated ie they become immunocompetent which means they are able to respond to antigens foreign material examples of antigens include cells regarded by lymphocytes as abnormal eg those that have been invaded by viruses cancer cells tissue transplant cells pollen from flowers and plants fungi bacteria some large molecule drugs eg penicillin aspirin although all lymphocytes originate from one type of stem cell when they are activated in lymphatic tissue two distinct types of lymphocyte are produced tlymphocytes and blymphocytes the specific functions of these two types are discussed in chapter 15,leukocytes or white blood cells play a critical role in defending the body against microbes and foreign materials they are the largest blood cells accounting for about 1 of blood volume and contain nuclei leukocytes are divided into two main types granulocytes and agranulocytes granulocytes including neutrophils eosinophils and basophils have multilobed nuclei and granules in their cytoplasm neutrophils protect the body by engulfing and digesting microbes through phagocytosis especially during infections and inflammation eosinophils specialize in fighting parasites and contribute to allergic reactions by releasing toxic chemicals basophils closely linked to allergic responses release histamine and heparin when activated by allergens agranulocytes consisting of monocytes and lymphocytes have large nuclei and no granules monocytes circulate in the blood and can transform into macrophages in tissues where they help in immune responses and inflammation lymphocytes originating in bone marrow mature in lymphatic tissues and become either tlymphocytes or blymphocytes both essential for the immune systems ability to recognize and attack pathogens cancer cells and foreign substances like transplanted tissues
thrombocytes platelets these are very small nonnucleated discs 2 to 4 um in diameter derived from the cytoplasm of megakaryocytes in red bone marrow fig 42 they contain a variety of substances that promote blood clotting which causes haemostasis cessation of bleeding the normal blood platelet count is between 200 x 109 1 and 350 x 109 1 200 000 to 350 000mm3 the control of platelet production is not yet entirely clear but it is believed that one stimulus is a fall in platelet count and that a substance called thrombopoietin is involved the life span of platelets is between 8 and 11 days and those not used in haemostasis are destroyed by macrophages mainly in the spleen haemostasis when a blood vessel is damaged loss of blood is stopped and healing occurs in a series of overlapping processes in which platelets play a vital part 1 vasoconstriction when platelets come in contact with a damaged blood vessel their surface becomes sticky and they adhere to the damaged wall they then release serotonin 5hydroxytryptamine which constricts narrows the vessel reducing blood flow through it other chemicals that cause vasoconstriction eg thromboxanes are released by the damaged vessel itself 2 platelet plug formation the adherent platelets clump to each other and release other substances including adenosine diphosphate adp which attract more platelets to the site passing platelets stick to those already at the damaged vessel and they too release their chemicals this is a positive feedback system by which many platelets rapidly arrive at the site of vascular damage and quickly form a temporary seal the platelet plug 3 coagulation blood clotting this is a complex process that also involves a positive feedback system and only a few stages are included here the factors involved are listed in table 43 their numbers represent the order in which they were discovered and not the order of participation in the clotting process blood clotting results in formation of an insoluble threadlike mesh of fibrin which traps blood cells and is much stronger than the rapidly formed platelet plug in the final stages of this process prothrombin activator acts on the plasma protein prothrombin converting it to thrombin thrombin then acts on another plasma protein fibrinogen and converts it to fibrin fig 410 prothrombin activator can be formed by two processes which often occur together the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways fig 410 the extrinsic pathway occurs rapidly within seconds when there is tissue damage outside the circulation damaged tissue releases a complex of chemicals called thromboplastin or tissue factor which initiates coagulation the intrinsic pathway is slower 36 minutes and is confined to the circulation it is triggered by damage to a blood vessel lining endothelium and the effects of platelets adhering to it after a time the clot shrinks squeezing out serum a clear sticky fluid that consists of plasma from which clotting factors have been removed 4 fibrinolysis after the clot has formed the process of removing it and healing the damaged blood vessel begins the breakdown of the clot or fibrinolysis is the first stage an inactive substance called plasminogen is present in the clot and is converted to the enzyme plasmin by activators released from the damaged endothelial cells plasmin initiates the breakdown of fibrin to soluble products that are treated as waste material and removed by phagocytosis as the clot is removed the healing process restores the integrity of the blood vessel wall control of coagulation the process of blood clotting relies heavily on several processes that are selfperpetuating that is once started a positive feedback mechanism promotes their continuation for example thrombin is a powerful stimulator of its own production the body therefore possesses several mechanisms to control and limit the coagulation cascade otherwise once started the clotting process would spread throughout the circulatory system far beyond requirements the main controls are the perfect smoothness of normal blood vessel lining platelets do not adhere to this surface the binding of thrombin to a special thrombin receptor on the cells lining blood vessels once bound thrombin is inactivated the presence of natural anticoagulants eg heparin in the blood which inactivate clotting factors,thrombocytes platelets are small nonnucleated cells essential for blood clotting haemostasis derived from megakaryocytes in red bone marrow they have a lifespan of 8 to 11 days and are destroyed by macrophages mainly in the spleen when a blood vessel is damaged platelets initiate a series of overlapping processes vasoconstriction platelets adhere to the damaged vessel wall releasing serotonin which narrows the vessel and reduces blood flow platelet plug formation platelets clump together releasing adenosine diphosphate adp attracting more platelets to form a temporary seal coagulation a positive feedback system forms a fibrin mesh strengthening the platelet plug this involves converting prothrombin to thrombin which then converts fibrinogen into fibrin solidifying the clot fibrinolysis after the clot forms plasmin breaks down the fibrin allowing the clot to be removed and the vessel to heal the body controls coagulation through mechanisms such as the smoothness of blood vessel linings binding of thrombin to receptors and natural anticoagulants like heparin which prevent excessive clotting
anaemias in anaemia there is not enough haemoglobin available to carry sufficient oxygen from the lungs to supply the needs of the tissues it occurs when the rate of production of mature cells entering the blood from the red bone marrow does not keep pace with the rate of haemolysis the classification of anaemia is based on the cause impaired erythrocyte production iron deficiency megaloblastic anaemias hypoplastic anaemia increased erythrocyte loss haemolytic anaemias normocytic anaemia red cells may appear abnormal when examined microscopically characteristic changes are listed in table 44 signs and symptoms of anaemia relate to the inability of the blood to supply body cells with enough oxygen and may represent adaptive measures examples include tachycardia the heart rate increases to improve blood supply and speed circulation palpitations an awareness of the heartbeat or angina pectoris p 121 these are caused by the increased effort of the overworked heart muscle breathlessness on exertion when oxygen requirements increase respiratory rate and effort rise in an effort to meet the greater demand iron deficiency anaemia this is the most common form of anaemia in many parts of the world the normal daily requirement of iron intake in men is about 1 to 2 mg derived from meat and highly coloured vegetables the normal daily requirement in women is 3 mg the increase is necessary to compensate for loss of blood during menstruation and to meet the needs of the growing fetus during pregnancy children during their period of rapid growth require more than adults the amount of haemoglobin in each cell is regarded as below normal when the mch is less than 27 pgcell the anaemia is regarded as severe when the haemoglobin level is below 9 gdl blood it is caused by deficiency of iron in the bone marrow and may be due to dietary deficiency excessively high requirement or malabsorption usually more than one factor is involved eg loss of blood and malabsorption in this type of anaemia erythrocytes are microcytic and hypochromic because their haemoglobin content is low normal requirements deficient intake because of the relative inefficiency of iron absorption deficiency occurs frequently even in individuals whose requirements are normal the likelihood of deficiency increases if the daily diet is restricted in some way as in poorly planned vegetarian diets or in caloriecontrolled diets where the range of foods eaten is small babies dependent on milk may also suffer mild iron deficiency anaemia if weaning on to a mixed diet is delayed much past the first year since the liver carries only a few months store and milk is a poor source of iron high requirements normal or deficient intake this type of anaemia occurs in pregnancy when iron requirements are increased both for fetal growth and to support the additional load on the mothers cardiovascular system it may also occur as a result of chronic blood loss the causes of which include chronic peptic ulcers menorrhagia intestinal ulceration haemorrhoids carcinoma malabsorption iron absorption is usually increased following haemorrhage but may be reduced in abnormalities of the stomach duodenum or jejunum including resection of stomach or upper part of the small intestine hypochlorhydria eg in malignant disease addisonian pernicious anaemia megaloblastic anaemias maturation of erythrocytes is impaired when deficiency of vitamin b12 andor folic acid occurs fig 43 and abnormally large erythrocytes megaloblasts are found in the blood during normal erythropoiesis fig 42 several cell divisions occur and the daughter cells at each stage are smaller than the parent cell because there is not much time for cell enlargement between divisions when deficiency of vitamin b12 andor folic acid occurs the rate of dna and rna synthesis is reduced delaying cell division the cells can therefore grow larger than normal between divisions circulating cells are immature larger than normal and some are nucleated mcv 94 fl the haemoglobin content of each cell is normal or raised the cells are fragile and their life span is reduced to between 40 and 50 days depressed production and early lysis cause anaemia vitamin b12 deficiency anaemia pernicious anaemia this is the most common form of vitamin b12 deficiency anaemia it occurs more often in females than males usually between 45 and 65 years of age it is an autoimmune disease in which autoantibodies destroy intrinsic factor if and parietal cells in the stomach dietary deficiency of vitamin b12 this is rare except in true vegans ie when no animal products are included in the diet the store of vitamin b12 is such that deficiency takes several years to appear other causes of vitamin b12 deficiency these include the following gastrectomy this leaves fewer cells available to produce if after partial resection of the stomach chronic gastritis malignant disease and ionising radiation these damage the gastric mucosa including the parietal cells that produce if blind loop syndrome this occurs when the contents of the small intestine are slow moving or static allowing microbes to colonise the small intestine and use or destroy the intrinsic factorvitamin b12 ifb12 complex before it reaches the terminal ileum where it is absorbed blind loops of bowel occur in diverticular disease p 328 and are left after some surgical procedures malabsorption of intrinsic factorvitamin bu complex this may follow resection of terminal ileum or inflammation of the terminal ileum eg crohns disease or tropical sprue complications of vitamin b12 deficiency anaemia these may appear before the signs of anaemia they include subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord in which nerve fibres in the posterior and lateral columns of white matter become demyelinated vitamin b12 is essential for the secretion and maintenance of myelin p 142 and p 186 ulceration of the tongue and glossitis folic acid deficiency anaemia deficiency in the bone marrow causes a form of megaloblastic anaemia not associated with degeneration of the spinal cord it may be due to dietary deficiency eg in infants if there is delay in establishing a mixed diet in alcoholics in anorexia and in pregnancy when the requirement is raised malabsorption from the jejunum caused by eg coeliac disease tropical sprue or anticonvulsant drugs interference with use by eg cytotoxic and anticonvulsant drugs,anaemia is a condition where there is insufficient haemoglobin to carry adequate oxygen to body tissues leading to fatigue breathlessness and other symptoms it can occur when the production of red blood cells erythrocytes from bone marrow is impaired or when erythrocyte loss exceeds production anaemia is classified into two main types those due to impaired erythrocyte production such as iron deficiency and megaloblastic anaemias and those due to increased erythrocyte loss such as haemolytic anaemias iron deficiency anaemia is the most common form and occurs when the bodys iron intake or absorption is insufficient to meet its needs often seen in pregnancy menstruation or chronic blood loss this results in smaller red blood cells microcytic with less haemoglobin megaloblastic anaemias arise from vitamin b12 or folic acid deficiencies leading to the production of abnormally large immature red blood cells megaloblasts pernicious anaemia a type of b12 deficiency is an autoimmune disorder that destroys the stomachs intrinsic factor essential for b12 absorption folic acid deficiency common in pregnancy or malabsorption conditions causes similar anaemia but without nerve damage symptoms of anaemia include rapid heartbeat tachycardia breathlessness and palpitations as the body attempts to compensate for reduced oxygen levels
hypoplastic and aplastic anaemias hypoplastic and aplastic anaemias are due to varying degrees of bone marrow failure bone marrow function is reduced in hypoplastic anaemia and absent in aplastic anaemia since the bone marrow produces leukocytes and platelets as well as erythrocytes leukopenia low white cell count and thrombocytopenia low platelet count are likely to accompany diminished red cell numbers when all three cell types are low the condition is called pancytopenia and is accompanied by anaemia diminished immunity and a tendency to bleed the condition is often idiopathic but the known causes include drugs eg cytotoxic drugs some antiinflammatory and anticonvulsant drugs some sulphonamides and antibiotics ionising radiation some chemicals eg benzene and its derivatives chronic nephritis viral disease including hepatitis invasion of bone marrow by eg malignant disease leukaemia or fibrosis haemolytic anaemias these occur when red cells are destroyed while in circulation or are removed prematurely from the circulation because the cells are abnormal or the spleen is overactive congenital haemolytic anaemias in these diseases genetic abnormality leads to the synthesis of abnormal haemoglobin and increased red cell membrane friability reducing cell oxygencarrying capacity and life span the most common forms are sickle cell anaemia and thalassaemia sickle cell anaemia the abnormal haemoglobin molecules become misshapen when deoxygenated making the erythrocytes sickle shaped a high proportion of abnormal molecules makes the sickling permanent the life span of cells is reduced by early haemolysis sickle cells do not move smoothly through the small blood vessels this tends to increase the viscosity of the blood reducing the rate of blood flow and leading to intravascular clotting ischaemia and infarction the anaemia is due to early haemolysis of irreversibly sickled cells blacks are more affected than other races some affected individuals have a degree of immunity to malaria because the life span of the sickled cells is less than the time needed for the malaria parasite to mature inside the cells complications pregnancy infection and dehydration predispose to the development of crises due to intravascular clotting and ischaemia causing severe pain in long bones chest or the abdomen the formation of gallstones cholelithiasis and inflammation of the gall bladder cholecystitis also occurs p 336 thalassaemia there is reduced globin synthesis with resultant reduced haemoglobin production and increased friability of the cell membrane leading to early haemolysis severe cases may cause death in infants or young children this condition is most common in mediterranean countries haemolytic disease of the newborn in this disorder the mothers immune system makes antibodies to the babys red blood cells causing haemolysis and phagocytosis of fetal erythrocytes the antigen system involved is usually but not always the rhesus rh antigen a rh mother carries no rh antigen on her red blood cells but she has the capacity to produce antirh antibodies if she conceives a child fathered by a rh man and the baby inherits the rh antigen from him the baby may also be rh ie different from the mother during pregnancy the placenta protects the baby from the mothers immune system but at delivery a few fetal red blood cells may enter the maternal circulation because they carry an antigen the rh antigen foreign to the mother her immune system will be stimulated to produce neutralising antibodies to it the red cells of second and subsequent rh babies are attacked by these maternal antibodies which can cross the placenta and enter the fetal circulation fig 411 in the most severe cases the baby dies in the womb from profound anaemia in less serious circumstances the baby is born with some degree of anaemia which is corrected with blood transfusions the disease is much less common than it used to be because it was discovered that if a rh mother is given an injection of antirh antibodies within 72 hours of the delivery of a rh baby her immune system does not make its own antirh antibodies to the fetal red cells subsequent pregnancies are therefore not affected the antirh antibodies given to the mother bind to and neutralise any fetal red cells present in her circulation before her immune system becomes sensitised to them acquired haemolytic anaemias in this context acquired means haemolytic anaemia in which no familial or racial factors have been identified there are several causes chemical agents these substances cause early or excessive haemolysis eg some drugs especially when taken long term in large doses eg phenacetin primaquine sulphonamides chemicals encountered in the general or work environment eg lead arsenic compounds toxins produced by microbes eg streptococcus pyogenes clostridium welchii autoimmunity in this disease individuals make antibodies to their own red cell antigens causing haemolysis it may be acute or chronic and primary or secondary to other diseases eg carcinoma viral infection or other autoimmune diseases blood transfusion reactions individuals do not normally produce antibodies to their own red blood cell antigens if they did the antigens and antibodies would react causing clumping and lysis of the erythrocytes see fig 45 p 65 however if individuals receive a transfusion of blood possessing antigens different from their own their immune system will recognise them as foreign make antibodies to them and destroy them transfusion reaction this adverse reaction between the blood of incompatible recipients and donors leads to haemolysis within the recipients cardiovascular system the breakdown products of haemolysis lodge in and block the filtering mechanism of the nephron impairing kidney function other principal signs of a transfusion reaction include fever chills lumbar pain and shock other causes of haemolytic anaemia these include parasitic diseases eg malaria ionising radiation eg xrays radioactive isotopes destruction of blood trapped in tissues in eg severe burns crushing injuries physical damage to cells by eg artificial heart valves kidney dialysis machines normocytic normochromic anaemia in this type the cells are normal but the numbers are reduced and the proportion of reticulocytes in the blood may be increased as the body tries to restore erythrocyte numbers to normal this occurs in many chronic disease conditions eg in chronic inflammation following severe haemorrhage in haemolytic disease,hypoplastic and aplastic anaemias are blood disorders characterized by reduced or absent bone marrow function leading to decreased production of red blood cells white blood cells and platelets this can result in pancytopenia which is the presence of low counts of all three blood cell types causing symptoms like anaemia weakened immunity and increased bleeding key causes of aplastic anaemia drugs eg cytotoxic and antiinflammatory ionizing radiation chemicals eg benzene chronic nephritis viral infections eg hepatitis bone marrow infiltration by malignancies haemolytic anaemias occur due to the destruction of red blood cells either in circulation or prematurely congenital forms such as sickle cell anaemia where red blood cells become sickleshaped due to abnormal haemoglobin and thalassaemia where globin synthesis is reduced lead to increased cell fragility and early haemolysis acquired haemolytic anaemias can arise from chemical agents autoimmune reactions blood transfusion reactions infections and physical damage to red blood cells normocytic normochromic anaemia features normal cell size and color but reduced numbers often seen in chronic diseases or following hemorrhage
polycythaemia there are an abnormally large number of erythrocytes in the blood this increases blood viscosity slows the rate of flow and increases the risk of intravascular clotting ischaemia and infarction relative increase in erythrocyte count this occurs when the erythrocyte count is normal but the blood volume is reduced by fluid loss eg excessive serum exudate from extensive superficial burns true increase in erythrocyte count physiological prolonged hypoxia stimulates erythropoiesis and the number of cells released into the normal volume of blood is increased this occurs in people living at high altitudes where the oxygen tension in the air is low and the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli of the lungs is correspondingly low each cell carries less oxygen so more cells are needed to meet the bodys oxygen needs pathological the reason for this increase in circulating red cells sometimes to twice the normal number is not known it may be secondary to other factors that cause hypoxia of the red bone marrow eg cigarette smoking pulmonary disease bone marrow cancer polycythaemia rubra vera in this primary condition of unknown cause there is abnormal excessive production of the erythrocyte precursors ie myeloproliferation this raises the haemoglobin level and the haematocrit relative proportion of cells to plasma the blood viscosity is increased and may lead to hypertension and cerebral coronary or mesenteric thrombosis aplastic anaemia and leukaemia may also be present leukocyte disorders leukopenia this is the name of the condition in which the total blood leukocyte count is less than 4 x 109 1 4000mm3 granulocytopenia neutropenia this is a general term used to indicate an abnormal reduction in the numbers of circulating granulocytes polymorphonuclear leukocytes commonly called neutropenia because 40 to 75 of granulocytes are neutrophils a reduction in the number of circulating granulocytes occurs when production does not keep pace with the normal removal of cells or when the life span of the cells is reduced extreme shortage or the absence of granulocytes is called agmnulocytosis a temporary reduction occurs in response to inflammation but the numbers are usually quickly restored inadequate granulopoiesis may be caused by drugs eg cytotoxic drugs phenylbutazone phenothiazines some sulphonamides and antibiotics irradiation damage to granulocyte precursors in the bone marrow by eg xrays radioactive isotopes diseases of red bone marrow eg leukaemias some anaemias severe microbial infections in conditions where the spleen is enlarged excessive numbers of granulocytes are trapped reducing the number in circulation neutropenia predisposes to severe infections that can lead to tissue necrosis septicaemia and death septicaemia is the presence of significant numbers of active pathogens in the blood the pathogens are commonly commensals ie microbes that are normally present in the body but do not usually cause infection such as those in the bowel leukocytosis an increase in the number of circulating leukocytes occurs as a normal protective reaction in a variety of pathological conditions especially in response to infections when the infection subsides the leukocyte count returns to normal pathological leukocytosis exists when a blood leukocyte count of more than 11 x 109 1 11 000mm3 is sustained and is not consistent with the normal protective function one or more of the different types of cell is involved leukaemia leukaemia is a malignant proliferation of white blood cell precursors by the bone marrow it results in the uncontrolled increase in the production of leukocytes andor their precursors as the tumour cells enter the blood the total leukocyte count is usually raised but in some cases it may be normal or even low the proliferation of immature leukaemic blast cells crowds out other blood cells formed in bone marrow causing anaemia thrombocytopenia and leukopenia pancytopenia causes of leukaemia some causes of leukaemia are known but many cases cannot be accounted for some people may have a genetic predisposition that is triggered by environmental factors known causes include ionising radiation radiation such as that produced by xrays and radioactive isotopes causes malignant changes in the precursors of white blood cells the dna of the cells may be damaged and some cells die while others reproduce at an abnormally rapid rate leukaemia may develop at any time after irradiation even 20 or more years later chemicals some chemicals encountered in the general or work environment alter the dna of the white cell precursors in the bone marrow these include benzene and its derivatives asbestos cytotoxic drugs chloramphenicol viral infections genetic factors identical twins of leukaemia sufferers have a much higher risk than normal of developing the disease suggesting involvement of genetic factors types of leukaemia leukaemias are usually classified according to the type of cell involved the maturity of the cells and the rate at which the disease develops fig 42 and table 45 acute leukaemias these types usually have a sudden onset and affect the poorly differentiated and immature blast cells fig 42 they are aggressive tumours that reach a climax within a few weeks or months the rapid progress of bone marrow invasion impairs its function and culminates in anaemia haemorrhage and susceptibility to infection the mucous membranes of the mouth and upper gastrointestinal tract are most commonly affected acute myeloblastic leukaemia this occurs at any age but most commonly between 25 and 60 years acute lymphoblastic leukaemia this disease is most common in children under 10 years although a number of cases may occur up to about 40 years of age chronic leukaemias these conditions are less aggressive than the acute forms and the leukocytes are more differentiated ie at the cyte stage fig 42 chronic granulocytic leukaemia there is a gradual increase in the number of immature granulocytes in the blood in the later stages anaemia secondary haemorrhages infections and fever become increasingly severe it is slightly more common in men than women and usually occurs between the ages of 20 and 40 years although treatment may appear to be successful death usually occurs within about 5 years chronic lymphocytic leukaemia there is enlargement of the lymph nodes and hyperplasia of lymphoid tissue throughout the body the lymphocyte count is considerably higher than normal lymphocytes accumulate in the bone marrow and there is progressive anaemia and thrombocytopenia it is three times more common in males than females and it occurs mainly between the ages of 50 and 70 years death is usually due to repeated infections of increasing severity with great variations in survival times,polycythaemia is a condition marked by an excessive number of erythrocytes red blood cells in the blood increasing its viscosity slowing circulation and heightening the risk of clotting ischemia and infarction it can be relative where blood volume decreases due to fluid loss or true where prolonged hypoxia stimulates excess red cell production true polycythaemia occurs in people living at high altitudes or due to pathological conditions like polycythaemia rubra vera where abnormal bone marrow activity leads to excessive erythrocyte production leukocyte disorders include leukopenia a dangerously low count of leukocytes often caused by drugs radiation bone marrow diseases or infections a reduction in neutrophils a key type of leukocyte can lead to severe infections leukocytosis the opposite involves an increased leukocyte count as a natural response to infections but becomes pathological when counts remain abnormally high leukaemia is a malignant overproduction of white blood cells in the bone marrow crowding out normal blood cells and leading to anaemia thrombocytopenia and frequent infections leukaemia may be acute with rapid progression or chronic with slower onset known causes include radiation chemicals viral infections and genetic factors with chronic forms often resulting in enlarged lymph nodes and repeated infections
thrombocytopenia this is defined as a blood platelet count below 150 x 109 1 150 000mm3 but spontaneous capillary bleeding does not usually occur unless the count falls below 30 x 109 1 30 000mm3 it may be due to a reduced rate of platelet production or increased rate of destruction reduced platelet production this is usually due to bone marrow deficiencies and therefore production of erythrocytes and leukocytes is also reduced giving rise to pancytopenia it is often due to platelets being crowded out of the bone marrow in bone marrow diseases eg leukaemias pernicious anaemia malignant tumours ionising radiation eg xrays or radioactive isotopes that damage the rapidly dividing precursor cells in the bone marrow drugs eg cytotoxic drugs chloramphenicol chlorpromazine phenylbutazone sulphonamides increased platelet destruction a reduced platelet count occurs when production of new cells does not keep pace with destruction of damaged and worn out cells this occurs in disseminated intravascular coagulation see below and autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura this condition which usually affects children and young adults may be triggered by a viral infection such as measles antiplatelet antibodies are formed that coat platelets leading to platelet destruction and their removal from the circulation a significant feature of this disease is the presence of purpura which are haemorrhages into the skin ranging in size from pinpoints to large blotches the severity of the disease varies from mild bleeding into the skin to severe haemorrhage when the platelet count is very low there may be severe bruising haematuria gastrointestinal or cranial haemorrhages secondary thrombocytopenic purpura this may occur in association with red bone marrow diseases excessive irradiation and some drugs eg digoxin chlorthiazides quinine sulphonamides vitamin k deficiency vitamin k is required by the liver for the synthesis of many clotting factors and therefore deficiency predisposes to impairment of haemostasis p 67 haemorrhagic disease of the newborn spontaneous haemorrhage from the umbilical cord and intestinal mucosa occurs in babies when the stored vitamin k obtained from the mother before birth has been used up and the intestinal bacteria needed for its synthesis in the infants bowel are not yet established this is most likely to occur when the baby is premature deficient absorption in adults vitamin k is fat soluble and bile salts are required in the colon for its absorption deficiency may occur when there is liver disease prolonged obstruction to the biliary tract or in any other disease where fat absorption is impaired eg coeliac disease dietary deficiency this is rare because a sufficient supply of vitamin k is usually synthesised in the intestine by bacterial action however deficiency may occur during treatment with drugs that sterilise the bowel disseminated intravascular coagulation dic dic is a common complication of a number of other disorders the coagulation system is activated within the blood vessels leading to formation of intravascular clots and deposition of fibrin within the tissues because of this consumption of clotting factors and platelets there is a consequent tendency to haemorrhage the causes of dic include severe shock especially when due to microbial infection septicaemia when endotoxins are released by gramnegative bacteria severe trauma premature separation of placenta when amniotic fluid enters maternal blood acute pancreatitis when digestive enzymes are released into the blood malignant tumours with widely dispersed metastases congenital disorders the haemophilias in each body cell except gametes there are 46 chromosomes arranged in 23 pairs of which one pair are sex chromosomes in the female the two sex chromosomes are identical and are called x chromosomes in the male each cell has one x chromosome and one y chromosome femalexx malexy each gamete ovum and spermatozoon has only 23 chromosomes one from each of the 23 pairs this means that each ovum has an x chromosome and each spermatozoon has either an x or a y chromosome fusion of an ovum with a spermatozoon carrying an x chromosome results in the conception of a female child whereas if the spermatozoon bears a y chromosome the child is male the y chromosome is shorter than and therefore carries fewer genes than the x chromosome traits coded for on the section of the x chromosome that has no corresponding material on the y are said to be sex linked the gene that codes for the synthesis of clotting factors viii and ix is one example and is therefore carried on x chromosomes only if the gene is abnormal on one of a females two x chromosomes she is most likely to have a normal gene on her other x chromosome which ensures production of normal clotting factors a female who carries the faulty gene even though the disease is not expressed in her may pass the faulty gene on to her children and is said to be a carrier if the gene is abnormal in a male who has only one copy of the gene since he has only one x chromosome he will therefore have haemophilia haemophilia is inherited as shown in figure 412 this illustrates the possible genetic combinations of the children of a carrier mother one normal gene and one faulty gene and a normal father one normal gene sufferers from haemophilia experience repeated episodes of severe and prolonged bleeding at any site with little evidence of trauma recurrent bleeding into joints is common causing severe pain and in the long term cartilage is damaged the two main forms of haemophilia differ only in the clotting factor involved the clinical picture in both is identical haemophilia a in this disease factor viii is abnormal and is less biologically active haemophilia b christmas disease this is the less common sexlinked genetic haemorrhagic disease factor ix is deficient resulting in deficiency of thromboplastin von willebrands disease in this disease a deficiency in the von willebrand factor causes low levels of factor viii as the inheritance is not sexlinked haemorrhages due to defective clotting occur equally in males and females,thrombocytopenia is defined as a low blood platelet count below 150000mm with significant bleeding typically occurring when the count drops below 30000mm this condition can result from either reduced platelet production or increased destruction reduced production is often due to bone marrow deficiencies such as in leukemia or pernicious anemia and is sometimes caused by exposure to ionizing radiation or certain drugs increased platelet destruction can occur in conditions like autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura where antibodies destroy platelets leading to bleeding under the skin purpura and more severe hemorrhages vitamin k deficiency also impairs blood clotting as it is essential for synthesizing clotting factors this deficiency can result from poor dietary intake malabsorption conditions or liver disease and it may cause bleeding disorders like haemorrhagic disease in newborns disseminated intravascular coagulation dic is a severe condition where clotting factors and platelets are consumed excessively due to widespread clotting within the blood vessels leading to hemorrhage it can be triggered by infections trauma or complications during pregnancy genetic disorders like haemophilia a and b affect clotting due to deficiencies in factors viii or ix predominantly in males von willebrands disease affects both sexes and leads to poor blood clotting due to low levels of factor viii
the cardiovascular system the cardiovascular system is divided for descriptive purposes into two main parts 1 the circulatory system consisting of the heart which acts as a pump and the blood vessels through which the blood circulates 2 the lymphatic system consisting of lymph nodes and lymph vessels through which colourless lymph flows the two systems communicate with one another and are intimately associated the heart pumps blood into two anatomically separate systems of blood vessels fig 51 the pulmonary circulation the systemic circulation the right side of the heart pumps blood to the lungs the pulmonary circulation where gas exchange occurs ie co2 leaves the blood and enters the lungs and o2 leaves the lungs and enters the blood the left side of the heart pumps blood into the systemic circulation which supplies the rest of the body here tissue wastes are passed into the blood for excretion and body cells extract nutrients and o2 the circulatory system ensures a continuous flow of blood to all body cells and its function is subject to continual physiological adjustments in order to maintain an adequate blood supply should the supply of oxygen and nutrients to body cells become inadequate tissue damage occurs and cell death may follow blood vessels the heart pumps blood into vessels that vary in structure size and function and there are several types arteries arterioles capillaries venules and veins fig 52 arteries and arterioles these are the blood vessels that transport blood away from the heart they vary considerably in size and their walls consist of three layers of tissue fig 53 tunica adventitia or outer layer of fibrous tissue tunica media or middle layer of smooth muscle and elastic tissue tunica intima or inner lining of squamous epithelium called endothelium the amount of muscular and elastic tissue varies in the arteries depending upon their size in the large arteries sometimes called elastic arteries the tunica media consists of more elastic tissue and less smooth muscle these proportions gradually change as the arteries branch many times and become smaller until in the arterioles the smallest arteries the tunica media consists almost entirely of smooth muscle arteries have thicker walls than veins and this enables them to withstand the high pressure of arterial blood anastomoses and endarteries anastomoses are arteries that form a link between main arteries supplying an area eg the arterial supply to the palms of the hand p 102 and soles of the feet the brain the joints and to a limited extent the heart muscle if one artery supplying the area is occluded anastomotic arteries provide a collateral circulation this is most likely to provide an adequate blood supply when the occlusion occurs gradually giving the anastomotic arteries time to dilate endarteries are the arteries with no anastomoses or those beyond the most distal anastomosis eg the branches from the circulus arteriosus circle of willis in the brain or the central artery to the retina of the eye when an endartery is occluded the tissues it supplies die because there is no alternative blood supply veins and venules the veins are the blood vessels that return blood at low pressure to the heart the walls of the veins are thinner than those of arteries but have the same three layers of tissue fig 53 they are thinner because there is less muscle and elastic tissue in the tunica media when cut the veins collapse while the thickerwalled arteries remain open when an artery is cut blood spurts at high pressure while a slower steady flow of blood escapes from a vein some veins possess valves which prevent backflow of blood ensuring that it flows towards the heart fig 54 valves are abundant in the veins of the limbs especially the lower limbs where blood must travel a considerable distance against gravity when the individual is standing valves are absent in very small and very large veins in the thorax and abdomen they are formed by a fold of tunica intima strengthened by connective tissue the cusps are semilunar in shape with the concavity towards the heart the smallest veins are called venules capillaries and sinusoids the smallest arterioles break up into a number of minute vessels called capillaries capillary walls consist of a single layer of endothelial cells through which water and other smallmolecule substances can pass blood cells and largemolecule substances such as plasma proteins do not normally pass through capillary walls the capillaries form a vast network of tiny vessels which link the smallest arterioles to the smallest venules their diameter is approximately that of an erythrocyte 7 um the capillary bed is the site of exchange of substances between the blood and the tissue fluid which bathes the body cells sinusoids are wider than capillaries and have extremely thin walls separating blood from the neighbouring cells in some there are distinct spaces between the endothelial cells among the endothelial cells there may be many phagocytic macrophages eg kupffer cells in the liver sinusoids are found in bone marrow endocrine glands spleen and liver because of their larger lumen the blood pressure in sinusoids is lower than in capillaries and there is a slower rate of blood flow control of blood vessel diameter all blood vessels except capillaries have smooth muscle fibres in the tunica media which are supplied by nerves of the autonomic nervous system these nerves arise from the vasomotor centre in the medulla oblongata and they change the diameter of the lumen of blood vessels controlling the volume of blood they contain mediumsized and small arteries have more muscle than elastic tissue in their walls in large arteries such as the aorta the middle layer is almost entirely elastic tissue this means that small arteries and arterioles respond to nerve stimulation whereas the diameter of large arteries varies according to the amount of blood they contain vasodilatation and vasoconstriction sympathetic nerves supply the smooth muscle of the tunica media of blood vessels there is no parasympathetic nerve supply to most blood vessels and therefore the diameter of the vessel lumen and the tone of the smooth muscle is determined by the degree of sympathetic nerve stimulation there is always some nerve input to the smooth muscle in the vessel walls which can then be increased or decreased fig 55 decreased nerve stimulation causes the smooth muscle to relax thinning the vessel wall and enlarging the lumen this process is called vasodilatation and results in increased blood flow under less resistance conversely when nervous activity is increased the smooth muscle of the tunica media contracts and thickens this process is called vasoconstriction the blood vessels primarily responsible for providing resistance to blood flow are the small arterioles the walls of which consist mainly of smooth muscle a small change in their lumen results in considerable alteration in blood flow to the part of the body they supply arterioles provide the peripheral resistance to the flow of blood and are therefore called resistance vessels this is important in maintaining homeostasis of blood pressure p 91 resistance to flow of fluids along a tube is determined by three factors the diameter of the tube the length of the tube and the viscosity of the fluid involved the most important factor in relation to flow of blood along vessels is peripheral resistance the length of the vessels and viscosity of blood could also contribute but in health these are constant and are therefore not significant determinants of changes in blood flow autoregulation the accumulation of metabolites in local tissues also influences the degree of dilatation of arterioles this mechanism ensures that local blood flow is increased or decreased in response to tissue need for example in exercise eg lactic acid accumulation in muscle causes vasodilatation hypoxia vasodilatation follows an episode of reduced tissue blood flow tissue damage eg in inflammation mediators such as histamine prostaglandins and bradykinin lead to vasodilatation p 376 situations where the circulation to vital organs such as the brain and heart is threatened,the cardiovascular system is composed of two main parts the circulatory system involving the heart and blood vessels and the lymphatic system consisting of lymph nodes and vessels the heart pumps blood through two circuits the pulmonary circulation sends blood to the lungs for oxygen exchange while the systemic circulation delivers oxygen and nutrients to the rest of the body blood vessels including arteries veins and capillaries play distinct roles arteries carry oxygenrich blood away from the heart while veins return deoxygenated blood to the heart capillaries are tiny vessels where the exchange of gases nutrients and waste occurs between blood and tissues blood flow is regulated by the autonomic nervous system through vasodilation widening of vessels and vasoconstriction narrowing of vessels controlled by smooth muscle in the vessel walls arterioles the smallest arteries are primarily responsible for peripheral resistance which influences blood pressure in certain conditions like exercise hypoxia or tissue damage local blood flow adjusts through a process called autoregulation this ensures that blood supply matches the needs of the tissues ensuring efficient nutrient delivery and waste removal
blood supply the outer layers of tissue of thickwalled blood vessels receive their blood supply via a network of blood vessels called the vasa vasorum vessels with thin walls and the endothelium of the others receive oxygen and nutrients by diffusion from the blood passing through them internal respiration internal respiration fig 56 is the exchange of gases between capillary blood and local body cells oxygen is carried from the lungs to the tissues in chemical combination with haemoglobin as oxyhaemoglobin the exchange in the tissues takes place between blood at the arterial end of the capillaries and the tissue fluid and then between the tissue fluid and the cells the process involved is that of diffusion from a higher concentration of oxygen in the blood to a lower concentration in the cells ie down the concentration gradient oxyhaemoglobin is an unstable compound and breaks up dissociates easily to liberate oxygen factors that increase dissociation include raised carbon dioxide content of tissue fluid raised temperature and 23 diphosphoglycerate dpg a substance present in red blood cells in active tissues there is an increased production of carbon dioxide and heat which leads to an increased availability of oxygen in this way oxygen is available to the tissues in greatest need dpg is produced in red blood cells and causes haemoglobin to give up its oxygen more readily erythrocyte production of dpg increases in anaemia and other conditions promoting oxygen release to the tissues carbon dioxide is one of the waste products of cell metabolism and towards the venous end of the capillary it diffuses into the blood down the concentration gradient blood transports carbon dioxide to the lungs for excretion by three different mechanisms dissolved in the water of the blood plasma 7 in chemical combination with sodium in the form of sodium bicarbonate 70 remainder in combination with haemoglobin 23 cell nutrition the nutrients required by the cells of the body are transported round the body in the blood plasma in passing from the blood to the cells the nutrients pass through the semipermeable capillary walls into the tissue fluid which bathes the cells then through the cell membrane into the cell the mechanism of the transfer of water and other substances from the blood capillaries depends mainly upon diffusion osmosis and active transport diffusion p 26 the capillary walls consist of a single layer of epithelial cells that constitutes a semipermeable membrane which allows substances with small molecules to pass through into tissue fluid and retains large molecules in the blood diffusible substances include dissolved oxygen and carbon dioxide glucose amino acids fatty acids glycerol vitamins mineral salts and water osmosis p 27 osmotic pressure across a semipermeable membrane draws water from a dilute to a more concentrated solution in an attempt to establish a state of equilibrium the force of the osmotic pressure depends on the number of nondiffusible particles in the solutions separated by the membrane the main substances responsible for the osmotic pressure between blood and tissue fluid are the plasma proteins especially albumin capillary fluid dynamics at the arterial end the capillary blood pressure ie hydrostatic pressure is about 35 mmhg 5 kpa this causes the forward movement of blood and forces some water and solutes of small enough molecular size to pass out of the capillaries into the tissue spaces the osmotic pressure in the capillaries is about 25 mmhg 3 kpa this pressure draws water into the capillaries and is exerted mainly by plasma proteins of molecular size too large to pass through the capillary walls the net outward pressure of 10 mmhg is the difference between the hydrostatic and osmotic pressures figs 57 and 58 at the venous end of the capillaries hydrostatic pressure is reduced to about 15 mmhg 2 kpa and the osmotic pressure remains the same at 25 mmhg 3 kpa the net force moving water and solvents into the capillaries is again the difference between the two pressures ie 10 mmhg this transfer of substances including water to the tissue spaces is a dynamic process as blood flows slowly through the large network of capillaries from the arterial to the venous end there is constant change not all the water and cell waste products return to the blood capillaries the excess is drained away from the tissue spaces in the minute lymph capillaries which originate as blindend tubes with walls similar to but more permeable than those of the blood capillaries fig 57 extra tissue fluid and some cell waste materials enter the lymph capillaries and are eventually returned to the bloodstream ch 6,the outer layers of thickwalled blood vessels receive their blood supply through a network called the vasa vasorum ensuring that these tissues remain nourished in contrast thinwalled vessels and their endothelium obtain oxygen and nutrients directly via diffusion from the blood flowing within them internal respiration is a crucial process involving the exchange of gases between capillary blood and body cells oxygen transported as oxyhaemoglobin moves from the lungs to tissues where it dissociates into oxygen and hemoglobin to meet cellular demands this process occurs through diffusion moving from areas of higher concentration blood to lower concentration cells several factors including elevated carbon dioxide levels increased temperature and the presence of 23 diphosphoglycerate dpg in red blood cells enhance the release of oxygen conversely carbon dioxide a metabolic waste product is transported back to the lungs for excretion through three mechanisms dissolved in plasma 7 as sodium bicarbonate 70 and bound to hemoglobin 23 cell nutrition involves the movement of essential nutrients from blood plasma into cells through semipermeable capillary walls utilizing processes like diffusion osmosis and active transport this dynamic transfer also includes the drainage of excess tissue fluid into lymph capillaries maintaining homeostasis
heart the heart is a roughly coneshaped hollow muscular organ it is about 10 cm long and is about the size of the owners fist it weighs about 225 g in women and is heavier in men about 310 g position the heart lies in the thoracic cavity in the mediastinum between the lungs fig 59 it lies obliquely a little more to the left than the right and presents a base above and an apex below the apex is about 9 cm to the left of the midline at the level of the 5th intercostal space ie a little below the nipple and slightly nearer the midline the base extends to the level of the 2nd rib organs associated with the heart fig 510 inferiorly the apex rests on the central tendon of the diaphragm superiorly the great blood vessels ie the aorta superior vena cava pulmonary artery and pulmonary veins posteriorly the oesophagus trachea left and right bronchus descending aorta inferior vena cava and thoracic vertebrae laterally the lungs the left lung overlaps the left side of the heart anteriorly the sternum ribs and intercostal muscles structure the heart is composed of three layers of tissue fig 511 pericardium myocardium and endocardium pericardium the pericardium is made up of two sacs the outer sac consists of fibrous tissue and the inner of a continuous double layer of serous membrane the outer fibrous sac is continuous with the tunica adventitia of the great blood vessels above and is adherent to the diaphragm below its inelastic fibrous nature prevents overdistension of the heart the outer layer of the serous membrane the parietal pericardium lines the fibrous sac the inner layer the visceral pericardium or epicardium which is continuous with the parietal pericardium is adherent to the heart muscle a similar arrangement of a double membrane forming a closed space is seen also with the pleura the membrane enclosing the lungs see fig 1016 p 251 the serous membrane consists of flattened epithelial cells it secretes serous fluid into the space between the visceral and parietal layers which allows smooth movement between them when the heart beats the space between the parietal and visceral pericardium is only a potential space in health the two layers are in close association with only the thin film of serous fluid between them myocardium the myocardium is composed of specialised cardiac muscle found only in the heart fig 512 it is not under voluntary control but like skeletal muscle crossstripes are seen on microscopic examination each fibre cell has a nucleus and one or more branches the ends of the cells and their branches are in very close contact with the ends and branches of adjacent cells microscopically these joints or intercalated discs can be seen as thicker darker lines than the ordinary crossstripes this arrangement gives cardiac muscle the appearance of being a sheet of muscle rather than a very large number of individual cells because of the endtoend continuity of the fibres each one does not need to have a separate nerve supply when an impulse is initiated it spreads from cell to cell via the branches and intercalated discs over the whole sheet of muscle causing contraction the sheet arrangement of the myocardium enables the atria and ventricles to contract in a coordinated and efficient manner the myocardium is thickest at the apex and thins out towards the base fig 515 this reflects the amount of work each chamber contributes to the pumping of blood it is thickest in the left ventricle the atria and the ventricles are separated by a ring of fibrous tissue that does not conduct electrical impulses consequently when a wave of electrical activity passes over the atrial muscle it can only spread to the ventricles through the conducting system which bridges the fibrous ring from atria to ventricles p 87 endocardium this forms the lining of the myocardium and the heart valves it is a thin smooth glistening membrane which permits smooth flow of blood inside the heart it consists of flattened epithelial cells continuous with the endothelium that lines the blood vessels interior of the heart the heart is divided into a right and left side by the septum fig 514 a partition consisting of myocardium covered by endocardium after birth blood cannot cross the septum from one side to the other each side is divided by an atrioventricular valve into an upper chamber the atrium and a lower chamber the ventricle fig 515 the atrioventricular valves are formed by double folds of endocardium strengthened by a little fibrous tissue the right atrioventricular valve tricuspid valve has three flaps or cusps and the left atrioventricular valve mitral valve has two cusps the valves between the atria and ventricles open and close passively according to changes in pressure in the chambers they open when the pressure in the atria is greater than that in the ventricles during ventricular systole contraction the pressure in the ventricles rises above that in the atria and the valves snap shut preventing backward flow of blood the valves are prevented from opening upwards into the atria by tendinous cords called chordae tendineae which extend from the inferior surface of the cusps to little projections of myocardium covered with endothelium called papillary muscles fig 514,the heart is a coneshaped muscular organ about 10 cm long located in the thoracic cavity between the lungs positioned slightly to the left it rests on the diaphragm and is surrounded by vital structures like the lungs esophagus and major blood vessels including the aorta and vena cava the hearts apex points downwards and its base lies near the 2nd rib the heart consists of three main layers pericardium a doublelayered sac that protects the heart and prevents overexpansion it secretes serous fluid reducing friction as the heart beats myocardium the thick muscular middle layer responsible for contraction and pumping blood it consists of cardiac muscle fibers that work in a coordinated manner due to the intercalated discs connecting them endocardium a smooth inner lining that ensures blood flows easily within the heart chambers and covers the heart valves the heart is divided into two sides by the septum with each side having an upper atrium and a lower ventricle the atrioventricular valves tricuspid and mitral control blood flow between the atria and ventricles ensuring oneway movement tendinous cords chordae tendineae and papillary muscles prevent these valves from inverting during contraction ensuring efficient blood circulation
flow of blood through the heart fig 516 the two largest veins of the body the superior and inferior venae cavae empty their contents into the right atrium this blood passes via the right atrioventricular valve into the right ventricle and from there it is pumped into the pulmonary artery or trunk the only artery in the body which carries deoxygenated blood the opening of the pulmonary artery is guarded by the pulmonary valve formed by three semilunar cusps this valve prevents the back flow of blood into the right ventricle when the ventricular muscle relaxes after leaving the heart the pulmonary artery divides into left and right pulmonary arteries which carry the venous blood to the lungs where exchange of gases takes place carbon dioxide is excreted and oxygen is absorbed two pulmonary veins from each lung carry oxygenated blood back to the left atrium blood then passes through the left atrioventricular valve into the left ventricle and from there it is pumped into the aorta the first artery of the general circulation the opening of the aorta is guarded by the aortic valve formed by three semilunar cusps fig 517 from this sequence of events it can be seen that the blood passes from the right to the left side of the heart via the lungs or pulmonary circulation fig 518 however it should be noted that both atria contract at the same time and this is followed by the simultaneous contraction of both ventricles the muscle layer of the walls of the atria is very thin in comparison with that of the ventricles fig 516 this is consistent with the amount of work it does the atria usually assisted by gravity only propel the blood through the atrioventricular valves into the ventricles whereas the ventricles actively pump the blood to the lungs and round the whole body the muscle layer is thickest in the wall of the left ventricle the pulmonary trunk leaves the heart from the upper part of the right ventricle and the aorta leaves from the upper part of the left ventricle blood supply to the heart arterial supply fig 519 the heart is supplied with arterial blood by the right and left coronary arteries which branch from the aorta immediately distal to the aortic valve figs 517 and 519 the coronary arteries receive about 5 of the blood pumped from the heart although the heart comprises a small proportion of body weight this large blood supply especially to the left ventricle highlights the importance of the heart to body function the coronary arteries traverse the heart eventually forming a vast network of capillaries venous drainage most of the venous blood is collected into several small veins that join to form the coronary sinus which opens into the right atrium the remainder passes directly into the heart chambers through little venous channels conducting system of the heart the heart has an intrinsic system whereby the cardiac muscle is automatically stimulated to contract without the need for a nerve supply from the brain fig 520 however the intrinsic system can be stimulated or depressed by nerve impulses initiated in the brain and by circulating chemicals including hormones there are small groups of specialised neuromuscular cells in the myocardium which initiate and conduct impulses causing coordinated and synchronised contraction of the heart muscle sinoatrial node sa node this small mass of specialised cells is in the wall of the right atrium near the opening of the superior vena cava the sa node is the pacemaker of the heart because it normally initiates impulses more rapidly than other groups of neuromuscular cells atrioventricular node av node this small mass of neuromuscular tissue is situated in the wall of the atrial septum near the atrioventricular valves normally the av node is stimulated by impulses that sweep over the atrial myocardium however it too is capable of initiating impulses that cause contraction but at a slower rate than the sa node atrioventricular bundle av bundle or bundle of his this is a mass of specialised fibres that originate from the av node the av bundle crosses the fibrous ring that separates atria and ventricles then at the upper end of the ventricular septum it divides into right and left bundle branches within the ventricular myocardium the branches break up into fine fibres called the purkinje fibres the av bundle bundle branches and purkinje fibres convey electrical impulses from the av node to the apex of the myocardium where the wave of ventricular contraction begins then sweeps upwards and outwards pumping blood into the pulmonary artery and the aorta nerve supply to the heart in addition to the intrinsic impulses generated within the conducting system described above the heart is influenced by autonomic nerves originating in the cardiovascular centre in the medulla oblongata which reach it through the autonomic nervous system these consist of parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves and their actions are antagonistic to one another the vagus nerves parasympathetic supply mainly the sa and av nodes and atrial muscle parasympathetic stimulation reduces the rate at which impulses are produced decreasing the rate and force of the heart beat the sympathetic nerves supply the sa and av nodes and the myocardium of atria and ventricles sympathetic stimulation increases the rate and force of the heart beat factors affecting heart rate autonomic nervous system as described above the rate at which the heart beats is a balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity and this is the most important factor in determining heart rate circulating chemicals the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline secreted by the adrenal medulla have the same effect as sympathetic stimulation ie they increase the heart rate other hormones including thyroxine increase heart rate by their metabolic effect some drugs dissolved gases and electrolytes in the blood may either increase or decrease the heart rate position when the person is upright the heart rate is usually faster than when lying down exercise active muscles need more blood than resting muscles and this is achieved by an increased heart rate and selective vasodilatation emotional states during excitement fear or anxiety the heart rate is increased other effects mediated by the sympathetic nervous system may be present see fig 743 p 171 gender the heart rate is faster in women than men age in babies and small children the heart rate is more rapid than in older children and adults,the heart receives deoxygenated blood into the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae this blood passes through the right atrioventricular valve into the right ventricle then pumped through the pulmonary valve to the pulmonary artery the pulmonary artery carries the blood to the lungs for gas exchange where carbon dioxide is removed and oxygen is absorbed oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins passes through the left atrioventricular valve into the left ventricle and is then pumped into the aorta for systemic circulation the coronary arteries supply the heart with blood while venous drainage occurs through the coronary sinus the sinoatrial sa node acts as the hearts pacemaker generating electrical impulses these travel through the atrioventricular av node av bundle his and purkinje fibers coordinating heart contractions heart rate is regulated by the autonomic nervous system and can be influenced by hormones exercise emotions position and age the sympathetic system increases heart rate while the parasympathetic system decreases it
the cardiac cycle the function of the heart is to maintain a constant circulation of blood throughout the body the heart acts as a pump and its action consists of a series of events known as the cardiac cycle fig 521 during each heartbeat or cardiac cycle the heart contracts and then relaxes the period of contraction is called systole and that of relaxation diastole stages of the cardiac cycle the normal number of cardiac cycles per minute ranges from 60 to 80 taking 74 as an example each cycle lasts about 08 of a second and consists of atrial systole contraction of the atria ventricular systole contraction of the ventricles complete cardiac diastole relaxation of the atria and ventricles it does not matter at which stage of the cardiac cycle a description starts for convenience the period when the atria are filling has been chosen the superior vena cava and the inferior vena cava transport deoxygenated blood into the right atrium at the same time as the four pulmonary veins convey oxygenated blood into the left atrium the atrioventricular valves are open and blood flows through to the ventricles the sa node triggers a wave of contraction that spreads over the myocardium of both atria emptying the atria and completing ventricular filling atrial systole 01 s when the wave of contraction reaches the av node it is stimulated to emit an impulse which quickly spreads to the ventricular muscle via the av bundle the bundle branches and purkinje fibres this results in a wave of contraction which sweeps upwards from the apex of the heart and across the walls of both ventricles pumping the blood into the pulmonary artery and the aorta ventricular systole 03 s the high pressure generated during ventricular contraction is greater than that in the aorta and forces the atrioventricular valves to close preventing backflow of blood into the atria after contraction of the ventricles there is complete cardiac diastole a period of 04 seconds when atria and ventricles are relaxed during this time the myocardium recovers until it is able to contract again and the atria refill in preparation for the next cycle the valves of the heart and of the great vessels open and close according to the pressure within the chambers of the heart the av valves are open while the ventricular muscle is relaxed during atrial filling and systole when the ventricles contract there is a gradual increase in the pressure in these chambers and when it rises above atrial pressure the atrioventricular valves close when the ventricular pressure rises above that in the pulmonary artery and in the aorta the pulmonary and aortic valves open and blood flows into these vessels when the ventricles relax and the pressure within them falls the reverse process occurs first the pulmonary and aortic valves close then the atrioventricular valves open and the cycle begins again this sequence of opening and closing valves ensures that the blood flows in only one direction fig 522 this figure also shows how the walls of the aorta and other elastic arteries stretch and recoil in response to blood pumped into them heart sounds the individual is not usually conscious of his heartbeat but if the ear or the diaphragm of a stethoscope is placed on the chest wall a little below the left nipple and slightly nearer the midline the heartbeat can be heard two sounds separated by a short pause can be clearly distinguished they are described in words as lub dup the first sound lub is fairly loud and is due to the closure of the atrioventricular valves this corresponds with ventricular systole the second sound dup is softer and is due to the closure of the aortic and pulmonary valves this corresponds with atrial systole electrical changes in the heart as the body fluids and tissues are good conductors of electricity the electrical activity within the heart can be detected by attaching electrodes to the surface of the body the pattern of electrical activity may be displayed on an oscilloscope screen or traced on paper the apparatus used is an electrocardiograph and the tracing is an electrocardiogram ecg the normal ecg tracing shows five waves which by convention have been named p q r s and t fig 523 the p wave arises when the impulse from the sa node sweeps over the atria the qrs complex represents the very rapid spread of the impulse from the av node through the av bundle and the purkinje fibres and the electrical activity of the ventricular muscle the t wave represents the relaxation of the ventricular muscle the ecg described above originates from the sa node and is known as sinus rhythm the rate of sinus rhythm is 60 to 100 beats per minute a faster heart rate is called tachycardia and a slower heart rate bradycardia by examining the pattern of waves and the time interval between cycles and parts of cycles information about the state of the myocardium and the cardiac conduction system is obtained cardiac output the cardiac output is the amount of blood ejected from the heart the amount expelled by each contraction of the ventricles is the stroke volume cardiac output is expressed in litres per minute 1min and is calculated by multiplying the stroke volume by the heart rate measured in beats per minute cardiac output stroke volume x heart rate in a healthy adult at rest the stroke volume is approximately 70 ml and if the heart rate is 72 per minute the cardiac output is 51minute this can be greatly increased to meet the demands of exercise to around 251minute and in athletes up to 351minute this increase during exercise is called the cardiac reserve when increased blood supply is needed to meet increased tissue requirements of oxygen and nutrients heart rate andor stroke volume can be increased stroke volume the stroke volume is determined by the volume of blood in the ventricles immediately before they contract ie the ventricular enddiastolic volume vedv sometimes called preload this depends on the amount of blood returning to the heart through the superior and inferior venae cavae the venous return increased vedv leads to stronger myocardial contraction and more blood is expelled in turn the stroke volume and cardiac output rise this capacity to increase the stroke volume with increasing vedv is finite and when the limit is reached ie the cardiac output cannot match the venous return the cardiac output decreases and the heart begins to fail p 119 other factors that increase myocardial contraction include increased stimulation of the sympathetic nerves innervating the heart hormones eg adrenaline noradrenaline thyroxine arterial blood pressure this affects the stroke volume as it creates resistance to blood being pumped from the ventricles into the great arteries this resistance sometimes called afterload is determined by the distensibility or elasticity of the large arteries and the peripheral resistance of arterioles blood volume this is normally kept constant by the kidneys and if deficient the stroke volume cardiac output and venous return decrease venous return venous return is the major determinant of cardiac output and normally the heart pumps out all blood returned to it the force of contraction of the left ventricle ejecting blood into the aorta is not sufficient to return the blood through the veins and back to the heart other factors are involved the position of the body gravity assists the venous return from the head and neck when standing or sitting and offers less resistance to venous return from the lower parts of the body when an individual is lying flat muscular contraction back flow of blood in veins of the limbs especially when standing is prevented by valves the contraction of skeletal muscles surrounding the deep veins puts pressure on them pushing blood towards the heart fig 524 in the lower limbs this is called the skeletal muscle pump when the pressure in deep veins is lowered during muscle relaxation blood flows into them from superficial veins through communicating veins the respiratory pump during inspiration the expansion of the chest creates a negative pressure within the thorax assisting flow of blood towards the heart in addition when the diaphragm descends during inspiration the increased intraabdominal pressure pushes blood towards the heart,the cardiac cycle describes the events during one heartbeat involving contraction systole and relaxation diastole of the heart it has three stages atrial systole atria contract moving blood to the ventricles ventricular systole ventricles contract pushing blood into the lungs and body and complete cardiac diastole relaxation of both chambers the heart valves ensure that blood flows in one direction the familiar heart sounds lubdup are caused by the closure of the atrioventricular valves lub and the aortic and pulmonary valves dup the hearts contractions are triggered by electrical impulses starting from the sa node pacemaker which can be observed using an ecg this trace shows the p wave atrial contraction qrs complex ventricular contraction and t wave ventricular relaxation cardiac output the amount of blood pumped per minute is influenced by stroke volume and heart rate proper venous return is essential for heart function and is aided by factors like muscle contraction gravity and the respiratory pump
blood pressure blood pressure is the force or pressure which the blood exerts on the walls of the blood vessels the systemic arterial blood pressure usually called simply arterial blood pressure is the result of the discharge of blood from the left ventricle into the already full aorta when the left ventricle contracts and pushes blood into the aorta the pressure produced within the arterial system is called the systolic blood pressure in adults it is about 120 mmhg millimetres of mercury or 16 kpa kilopascals when complete cardiac diastole occurs and the heart is resting following the ejection of blood the pressure within the arteries is called diastolic blood pressure in an adult this is about 80 mmhg or 11 kpa the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressures is the pulse pressure these figures vary according to the time of day the posture gender and age of the individual during bedrest at night the blood pressure tends to be lower it increases with age and is usually higher in women than in men arterial blood pressure is measured with a sphygmomanometer and is usually expressed in the following manner bp 122 mmhg or bp 16 kpa the elasticity of the artery walls there is a considerable amount of elastic tissue in the arterial walls especially in large arteries therefore when the left ventricle ejects blood into the already full aorta it distends then the elastic recoil pushes the blood onwards this distension and recoil occurs throughout the arterial system during cardiac diastole the elastic recoil of the arteries maintains the diastolic pressure fig 522 systemic arterial blood pressure maintains the essential flow of substances into and out of the organs of the body control of blood pressure especially to the vital organs is essential to maintain homeostasis the blood pressure is maintained within normal limits by fine adjustments blood pressure is determined by cardiac output and peripheral resistance blood pressure cardiac output x peripheral resistance cardiac output the cardiac output is determined by the stroke volume and the heart rate factors that affect the heart rate and stroke volume are described above and they may increase or decrease cardiac output and in turn blood pressure an increase in cardiac output raises both the systolic and diastolic pressure an increase in stroke volume increases systolic pressure more than it does diastolic pressure peripheral or arteriolar resistance arterioles are the smallest arteries and they have a tunica media composed almost entirely of smooth muscle which responds to nerve and chemical stimulation constriction and dilatation of the arterioles are the main determinants of peripheral resistance p 80 vasoconstriction causes blood pressure to rise and vasodilatation causes it to fall when elastic tissue in the tunica media is replaced by inelastic fibrous tissue as part of the ageing process blood pressure rises dilatation and constriction of arterioles occurs selectively around the body resulting in changes in the blood flow through organs according to their needs the highest priorities are the blood supply to the brain and the heart muscle and in an emergency supplies to other parts of the body are reduced in order to ensure an adequate supply to these organs generally changes in the amount of blood flowing to any organ depend on how active it is a very active organ needs more oxygen and nutrients than a resting organ and it produces more waste materials for excretion control of blood pressure bp blood pressure is controlled in two ways shortterm control on a momenttomoment basis which mainly involves the baroreceptor reflex to be discussed below and also chemoreceptors and circulating hormones longterm control which involves regulation of blood volume by the kidneys and the reninangiotensin aldosterone system p 223 the cardiovascular centre cvc is a collection of interconnected neurones in the brain and is situated within the medulla and pons the cvc receives integrates and coordinates inputs from baroreceptors pressure receptors chemoreceptors higher centres in the brain the cvc sends autonomic nerves both sympathetic and parasympathetic to the heart and blood vessels it controls bp by slowing down or speeding up the heart rate and by dilating or constricting blood vessels activity in these fibres is essential for control of blood pressure fig 525 the two divisions of the autonomic nervous system the sympathetic and the parasympathetic systems are described more fully in chapter 7 their actions relating to the heart and blood vessels are summarised in table 51 baroreceptors these are nerve endings sensitive to pressure changes stretch within the vessel situated in the arch of the aorta and in the carotid sinuses fig 526 and are the bodys principal momenttomoment regulatory mechanism for controlling blood pressure a rise in blood pressure in these arteries stimulates the baroreceptors increasing their input to the cvc the cvc responds by increasing parasympathetic nerve activity to the heart this slows the heart down at the same time sympathetic stimulation to the blood vessels is inhibited causing vasodilatation the net result is a fall in systemic blood pressure conversely if pressure within the aortic arch and carotid sinuses falls the rate of baroreceptor discharge also falls the cvc responds by increasing sympathetic drive to the heart to speed it up sympathetic activity in blood vessels is also increased leading to vasoconstriction both these measures counteract the falling blood pressure baroreceptor control of blood pressure is also called the baroreceptor reflex fig 526 chemoreceptors these are nerve endings situated in the carotid and aortic bodies they are primarily involved in control of respiration p 256 they are sensitive to changes in the levels of carbon dioxide oxygen and the acidity of the blood ph their input to the cvc influences its output only when severe disruption of respiratory function occurs or when arterial bp falls to less than 80 mmhg the effects are outlined in figure 527 higher centres in the brain input to the cvc from the higher centres is influenced by emotional states such as fear anxiety pain and anger that may stimulate changes in blood pressure the hypothalamus in the brain controls body temperature and influences the cvc which responds by adjusting the diameter of blood vessels in the skin an important mechanism in determining heat loss and retention p 365,blood pressure is the force blood exerts on artery walls during circulation it is measured in two values systolic pressure when the heart contracts and pumps blood into the aorta and diastolic pressure when the heart relaxes in adults normal systolic pressure is about 120 mmhg and diastolic pressure is around 80 mmhg the difference between them is called pulse pressure blood pressure is determined by cardiac output the volume of blood the heart pumps per minute and peripheral resistance resistance in small arteries or arterioles increased cardiac output or arteriolar constriction raises blood pressure control of blood pressure happens through shortterm mechanisms like the baroreceptor reflex where baroreceptors in the aorta and carotid arteries detect changes and signal the cardiovascular center cvc in the brain to adjust heart rate and vessel diameter longterm regulation is achieved by the kidneys which control blood volume through the reninangiotensinaldosterone system chemoreceptors also play a role in detecting oxygen and carbon dioxide levels influencing blood pressure in critical conditions emotional states and temperature changes controlled by higher brain centers can further affect blood pressure
pulse the pulse is a wave of distension and elongation felt in an artery wall due to the contraction of the left ventricle forcing about 60 to 80 millilitres of blood through the already full aorta and into the arterial system when the aorta is distended a wave passes along the walls of the arteries and can be felt at any point where a superficial artery can be pressed gently against a bone fig 528 the number of pulse beats per minute normally represents the heart rate and varies considerably in different people and in the same person at different times an average of 60 to 80 is common at rest information that may be obtained from the pulse includes the rate at which the heart is beating the regularity with which the heartbeats occur ie the length of time between beats should be the same the volume or strength of the beat it should be possible to compress the artery with moderate pressure stopping the flow of blood the compressibility of the blood vessel gives some indication of the blood pressure and the state of the blood vessel wall the tension the artery wall should feel soft and pliant under the fingers factors affecting the pulse rate in health the pulse rate and the heart rate are identical factors influencing heart rate are summarised on page 87 in certain circumstances the pulse may be less than the heart rate this may occur for example if the arteries supplying the peripheral tissues are narrowed or blocked and the blood therefore is not pumped through them with each heartbeat the heart is diseased or failing and is unable to generate enough force with each contraction to circulate blood to the peripheral arteries circulation of the blood although circulation of blood round the body is continuous fig 518 it is convenient to describe it in two parts pulmonary circulation systemic or general circulation pulmonary circulation this consists of the circulation of blood from the right ventricle of the heart to the lungs and back to the left atrium in the lungs carbon dioxide is excreted and oxygen is absorbed the pulmonary artery or trunk carrying deoxygenated blood leaves the upper part of the right ventricle of the heart it passes upwards and divides into left and right pulmonary arteries at the level of the 5th thoracic vertebra the left pulmonary artery runs to the root of the left lung where it divides into two branches one passing into each lobe the right pulmonary artery passes to the root of the right lung and divides into two branches the larger branch carries blood to the middle and lower lobes and the smaller branch to the upper lobe within the lung these arteries divide and subdivide into smaller arteries arterioles and capillaries the interchange of gases takes place between capillary blood and air in the alveoli of the lungs p 255 in each lung the capillaries containing oxygenated blood join up and eventually form two veins two pulmonary veins leave each lung returning oxygenated blood to the left atrium of the heart during atrial systole this blood passes into the left ventricle and during ventricular systole it is forced into the aorta the first artery of the general circulation systemic or general circulation the blood pumped out from the left ventricle is carried by the branches of the aorta around the body and is returned to the right atrium of the heart by the superior and inferior venae cavae figure 532 shows the general positions of the aorta and the main arteries of the limbs figure 533 provides an overview of the venae cavae and the veins of the limbs the circulation of blood to the different parts of the body will be described in the order in which their arteries branch off the aorta aorta the aorta fig 529 begins at the upper part of the left ventricle and after passing upwards for a short way it arches backwards and to the left it then descends behind the heart through the thoracic cavity a little to the left of the thoracic vertebrae at the level of the 12th thoracic vertebra it passes behind the diaphragm then downwards in the abdominal cavity to the level of the 4th lumbar vertebra where it divides into the right and left common iliac arteries throughout its length the aorta gives off numerous branches some of the branches are paired ie there is a right and left branch of the same name for instance the right and left renal arteries supplying the kidneys and some are single or unpaired eg the coeliac artery thoracic aorta this part of the aorta is above the diaphragm and is described in three parts ascending aorta arch of the aorta descending aorta in the thorax ascending aorta this is about 5 cm long and lies behind the sternum the right and left coronary arteries are its only branches and they arise from the aorta just above the level of the aortic valve fig 517 arch of the aorta the arch of the aorta is a continuation of the ascending aorta it begins behind the manubrium of the sternum and runs upwards backwards and to the left in front of the trachea it then passes downwards to the left of the trachea and is continuous with the descending aorta three branches are given off from its upper aspect fig 530 brachiocephalic artery or trunk left common carotid artery left subclavian artery the brachiocephalic artery is about 4 to 5 cm long and passes obliquely upwards backwards and to the right at the level of the sternoclavicular joint it divides into the right common carotid artery and the right subclavian artery circulation of blood to the head and neck arterial supply the paired arteries supplying the head and neck are the common carotid arteries and the vertebral arteries fig 531 carotid arteries the right common carotid artery is a branch of the brachiocephalic artery the left common carotid artery arises directly from the arch of the aorta they pass upwards on either side of the neck and have the same distribution on each side the common carotid arteries are embedded in fascia called the carotid sheath at the level of the upper border of the thyroid cartilage they divide into external carotid artery internal carotid artery the carotid sinuses are slight dilatations at the point of division bifurcation of the common carotid arteries into their internal and external branches the walls of the sinuses are thin and contain numerous nerve endings of the glossopharyngeal nerves these nerve endings or baroreceptors are stimulated by changes in blood pressure in the carotid sinuses the resultant nerve impulses initiate reflex adjustments of blood pressure through the vasomotor centre in the medulla oblongata p 92 the carotid bodies are two small groups of specialised cells called chemoreceptors one lying in close association with each common carotid artery at its bifurcation they are supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerves and their cells are stimulated by changes in the carbon dioxide and oxygen content of blood the resultant nerve impulses initiate reflex adjustments of respiration through the respiratory centre in the medulla oblongata external carotid artery fig 531 this artery supplies the superficial tissues of the head and neck via a number of branches the superior thyroid artery supplies the thyroid gland and adjacent muscles the lingual artery supplies the tongue the lining membrane of the mouth the structures in the floor of the mouth the tonsil and the epiglottis the facial artery passes outwards over the mandible just in front of the angle of the jaw and supplies the muscles of facial expression and structures in the mouth the pulse may be felt where the artery crosses the jaw bone the occipital artery supplies the posterior part of the scalp the temporal artery passes upwards over the zygomatic process in front of the ear and supplies the frontal temporal and parietal parts of the scalp the pulse may be felt in front of the upper part of the ear the maxillary artery supplies the muscles of mastication and a branch of this artery the middle meningeal artery runs deeply to supply structures in the interior of the skull internal carotid artery the internal carotid artery is a major contributor to the circulus arteriosus circle of willis fig 534 which supplies the greater part of the brain it also has branches that supply the eyes forehead and nose it ascends to the base of the skull and passes through the carotid foramen in the temporal bone circulus arteriosus circle of willis the greater part of the brain is supplied with arterial blood by an arrangement of arteries called the circulus arteriosus or the circle of willis fig 534 four large arteries contribute to its formation two internal carotid arteries and two vertebral arteries fig 535 the vertebral arteries arise from the subclavian arteries pass upwards through the foramina in the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae enter the skull through the foramen magnum then join to form the basilar artery the arrangement in the circulus arteriosus circle of willis is such that the brain as a whole receives an adequate blood supply when a contributing artery is damaged and during extreme movements of the head and neck anteriorly two anterior cerebral arteries arise from the internal carotid arteries and are joined by the anterior communicating artery posteriorly two vertebral arteries join to form the basilar artery after travelling for a short distance the basilar artery divides to form two posterior cerebral arteries each of which is joined to the corresponding internal carotid artery by a posterior communicating artery completing the circle the circulus arteriosus is therefore formed by 2 anterior cerebral arteries 2 internal carotid arteries 1 anterior communicating artery 2 posterior communicating arteries 2 posterior cerebral arteries 1 basilar artery from this circle the anterior cerebral arteries pass forward to supply the anterior part of the brain the middle cerebral arteries pass laterally to supply the sides of the brain and the posterior cerebral arteries supply the posterior part of the brain branches of the basilar artery supply parts of the brain stem,the pulse is the palpable sensation of wavelike distension in the artery walls resulting from the left ventricle contracting and ejecting approximately 60 to 80 milliliters of blood into the aorta with each heartbeat this wave can be felt at various points where superficial arteries press against bones serving as an important indicator of heart function the typical resting heart rate ranges from 60 to 80 beats per minute but several key characteristics can be assessed through pulse evaluation rate the number of beats per minute regularity the consistency of the intervals between beats volumestrength the arterys compressibility which provides insights into blood pressure and the condition of the vessel wall tension the pliability of the artery indicating its health blood circulation is divided into two main pathways pulmonary circulation which transports deoxygenated blood to the lungs for oxygenation and systemic circulation which carries oxygenated blood from the left ventricle to the rest of the body the aorta branches into several arteries supplying blood to various organs the circulus arteriosus or circle of willis is a vital arterial structure that ensures the brain receives an adequate blood supply even in the event of an artery blockage
venous return from the head and neck the venous blood from the head and neck is returned by deep and superficial veins superficial veins with the same names as the branches of the external carotid artery return venous blood from the superficial structures of the face and scalp and unite to form the external jugular vein fig 536 the external jugular vein begins in the neck at the level of the angle of the jaw it passes downwards in front of the sternocleidomastoid muscle then behind the clavicle before entering the subclavian vein the venous blood from the deep areas of the brain is collected into channels called the dural venous sinuses the dural venous sinuses of the brain figs 537 and 538 are formed by layers of dura mater lined with endothelium the dura mater is the outer protective covering of the brain p 147 the main venous sinuses are 1 superior sagittal sinus 1 inferior sagittal sinus 1 straight sinus 2 transverse or lateral sinuses 2 sigmoid sinuses the superior sagittal sinus carries the venous blood from the superior part of the brain it begins in the frontal region and passes directly backwards in the midline of the skull to the occipital region where it turns to the right side and continues as the right transverse sinus the inferior sagittal sinus lies deep within the brain and passes backwards to form the straight sinus the straight sinus runs backwards and downwards to become the left transverse sinus the transverse sinuses begin in the occipital region they run forward and medially in a curved groove of the skull to become continuous with the sigmoid sinuses the sigmoid sinuses are a continuation of the transverse sinuses each curves downwards and medially and lies in a groove in the mastoid process of the temporal bone anteriorly only a thin plate of bone separates the sinus from the air cells in the mastoid process of the temporal bone inferiorly it continues as the internal jugular vein the internal jugular veins begin at the jugular foramina in the middle cranial fossa and each is the continuation of a sigmoid sinus they run downwards in the neck behind the sternocleidomastoid muscles behind the clavicle they unite with the subclavian veins carrying blood from the upper limbs to form the brachiocephalic veins the brachiocephalic veins are situated one on each side in the root of the neck each is formed by the union of the internal jugular and the subclavian veins the left brachiocephalic vein is longer than the right and passes obliquely behind the manubrium of the sternum where it joins the right brachiocephalic vein to form the superior vena cava fig 539 the superior vena cava which drains all the venous blood from the head neck and upper limbs is about 7 cm long it passes downwards along the right border of the sternum and ends in the right atrium of the heart circulation of blood to the upper limb arterial supply the subclavian arteries the right subclavian artery arises from the brachiocephalic artery the left branches from the arch of the aorta they are slightly arched and pass behind the clavicles and over the first ribs before entering the axillae where they continue as the axillary arteries fig 540 before entering the axilla each subclavian artery gives off two branches the vertebral artery which passes upwards to supply the brain and the internal thoracic artery which supplies the breast and a number of structures in the thoracic cavity the axillary artery is a continuation of the subclavian artery and lies in the axilla the first part lies deeply then it runs more superficially to become the brachial artery the brachial artery is a continuation of the axillary artery it runs down the medial aspect of the upper arm passes to the front of the elbow and extends to about 1 cm below the joint where it divides into radial and ulnar arteries the radial artery passes down the radial or lateral side of the forearm to the wrist just above the wrist it lies superficially and can be felt in front of the radius where the radial pulse is palpable the artery then passes between the first and second metacarpal bones and enters the palm of the hand the ulnar artery runs downwards on the ulnar or medial aspect of the forearm to cross the wrist and pass into the hand there are anastomoses between the radial and ulnar arteries called the deep and superficial palmar arches from which palmar metacarpal and palmar digital arteries arise to supply the structures in the hand and fingers branches from the axillary brachial radial and ulnar arteries supply all the structures in the upper limb venous return from the upper limb the veins of the upper limb are divided into two groups deep and superficial veins fig 541 the deep veins follows the course of the arteries and have the same names palmar metacarpal veins deep palmar venous arch ulnar and radial veins brachial vein axillary vein subclavian vein the superficial veins begin in the hand and consist of the following cephalic vein basilic vein median vein median cubital vein the cephalic vein begins at the back of the hand where it collects blood from a complex of superficial veins many of which can be easily seen it then winds round the radial side to the anterior aspect of the forearm in front of the elbow it gives off a large branch the median cubital vein which slants upwards and medially to join the basilic vein after crossing the elbow joint the cephalic vein passes up the lateral aspect of the arm and in front of the shoulder joint to end in the axillary vein throughout its length it receives blood from the superficial tissues on the lateral aspects of the hand forearm and arm the basilic vein begins at the back of the hand on the ulnar aspect it ascends on the medial side of the forearm and upper arm then joins the axillary vein it receives blood from the medial aspect of the hand forearm and arm there are many small veins which link the cephalic and basilic veins the median vein is a small vein that is not always present it begins at the palmar surface of the hand ascends on the front of the forearm and ends in the basilic vein or the median cubital vein the brachiocephalic vein is formed when the subclavian and internal jugular veins unite there is one on each side the superior vena cava is formed when the two brachiocephalic veins unite it drains all the venous blood from the head neck and upper limbs and terminates in the right atrium it is about 7 cm long and passes downwards along the right border of the sternum descending aorta in the thorax this part of the aorta is continuous with the arch of the aorta and begins at the level of the 4th thoracic vertebra it extends downwards on the anterior surface of the bodies of the thoracic vertebrae fig 542 to the level of the 12th thoracic vertebra where it passes behind the diaphragm to become the abdominal aorta the descending aorta in the thorax gives off many paired branches which supply the walls of the thoracic cavity and the organs within the cavity including bronchial arteries that supply the bronchi and their branches connective tissue in the lungs and the lymph nodes at the root of the lungs oesophageal arteries that supply the oesophagus intercostal arteries that run along the inferior border of the ribs and supply the intercostal muscles some muscles of the thorax the ribs the skin and its underlying connective tissues venous return from the thoracic cavity most of the venous blood from the organs in the thoracic cavity is drained into the azygos vein and the hemiazygos vein fig 543 some of the main veins which join them are the bronchial oesophageal and intercostal veins the azygos vein joins the superior vena cava and the hemiazygos vein joins the left brachiocephalic vein at the distal end of the oesophagus some oesophageal veins join the azygos vein and others the left gastric vein a venous plexus is formed by anastomoses between the veins joining the azygos vein and those joining the left gastric veins linking the general and portal circulations see fig 1250 p 321 abdominal aorta the abdominal aorta is a continuation of the thoracic aorta the name changes when the aorta enters the abdominal cavity by passing behind the diaphragm at the level of the 12th thoracic vertebra it descends in front of the bodies of the vertebrae to the level of the 4th lumbar vertebra where it divides into the right and left common iliac arteries fig 544 when a branch of the abdominal aorta supplies an organ it is only named here and is described in more detail in association with the organ however illustrations showing the distribution of blood from the coeliac superior and inferior mesenteric arteries are presented here figs 545 and 546 many branches arise from the abdominal aorta some of which are paired and some unpaired paired branches inferior phrenic arteries supply the diaphragm renal arteries supply the kidneys and give off branches the suprarenal arteries to supply the adrenal glands testicular arteries supply the testes in the male ovarian arteries supply the ovaries in the female the testicular and ovarian arteries are much longer than the other paired branches this is because the testes and the ovaries begin their development in the region of the kidneys as they grow they descend into the scrotum and the pelvis respectively and are accompanied by their blood vessels unpaired branches the coeliac artery fig 544 is a short thick artery about 125 cm long it arises immediately below the diaphragm and divides into three branches left gastric artery supplies the stomach splenic artery supplies the pancreas and the spleen hepatic artery supplies the liver gall bladder and parts of the stomach duodenum and pancreas the superior mesenteric artery fig 544 branches from the aorta between the coeliac artery and the renal arteries it supplies the whole of the small intestine and the proximal half of the large intestine the inferior mesenteric artery fig 544 arises from the aorta about 4 cm above its division into the common iliac arteries it supplies the distal half of the large intestine and part of the rectum venous return from the abdominal organs the inferior vena cava is formed when right and left common iliac veins join at the level of the body of the 5th lumbar vertebra this is the largest vein in the body and it conveys blood from all parts of the body below the diaphragm to the right atrium of the heart it passes through the central tendon of the diaphragm at the level of the 8th thoracic vertebra paired testicular ovarian renal and adrenal veins join the inferior vena cava blood from the remaining organs in the abdominal cavity passes through the liver via the portal circulation before entering the inferior vena cava fig 545 portal circulation in all the parts of the circulation which have been described previously venous blood passes from the tissues to the heart by the most direct route through only one capillary bed in the portal circulation venous blood passes from the capillary beds of the abdominal part of the digestive system the spleen and pancreas to the liver it passes through a second capillary bed the hepatic sinusoids in the liver before entering the general circulation via the inferior vena cava in this way blood with a high concentration of nutrients absorbed from the stomach and intestines goes to the liver first in the liver certain modifications take place including the regulation of nutrient supply to other parts of the body portal vein this is formed by the union of the following veins figs 547 and 548 each of which drains blood from the area supplied by the corresponding artery splenic vein inferior mesenteric vein superior mesenteric vein gastric veins cystic vein the splenic vein drains blood from the spleen the pancreas and part of the stomach the inferior mesenteric vein returns the venous blood from the rectum pelvic and descending colon of the large intestine it joins the splenic vein the superior mesenteric vein returns venous blood from the small intestine and the proximal parts of the large intestine ie the caecum ascending and transverse colon it unites with the splenic vein to form the portal vein the gastric veins drain blood from the stomach and the distal end of the oesophagus then join the portal vein the cystic vein which drains venous blood from the gall bladder joins the portal vein hepatic veins these are very short veins that leave the posterior surface of the liver and almost immediately enter the inferior vena cava circulation of blood to the pelvis and lower limb arterial supply common iliac arteries the right and left common iliac arteries are formed when the abdominal aorta divides at the level of the 4th lumbar vertebra fig 532 in front of the sacroiliac joint each divides into internal iliac artery external iliac artery the internal iliac artery runs medially to supply the organs within the pelvic cavity in the female one of the largest branches is the uterine artery which provides the main arterial blood supply to the reproductive organs the external iliac artery runs obliquely downwards and passes behind the inguinal ligament into the thigh where it becomes the femoral artery the femoral artery fig 549 begins at the midpoint of the inguinal ligament and extends downwards in front of the thigh then it turns medially and eventually passes round the medial aspect of the femur to enter the popliteal space where it becomes the popliteal artery it supplies blood to the structures of the thigh and some superficial pelvic and inguinal structures the popliteal artery fig 550 passes through the popliteal fossa behind the knee it supplies the structures in this area including the knee joint at the lower border of the popliteal fossa it divides into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries the anterior tibial artery fig 550 passes forwards between the tibia and fibula and supplies the structures in the front of the leg it lies on the tibia runs in front of the ankle joint and continues over the dorsum top of the foot as the dorsalis pedis artery the dorsalis pedis artery is a continuation of the anterior tibial artery and passes over the dorsum of the foot supplying arterial blood to the structures in this area it ends by passing between the first and second metatarsal bones into the sole of the foot where it contributes to the formation of the plantar arch the posterior tibial artery fig 550 runs downwards and medially on the back of the leg near its origin it gives off a large branch called the peroneal artery which supplies the lateral aspect of the leg in the lower part it becomes superficial and passes medial to the ankle joint to reach the sole of the foot where it continues as the plantar artery the plantar artery supplies the structures in the sole of the foot this artery its branches and the dorsalis pedis artery form the plantar arch from which the digital branches arise to supply the toes venous return there are both deep and superficial veins in the lower limb fig 531 blood entering the superficial veins passes to the deep veins through communicating veins movement of blood towards the heart is partly dependent on contraction of skeletal muscles backward flow is prevented by a large number of valves superficial veins receive less support by surrounding tissues than deep veins deep veins the deep veins accompany the arteries and their branches and have the same names they are digital veins plantar venous arch posterior tibial vein anterior tibial vein popliteal vein femoral vein external iliac vein internal iliac vein common iliac vein the femoral vein ascends in the thigh to the level of the inguinal ligament where it becomes the external iliac vein the external iliac vein is the continuation of the femoral vein where it enters the pelvis lying close to the femoral artery it passes along the brim of the pelvis and at the level of the sacroiliac joint it is joined by the internal iliac vein to form the common iliac vein the internal iliac vein receives tributaries from several veins which drain the organs of the pelvic cavity the two common iliac veins begin at the level of the sacroiliac joints they ascend obliquely and end a little to the right of the body of the 5th lumbar vertebra by uniting to form the inferior vena cava superficial veins fig 551 the two main superficial veins draining blood from the lower limbs are small saphenous vein great saphenous vein the small saphenous vein begins behind the ankle joint where many small veins which drain the dorsum of the foot join together it ascends superficially along the back of the leg and in the popliteal space it joins the popliteal vein a deep vein the great saphenous vein is the longest vein in the body it begins at the medial half of the dorsum of the foot and runs upwards crossing the medial aspect of the tibia and up the inner side of the thigh just below the inguinal ligament it joins the femoral vein many communicating veins join the superficial veins and the superficial and deep veins of the lower limb,venous return from the head and neck involves both deep and superficial veins superficial veins mirroring the branches of the external carotid artery converge to form the external jugular vein which drains into the subclavian vein deep venous blood from the brain is collected in dural venous sinuses including the superior sagittal sinus and inferior sagittal sinus ultimately leading to the internal jugular veins key arterial supply to the upper limbs is provided by the subclavian arteries branching into the axillary and brachial arteries which further divide into radial and ulnar arteries venous return includes deep veins mirroring arterial paths and superficial veins like the cephalic and basilic veins in the thorax the descending aorta supplies paired branches such as bronchial and intercostal arteries while the azygos and hemiazygos veins return blood the abdominal aorta has paired renal ovarian and unpaired branches coeliac mesenteric arteries with the inferior vena cava collecting blood from the lower body including portal circulation from the digestive organs in the pelvis and lower limbs blood supply is through common iliac arteries leading to the femoral artery while venous return includes both deep veins femoral popliteal and superficial veins great and small saphenous
diseases of blood vessels atheroma pathological changes patchy changes atheromatous plaques develop in the tunica intima of large and mediumsized arteries these consist of accumulations of cholesterol and other lipid compounds excess smooth muscle and fatfilled monocytes foam cells the plaque is covered with a fibrous cap as plaques grow they spread along the artery wall forming swellings that protrude into the lumen eventually the whole thickness of the wall and long sections of the vessel may be affected fig 553 plaques may rupture exposing subintimal materials to the blood this may cause thrombosis and vasospasm and will compromise blood flow arteries most commonly involved are those in the heart brain kidneys small intestine and lower limbs causes of atheroma the origin of atheromatous plaques is uncertain fatty streaks present in artery walls of infants are usually absorbed but their incomplete absorption may be the origin of atheromatous plaques in later life atherosclerosis is considered to be a disease of older people because it is usually in these age groups that clinical signs appear plaques however start to form in childhood in developed countries the incidence of atheroma is widespread in developed countries why atheromatous plaques develop is not yet clearly understood but the predisposing factors appear to exert their effects over a long period this may mean that the development of atheroma can be delayed or even arrested by a change in lifestyle predisposing factors include heredity family history gender males are more susceptible than females until after the menopause increasing age hypertension diabetes mellitus smoking especially cigarettes excessive emotional stress in work or home environment diet eg high intake of refined carbohydrates andor cholesterol and saturated fatty acids from animal fats obesity sedentary lifestyle excessive alcohol consumption effects of atheroma arteries may be partially or completely blocked by atheromatous plaques alone or by plaques combined with a thrombus this may reduce or completely block the blood supply the effects depend on the site and size of the artery involved and the extent of collateral circulation commonly the arteries affected are those in the heart abdomen and pelvis narrowing of an artery the tissues distal to the narrow point become ischaemic the cells may receive enough blood to meet their minimum needs but not enough to cope with an increase in metabolic rate eg when muscle activity is increased this causes acute cramplike ischaemic pain cardiac muscle and skeletal muscles of the lower limb are most commonly affected ischaemic pain in the heart is called angina pectoris p 121 and in the lower limbs intermittent claudication occlusion of an artery when an artery is completely blocked the tissues it supplies rapidly undergo degeneration and die from ischaemia which leads to infarction the extent of tissue damage depends on the size of the artery occluded the amount and type of tissue involved the extent of collateral circulation eg in the brain the circulus arteriosus circle of willis provides extensive collateral blood vessels while in the heart there are very few when a coronary artery is occluded myocardial infarction p 121 occurs occlusion of arteries in the brain causes cerebral ischaemia and this leads to cerebral infarction stroke complications of atheroma thrombosis and infarction if the fibrous cap overlying a plaque breaks down platelets are activated by the damaged cells and a blood clot thrombus forms blocking the artery and causing ischaemia and infarction pieces of the clot emboli may break off travel in the bloodstream and lodge in small arteries distal to the clot causing small infarcts areas of dead tissue haemorrhage when calcium salts are deposited in the plaques the artery walls become brittle rigid and unresponsive to rises in blood pressure and may rupture causing haemorrhage aneurysm formation when the arterial wall is weakened by spread of the plaque between the layers of tissue a local dilatation aneurysm may develop see below this may lead to thrombosis and embolism or the aneurysm may rupture causing severe haemorrhage the most common sites affected are the aorta and the abdominal and pelvic arteries arteriosclerosis this is a progressive degeneration of arterial walls associated with ageing and accompanied by hypertension large and medium arteries the tunica media is infiltrated with fibrous tissue and calcium this causes the vessels to lose their elasticity the lumen dilates and they become tortuous fig 554 loss of elasticity increases systolic blood pressure and the pulse pressure the difference between systolic and diastolic pressure small arteries and arterioles hyaline thickening of the tunica media and tunica intima causes narrowing of the lumen and they become tortuous fig 554 these arteries are the main determinants of peripheral resistance p 80 and narrowing of their lumens increases peripheral resistance and blood pressure ischaemia of tissues supplied by affected arteries may occur in the limbs the resultant ischaemia predisposes to gangrene which is particularly serious in people with diabetes mellitus senile arteriosclerosis this is a condition affecting elderly people in which the progressive loss of elasticity and reduced arterial lumen leads to cerebral ischaemia and loss of mental function there may or may not be evidence of hypertension thromboangiitis obliterans buergers disease in this condition there is acute inflammation with thrombosis of the small arteries mainly in the lower limbs it occurs most commonly in men between the ages of 20 and 40 years and is associated with heavy cigarette smoking the condition may be caused by an immune response to an antigen possibly a tobacco protein the condition may become chronic and the vessel walls become f ibrosed lose their elasticity and do not dilate during exercise the individual suffers from acute ischaemic pain and as the disease progresses the distance walked with comfort is gradually reduced in the long term the skin may ulcerate and in extreme cases gangrene may develop,atheroma is a vascular condition marked by the formation of atheromatous plaques in the tunica intima of large and mediumsized arteries these plaques consist of cholesterol lipid deposits smooth muscle cells and foam cells all covered by a fibrous cap as these plaques grow they can protrude into the arterial lumen potentially causing narrowing ischemia that reduces blood flow this can lead to ischemic pain with angina pectoris occurring in the heart and intermittent claudication in the lower limbs complications of atheroma include thrombosis where a blood clot forms on a plaque potentially leading to infarction or tissue death hemorrhage can occur if plaques rupture resulting in severe bleeding additionally weakened arterial walls can develop an aneurysm posing risks of rupture arteriosclerosis refers to the progressive degeneration of arterial walls often associated with aging leading to a loss of elasticity and increased blood pressure thromboangiitis obliterans buergers disease is characterized by inflammation and thrombosis in small arteries primarily affecting young male smokers this condition can cause severe ischemic pain and if untreated may result in skin ulcers or gangrene
polyarteritis nodosa this is a connective tissue disorder associated with inflammation of the tunica media of mediumsized arteries in any part of the body the most common sites are the heart kidneys alimentary tract liver pancreas and nervous system it is acute at first but frequently becomes chronic necrosis and rupture of blood vessels may occur in the acute phase followed by thrombosis ischaemia infarction and death it is believed to be caused by an immune reaction in most cases the antigen is not known but it may be a virus or drug such as a sulphonamide or antibiotic aneurysms aneurysms are abnormal local dilatations of arteries which vary considerably in size fig 555 the causes are not clear but predisposing factors include atheroma hypertension and defective formation of collagen in the arterial wall fusiform or spindleshaped distensions occur mainly in the abdominal aorta and less commonly in the iliac arteries they are usually associated with atheromatous changes saccular aneurysms bulge out on one side of the artery when they occur in the relatively thinwalled arteries of the circulus arteriosus circle of willis in the brain they are sometimes called berry aneurysms they may be associated with defective collagen production with atheromatous changes or be congenital dissecting aneurysms occur mainly in the arch of the aorta due to infiltration of blood between the endothelium and tunica media beginning at a site of endothelial damage microaneurysms are fusiform or saccular aneurysms occurring in small arteries and arterioles in the brain they are associated with hypertension recurring small strokes transient ischaemic attacks are commonly due to thrombosis in the aneurysm or to haemorrhage when an aneurysm ruptures complications of aneurysms haemorrhage a ruptured aneurysm may cause sudden death or disability of varying severity depending on the size and site of the artery pressure localised swelling may cause pressure affecting adjacent tissues including organs blood vessels and nerves thrombosis and embolism a blood clot thrombus may form in an artery where the endothelium has been damaged by an aneurysm a piece of clot embolus may break off and travel in the bloodstream until it lodges in a small artery distal to the aneurysm and obstructs the blood flow causing ischaemia and infarction venous thrombosis this may be superficial thrombophlebitis or deep vein thrombosis superficial thrombophlebitis in this acute inflammatory condition a thrombus forms in a superficial vein and the tissue around the affected vein becomes red and painful the most common causes are intravenous infusion varicosities in the saphenous vein deep vein thrombosis dvt a thrombus forms in a deep vein commonly in the lower limb pelvic or iliac veins but occasionally in an upper limb the thrombus may affect a long section of the vein and after some days fibrinolysis p 68 may enable recanalisation through the blockage deep vein thrombosis may be accompanied by pain and swelling but is often asymptomatic there are several predisposing factors reduced rate of blood flow this may be caused by immobility associated with prolonged bedrest pressure on veins in the popliteal region by eg a pillow under the knees in bed or sitting in a chair for long periods as in long journeys pressure on a vein by an adjacent tumour prolonged low blood pressure as in shock changes in the blood these may trigger intravascular clotting eg increased blood viscosity in eg dehydration polycythaemia p 72 increased adhesiveness of platelets eg associated with the use of some oral contraceptive drugs and in some malignant diseases damage to the blood vessel wall this can result in intravascular clotting eg accidental injury surgery the most common complication of dvt is pulmonary embolism which occurs when a large piece or several small fragments of a venous thrombus become detached and travel through the heart to lodge in the pulmonary artery or one of its branches it causes infarction of lung tissue a massive pulmonary embolism usually causes sudden collapse and death varicose veins a varicosed vein is one which is so dilated that the valves do not close to prevent backward flow of blood such veins lose their elasticity become elongated and tortuous and fibrous tissue replaces the tunica media predisposing factors heredity there appears to be a familial tendency but no abnormal genetic factor has been identified gender females are affected more than males especially following pregnancy age there is progressive loss of elasticity in the vein walls with increasing age so that elastic recoil is less efficient obesity superficial veins in the limbs are supported by subcutaneous areolar tissue excess adipose tissue may not provide sufficient support gravity standing for long periods with little muscle contraction tends to cause pooling of blood in the lower limbs and pelvis pressure because of their thin walls veins are easily compressed by surrounding structures leading to increased venous pressure distal to the site of compression sites and effects of varicose veins varicose veins of the legs when valves in the anastomosing veins between the deep and superficial veins in the legs become incompetent the venous pressure in the superficial veins rises in the long term they stretch and become chronically dilated because the superficial veins are not supported by much tissue such areas are seen externally as varicosities fig 556 the great and small saphenous veins and the anterior tibial veins are most commonly affected causing aching and fatigue of the legs especially during long periods of standing these dilated inelastic veins rupture easily if injured and haemorrhage occurs the skin over a varicose vein may become poorly nourished due to stasis of blood leading to the formation of varicose ulcers usually on the medial aspects of the leg just above the ankle haemorrhoids sustained pressure on the veins at the junction of the rectum and anus leads to increased venous pressure valvular incompetence and the development of haemorrhoids fig 556 the most common causes are chronic constipation and the increased pressure in the pelvis towards the end of pregnancy slight bleeding may occur each time stools are passed and in time may cause anaemia severe haemorrhage is rare scrotal varicocele each spermatic cord is surrounded by a plexus of veins that may become varicosed fig 556 especially in men whose work necessitates standing for long periods if the varicocele is bilateral the increased temperature due to venous congestion may cause depressed spermatogenesis and result in infertility oesophageal varices the veins involved are at the lower end of the oesophagus when the venous pressure in the liver rises there is a rise in pressure in the anastomosing veins between the left gastric vein and the azygos vein sustained pressure causes varicosities to develop in the oesophagus see fig 1250 p 321 the commonest causes of increased portal vein pressure are cirrhosis of the liver and rightsided cardiac failure if the pressure continues to rise inelastic varicosed veins may rupture causing severe haemorrhage and possibly death tumours of blood and lymph vessels angiomas angiomas are benign tumours of either blood vessels haemangiomas or lymph vessels lymphangiomas the latter rarely occur so angioma is usually taken to mean haemangioma haemangiomas these are not true tumours but are sufficiently similar to be classified as such they consist of an excessive growth of blood vessels arranged in an uncharacteristic manner and interspersed with collagen fibres capillary haemangiomas excess capillary growth interspersed with collagen in a localised area makes a dense plexuslike network of tissue each haemangioma is supplied by only one blood vessel and if it thromboses the haemangioma atrophies and disappears capillary haemangiomas are usually present at birth and are seen as a purple or red mole or birthmark they may be quite small at birth but grow at an alarming rate in the first few months keeping pace with the growth of the child after 1 to 3 years atrophy may begin and by the end of 5 years in about 80 of cases the tumours have disappeared cavernous haemangiomas blood vessels larger than capillaries grow in excess of normal needs in a localised area and are interspersed with collagen fibres they are dark red in colour and may be present in the skin though more commonly in the liver they grow slowly do not regress and may become large and unsightly,polyarteritis nodosa is a connective tissue disorder characterized by inflammation of the tunica media in mediumsized arteries commonly affecting the heart kidneys alimentary tract liver pancreas and nervous system it often begins acutely and can become chronic leading to necrosis thrombosis ischemia and potential death the condition may result from an immune reaction possibly triggered by a viral infection or certain drugs aneurysms are abnormal artery dilatations often associated with atheroma hypertension or collagen defects they can be fusiform spindleshaped saccular bulging on one side or dissecting tearing of vessel layers complications include hemorrhage pressure on surrounding tissues and thrombosis leading to embolism venous thrombosis can manifest as superficial thrombophlebitis or deep vein thrombosis dvt dvt is often asymptomatic but can cause pulmonary embolism a severe complication varicose veins result from valve incompetence causing blood pooling especially in the legs other conditions such as hemorrhoids and scrotal varicocele arise from sustained venous pressure angiomas primarily hemangiomas are benign tumors of blood vessels with capillary and cavernous types differing in growth patterns and appearance
thrombosis embolism and infarction a thrombus is an intravascular blood clot causing thrombosis it may partially or completely occlude an artery or vein interfering with the circulation of blood factors which predispose to thrombus formation include an abnormality of the normally smooth endothelium eg ruptured atheromatous plaque abnormal blood flow in a vessel especially venous stasis increased coagulability of the blood if a fragment of thrombus called an embolus becomes detached it travels in the bloodstream until it lodges in and blocks a smaller vessel the tissue supplied by the vessel becomes ischaemic and dies this is infarction an embolus is a mass of any material carried in the bloodstream and large enough to block a blood vessel most emboli consist of fragments of thrombi but other materials include fragments of atheromatous plaques fragments of vegetations from heart valves eg infective endocarditis tumour fragments that may cause metastases amniotic fluid during childbirth fat from extensive bone fractures air iatrogenic or following puncture of a blood vessel in the lung by a broken rib nitrogen in decompression sickness the bends pus from an abscess clumps of platelets with adherent microbes emboli in veins move towards the heart and lodge in the smaller vessels of the lungs or the liver an important cause of metastases in tumours of the alimentary tract those in arteries travel away from the heart and lodge in smaller arteries or arterioles the effects of an embolus are determined by the site and size of the blood vessel occluded not its composition common serious consequences include myocardial infarction p 121 cerebral infarction p 180 pulmonary embolism p 116 oedema in oedema there is excess tissue fluid which causes swelling it may occur in internal organs or in superficial tissues when there is disruption of the mechanisms that maintain homeostasis p 81 sites of oedema when oedema is present in the superficial tissues pitting of the surface may be observed ie an indentation in the skin remains after firm finger pressure has been applied the sites at which superficial oedema is observed may be influenced by gravity and the position of the individual when the individual is in the standing or sitting position the oedema is observed in the lower limbs beginning in the feet and ankles patients on bedrest tend to develop oedema in the sacral area this may be described as dependent oedema in pulmonary oedema venous congestion in the lungs or increased vessel permeability results in accumulation of fluid in the tissue spaces and in the alveoli this reduces the area available for gaseous exchange and results in dyspnoea breathlessness cyanosis and expectoration of frothy sputum the most common causes of pulmonary oedema are cardiac failure inhalation of irritating gases inflammation intravenous infusion of excess fluid causes of oedema increased venous hydrostatic pressure congestion of the venous circulation increases venous hydrostatic pressure reducing the effect of osmotic pressure that draws fluid back into the capillary at the venous end excess fluid then remains in the tissues this may be caused by heart failure kidney disease external pressure on a limb due to eg prolonged sitting or tight garments decreased plasma osmotic pressure when there is depletion of plasma proteins less fluid returns to the circulation at the venous end of the capillary fig 557b causes include acute nephritis when the kidneys excrete protein nephrotic syndrome p 352 liver failure p 335 malnourishment where protein intake is very low impaired lymphatic drainage some fluid returns to the circulation via the lymphatic system and when flow is impaired oedema develops fig 557c causes include malignancy causing blockage of lymph nodes surgical removal of lymph nodes destruction of lymph nodes by chronic inflammation increased small vessel permeability in inflammation p 375 chemical mediators increase small vessel permeability in the affected area plasma proteins then leave the circulation fig 557d and the increased tissue osmotic pressure draws fluid into the area causing swelling of the affected tissue this type of oedema also occurs in allergic reactions eg anaphylaxis asthma hay fever ascites and effusions ascites this is the name given to the accumulation of excess fluid in the peritoneal cavity the most common causes are liver disease p 333 obstruction of lymph vessels in the abdominal cavity acute inflammation pleural effusion this is excess serous fluid in the pleural cavity the most common causes are heart failure due to increased blood pressure in the pulmonary circulation inflammation of the pleural membrane,thrombosis embolism and infarction a thrombus is a blood clot that forms within a blood vessel potentially occluding the flow of blood and leading to thrombosis factors contributing to thrombus formation include abnormalities in the endothelial surface disturbed blood flow such as venous stasis and increased blood coagulability an embolus a fragment of a thrombus can break away and travel through the bloodstream lodging in smaller vessels and causing ischemia which can lead to infarction emboli can consist of various materials including atheromatous plaque fragments tumor fragments fat air or pus the consequences of embolism depend on the size and location of the vessel affected with common serious outcomes including myocardial infarction cerebral infarction and pulmonary embolism edema edema is characterized by the excess accumulation of tissue fluid leading to swelling in internal organs or superficial tissues it can result from various mechanisms disrupting homeostasis such as increased venous hydrostatic pressure decreased plasma osmotic pressure impaired lymphatic drainage and increased small vessel permeability common causes of edema include heart failure kidney disease and inflammation specific conditions like ascites fluid in the peritoneal cavity and pleural effusion fluid in the pleural cavity can also occur due to underlying health issues
diseases of the heart cardiac failure the heart is described as failing when the cardiac output is unable to maintain the circulation of sufficient blood to meet the needs of the body in mild cases cardiac output is adequate at rest and becomes inadequate only when increased cardiac output is required eg in exercise heart failure may affect either side of the heart but since both sides of the heart are part of one circuit when one half of the pump begins to fail it frequently leads to increased strain on and eventual failure of the other half the main clinical manifestations depend on which side of the heart is most affected compensatory mechanisms in heart failure when heart failure happens acutely the body has little time to make compensatory changes but if the heart fails over a period of time the following changes are likely to occur in an attempt to maintain cardiac output and tissue perfusion especially of vital organs the cardiac muscle fibres enlarge and increase in number which makes the walls of the chambers thicker the heart chambers enlarge decreased renal blood flow activates the reninangiotensinaldosterone system p 223 which leads to salt and water retention this increases blood volume and cardiac workload the direct vasoconstrictor action of angiotensin 2 increases peripheral resistance and puts further strain on the failing heart acute cardiac failure a sudden decrease in output of blood from both ventricles causes acute reduction in the oxygen supply to all the tissues recovery from the acute phase may be followed by chronic failure or death may occur due to anoxia of vital centres in the brain the commonest causes are severe damage to an area of cardiac muscle due to ischaemia caused by sudden occlusion of one of the larger coronary arteries by atheroma or atheroma with thrombosis pulmonary embolism acute toxic myocarditis severe cardiac arrhythmia rupture of a heart chamber or valve cusp severe malignant hypertension chronic cardiac failure this develops gradually and in the early stages there may be no symptoms because certain compensatory changes occur as described above when further compensation is not possible there is a gradual decline in myocardial efficiency underlying causes include chronic hypertension myocardial fibrosis valvular disease lung diseases anaemia previous acute cardiac failure degenerative changes of old age rightsided congestive cardiac failure the right ventricle fails when pressure developed within it by the contracting myocardium is less than the force needed to push blood through the lungs when compensation has reached its limit and the ventricle is not emptying completely the right atrium and venae cavae become congested with blood and this is followed by congestion throughout the venous system the organs affected first are the liver spleen and kidneys oedema p 118 of the limbs and ascites excess fluid in the peritoneal cavity usually follow this problem may be caused by increased vascular resistance in the lungs weakness of the myocardium andor stenosis and incompetence of valves in the heart or great vessels resistance to blood flow through the lungs when this is increased the right ventricle has more work to do it may be caused by the formation of fibrous tissue following inflammation or chronic disease of the lungs back pressure of blood from the left side of the heart eg in left ventricular failure when the mitral valve is stenosed andor incompetent weakness of the myocardium this may be caused by ischaemia following numerous small myocardial infarcts leftsided or left ventricular failure this occurs when the pressure developed in the left ventricle by the contracting myocardium is less than the pressure in the aorta and the ventricle cannot then pump out all the blood it receives causes include excessively high systemic aortic blood pressure incompetence of the mitral andor the aortic valve aortic valve stenosis myocardial weakness failure of the left ventricle leads to dilatation of the atrium and an increase in pulmonary blood pressure this is followed by a rise in the blood pressure in the right side of the heart and eventually systemic venous congestion congestion in the lungs leads to pulmonary oedema and dyspnoea often most severe at night this paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea may be due to raised blood volume as fluid from peripheral oedema is reabsorbed when the patient slips down in bed during sleep,cardiac failure cardiac failure occurs when the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the bodys needs this can affect either the left or right side of the heart leading to various symptoms based on which side fails compensatory mechanisms in response to heart failure the body may adapt through hypertrophy enlargement of cardiac muscle fibers and heart chambers fluid retention activation of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system increases blood volume putting additional strain on the heart types of cardiac failure acute cardiac failure a sudden decrease in blood output can lead to tissue oxygen deprivation common causes include severe ischemic damage and arrhythmias chronic cardiac failure develops gradually with symptoms often absent initially causes include chronic hypertension and degenerative changes rightsided heart failure occurs when the right ventricle struggles to pump blood through the lungs leading to systemic congestion and fluid accumulation in the abdomen and limbs leftsided heart failure happens when the left ventricle cannot effectively eject blood into the aorta causing pulmonary congestion and breathing difficulties particularly at night
disorders of heart valves the heart valves prevent backflow of blood in the heart during the cardiac cycle the left atrioventricular and aortic valves are subject to greater pressures than those on the right side and are therefore more susceptible to damage distinctive heart sounds arise when the valves close during the cardiac cycle p 88 damaged valves generate abnormal heart sounds called murmurs a severe valve disorder results in heart failure the most common causes of valve defects are rheumatic fever fibrosis following inflammation and congenital abnormalities stenosis this is the narrowing of a valve opening impeding blood flow through the valve it occurs when inflammation and encrustations roughen the edges of the cusps so that they stick together narrowing the valve opening when healing occurs fibrous tissue is formed which shrinks as it ages increasing the stenosis and leading to incompetence incompetence sometimes called regurgitation this is a functional defect caused by failure of a valve to close completely allowing blood to flow back into the ventricle when it relaxes ischaemic heart disease ischaemic heart disease is due to the effects of atheroma causing narrowing or occlusion of one or more branches of the coronary arteries the narrowing is caused by atheromatous plaques p 112 occlusion may be by plaques alone or plaques complicated by thrombosis the overall effect depends on the size of the coronary artery involved and whether it is narrowed or occluded narrowing of an artery leads to angina pectoris and occlusion to myocardial infarction ie an area of dead tissue when atheroma develops slowly a collateral arterial blood supply may have time to develop and effectively supplement or replace the original this consists of the dilatation of normally occurring anastomotic arteries joining adjacent branch arteries when sudden severe narrowing or occlusion of an artery occurs the anastomotic arteries dilate but may not be able to supply enough blood to meet the needs of the myocardium angina pectoris this is sometimes called angina of effort because increased cardiac output required during extra physical effort causes severe ischaemic pain in the chest the pain may also radiate to the arms neck and jaw other factors which may precipitate angina include cold weather exercising after a heavy meal strong emotions a narrowed coronary artery may supply sufficient blood to the myocardium to meet its needs during rest or moderate exercise but not when greatly increased cardiac output is needed eg walking may be tolerated but not running the thick inflexible atheromatous artery wall is unable to dilate to allow for the increased blood flow needed by the more active myocardium which then becomes ischaemic in the early stages of development of the disease the chest pain stops when the cardiac output returns to its resting level soon after the extra effort stops myocardial infarction an infarct is an area of tissue that has died because of lack of oxygenated blood p 117 the myocardium is affected when a branch of a coronary artery is occluded the commonest cause is an atheromatous plaque complicated by thrombosis the extent of myocardial damage depends on the size of the blood vessel and site of the infarct the damage is permanent because cardiac muscle cannot regenerate and the dead tissue is replaced with nonfunctional fibrous tissue speedy restoration of blood flow through the blocked artery using clotdissolving thrombolytic drugs can greatly reduce the extent of the permanent damage and improve prognosis but treatment must be started within a few hours of the infarction occurring the effects and complications are greatest when the left ventricle is involved myocardial infarction is usually accompanied by very severe crushing chest pain behind the sternum which unlike angina pectoris continues even when the individual is at rest complications these may be fatal and include severe arrhythmias especially ventricular fibrillation due to disruption of the cardiac conducting system cardiac failure caused by impaired contraction of the damaged myocardium and in severe cases cardiogenic shock rupture of a ventricle wall usually within 2 weeks of the original episode pulmonary or cerebral embolism originating from a mural clot within a ventricle ie a clot that forms inside the heart over the area of dead tissue pericarditis angina pectoris recurrence rheumatic heart disease rheumatic fever this autoimmune disease occurs 2 to 4 weeks after a throat infection caused by streptococcus pyogenes betahaemolytic group a the antibodies developed to combat the infection damage the heart the microbes are not present in the heart lesion and the same infection in other parts of the body is very rarely followed by rheumatic fever how the antibodies damage the heart is not yet understood children and young adults are most commonly affected death rarely occurs in the acute phase but after recovery there may be permanent damage to the heart valves eventually leading to disability and possibly cardiac failure effects on the endocardium the endocardium becomes inflamed and oedematous and tiny pale areas called aschoffs bodies appear which when they heal leave thick fibrous tissue thrombotic fibrous nodules consisting of platelets and fibrin form on the free borders of the cusps of the heart valves when healing occurs the fibrous tissue formed shrinks as it ages distorting the shape of the cusps and causing stenosis and incompetence of the valve the mitral and aortic valves are commonly affected the tricuspid valve sometimes and the pulmonary valve rarely effects on the myocardium aschoffs bodies form on the connective tissue between the cardiac muscle fibres as in the endocardium healing is accompanied by fibrosis which may interfere with myocardial contraction effects on the pericardium inflammation leads to the accumulation of exudate in the pericardial cavity healing is accompanied by fibrous thickening of the pericardium and adhesions form between the two layers in severe cases the layers may fuse obliterating the cavity within this inelastic pericardium the heart may not be able to expand fully during diastole leading to reduced cardiac output generalised venous congestion and oedema sydenhams chorea this usually occurs between the ages of 5 and 15 years the causes are unknown but it is commonly associated with streptococcal throat infection rheumatic fever or endocarditis there are rapid uncoordinated involuntary muscle movements in mild cases recovery takes place within about 4 weeks in some cases the initial recovery may be followed by recurrences choreiform movements may occasionally occur during pregnancy in women taking contraceptive pills and following cerebrovascular lesions especially in the elderly subclinical rheumatic heart disease valvular incompetence developing in older people who have a history of rheumatic fever many years previously is believed to be due to repeated subclinical attacks these attacks are not associated with repeated episodes of sore throat so it is assumed that the original disease has remained active in a subclinical form in some cases there is no history of rheumatic fever,heart valve disorders play a crucial role in maintaining proper blood flow within the heart these disorders can lead to conditions such as stenosis where the valve opening narrows impeding blood flow and incompetence or regurgitation which occurs when a valve fails to close completely allowing blood to flow backward the most common causes of valve damage include rheumatic fever fibrosis due to inflammation and congenital abnormalities ischaemic heart disease results from the formation of atheroma fatty deposits in the coronary arteries leading to narrowing or blockage this can cause angina pectoris characterized by chest pain during physical exertion due to reduced blood supply and myocardial infarction where a part of the heart muscle dies from lack of oxygenated blood this condition typically presents with severe chest pain and can lead to serious complications including arrhythmias and heart failure rheumatic fever is an autoimmune disease triggered by a streptococcal throat infection leading to inflammation of the heart tissues particularly the endocardium and myocardium this can cause permanent valve damage and various longterm complications additionally conditions like sydenhams chorea involving involuntary movements may arise postinfection highlighting the systemic effects of rheumatic fever
infective endocarditis pathogenic organisms in the blood may colonise any part of the endocardium but the most common sites are on or near the heart valves and round the margins of congenital heart defects these areas are susceptible to infection because they are exposed to fastflowing blood that may cause mild trauma the main predisposing factors are bacteraemia depressed immune response and heart abnormalities bacteraemia microbes may or may not multiply while in the bloodstream and if not destroyed by phagocytes or antibodies they tend to adhere to platelets and form tiny infected emboli inside the heart the emboli are most likely to settle on already damaged endocardium vegetations consisting of platelets and fibrin surround the microbes and seem to protect them from normal body defences and antibiotics because of this infection may be caused by a wide range of microbes including some of low pathogenicity eg nonhaemolytic streptococci eg following tooth extraction tonsillectomy escherichia coli and other normal bowel inhabitants eg following intestinal surgery staphylococcus aureus eg from boils and carbuncles microbes from infections of eg the biliary urinary respiratory tracts microbes accidentally introduced during medical and nursing procedures eg cystoscopy bladder catheterisation arterial and venous cannulation surgery wound dressing lowvirulence microbes that cause infection in people with reduced immune response depressed immune response this enables lowvirulence bacteria viruses yeasts and fungi to become established and cause infection these are organisms always present in the body and the environment depression of the immune systems may be caused by cytotoxic drugs ionising radiation eg xrays used in cancer treatment antiinflammatory drugs eg corticosteroids malignant diseases eg leukaemia tumours of lymphoid tissue sharing of syringes by drug addicts spreading human immunodeficiency virus hiv heart abnormalities the sites most commonly infected are already abnormal in some way eg valve cusps damaged by earlier attacks of rheumatic fever endothelium damaged by the fast flow of blood through a narrow opening such as a stenosed valve or congenital septal defect acute infective endocarditis this is a severe febrile illness usually caused by highvirulence microbes commonly stophylococcus aureus vegetations grow rapidly and pieces may break off becoming infected emboli these settle in other organs where the microbes grow destroying tissue and forming pus the effects depend on the organ involved eg brain or kidney infection may cause death in a few days the causative microbes rapidly destroy heart valves impairing their function and resulting in acute heart failure subacute infective endocarditis this endocarditis is usually caused by lowvirulence microbes eg nonhaemolytic streptococci or some staphylococci infected emboli may settle in any organ but do not cause suppuration and rarely cause death microbes in the vegetations seem to be protected by surrounding platelets and fibrin from normal body defences and antibiotics healing by fibrosis further distorts the shape of the valve cusps increasing the original stenosis and incompetence heart failure may develop later cardiac arrhythmias the heart rate is normally initiated by intrinsic impulses generated in the sa node the rhythm is determined by the route of impulse transmission through the conducting system the heart rate is usually measured as the pulse but to determine the rhythm an electrocardiogram ecg is required fig 558a a cardiac arrhythmia is any disorder of heart rate or rhythm and is the result of abnormal generation or conduction of impulses the normal cardiac cycle p 88 gives rise to normal sinus rhythm which has a rate between 60 and 100 beats per minute sinus bradycardia this is sinus rhythm below 60 beats per minute this may occur during sleep and is common in athletes it is an abnormality when it follows myocardial infarction or accompanies raised intracranial pressure p 177 sinus tachycardia this is sinus rhythm above 100 beats per minute when the individual is at rest this accompanies exercise and anxiety but is an indicator of some disorders eg fever hyperthyroidism some cardiac conditions asystole this occurs when there is no electrical activity in the ventricles and therefore no cardiac output the ecg shows a flat line fig 558b ventricular fibrillation and asystole cause sudden and complete loss of cardiac output ie cardiac arrest and death fibrillation this is the contraction of the cardiac muscle fibres in a disorderly sequence the chambers do not contract as a whole and the pumping action is disrupted in atrial fibrillation contraction of the atria is uncoordinated and rapid pumping is ineffective and stimulation of the av node is disorderly ventricular contraction becomes rapid and rhythm and force irregular although an adequate cardiac output and blood pressure may be maintained the pulse is irregular the causes of increased excitability and disorganised activity are not always clear but predisposing conditions include ischaemic heart disease degenerative changes in the heart due to old age thyrotoxicosis rheumatic heart disease in ventricular fibrillation there is disorganised and very rapid contraction causing disruption of ventricular function blood is not pumped from the heart into either the pulmonary or the systemic circulation no pulses can be felt consciousness is lost and breathing stops the ecg shows an irregular chaotic trace with no recognisable wave pattern fig 558b if normal heart action cannot be restored quickly death follows due to cerebral anoxia heart block heart block occurs when impulse formation is impaired or conduction is prevented and the delay between atrial and ventricular contraction is increased the severity depends on the extent of loss of stimulation of the av node in complete heart block ventricular contraction is entirely independent of impulses initiated by the sa node impulses generated by the av node result in slow regular ventricular contractions and a heart rate of about 30 to 40 beats per minute in this state the heart is unable to respond quickly to a sudden increase in demand by eg muscular exercise the most common causes are acute ischaemic heart disease myocardial fibrosis following repeated infarctions or myocarditis drugs used to treat heart disease eg digitalis propranolol when heart block develops gradually there is some degree of adjustment in the body to reduced cardiac output but if progressive it eventually leads to death from cardiac failure and cerebral anoxia,infective endocarditis is an infection of the hearts inner lining often affecting the heart valves particularly in areas exposed to high blood flow which may cause trauma the main predisposing factors include bacteraemia presence of bacteria in the bloodstream a depressed immune response and preexisting heart abnormalities bacteraemia occurs when microbes often from dental procedures or other infections enter the bloodstream and adhere to damaged endocardial surfaces forming vegetations that shield them from the immune system a depressed immune response allows lowvirulence organisms to establish infections often triggered by factors such as cytotoxic drugs or shared syringes among drug users heart abnormalities including previously damaged valves create favorable conditions for infection acute infective endocarditis is severe typically caused by highvirulence organisms like staphylococcus aureus leading to rapid tissue destruction in contrast subacute infective endocarditis is usually due to lowvirulence microbes and results in slower less severe infections that can still cause heart failure cardiac arrhythmias encompass various irregular heart rhythms including bradycardia tachycardia and fibrillation leading to disrupted blood flow heart block occurs when electrical impulses are impaired resulting in inefficient heart contractions
congenital abnormalities abnormalities in the heart and great vessels at birth may be due to intrauterine developmental errors or to the failure of the heart and blood vessels to adapt to extrauterine life sometimes there are no symptoms in early life and the abnormality is recognised only when complications appear patent ductus arteriosus before birth the ductus arteriosus joining the arch of the aorta and the pulmonary artery allows blood to pass from the pulmonary artery to the aorta fig 559 it carries blood pumped into the pulmonary trunk by the right ventricle into the aorta bypassing the pulmonary circulation at birth when the pulmonary circulation is established the ductus arteriosus should close completely if it remains patent blood regurgitates from the aorta to the pulmonary artery where the pressure is lower reducing the volume entering the systemic circulation and increasing the volume of blood in the pulmonary circulation this leads to pulmonary congestion and eventually cardiac failure atrial septal defect before birth most oxygenated blood from the placenta enters the left atrium from the right atrium through the foramen ovale in the septum there is a valvelike structure across the opening consisting of two partly overlapping membranes the valve is open when the pressure in the right atrium is higher than in the left this diverts blood flow from the right to the left side of the heart bypassing the pulmonary circulation after birth when the pulmonary circulation is established and the pressure in the left atrium is the higher the two membranes come in contact closing the valve later the closure becomes permanent due to fibrosis fig 560 when the membranes do not overlap an opening between the atria remains patent after birth in many cases it is too small to cause symptoms in early life but they may appear later in severe cases blood flows back to the right atrium from the left this increases the right ventricular and pulmonary pressure causing hypertrophy of the myocardium and eventually cardiac failure as pressure in the right atrium rises blood flow through the defect may be reversed but this is not an improvement because deoxygenated blood gains access to the general circulation coarctation of the aorta the most common site of coarctation narrowing of the aorta is between the left subclavian artery and ductus arteriosus this leads to hypertension in the upper body which is supplied by arteries arising from the aorta proximal to the narrowing because increased force of contraction of the heart is needed to push the blood through the coarctation there is hypotension in the rest of the body fallots tetralogy a characteristic combination of four congenital cardiac abnormalities called the tetralogy of fallot causes cyanosis growth retardation and exercise intolerance in babies and young children the four abnormalities are stenosis of the pulmonary artery at its point of origin which increases right ventricular workload ventricular septal defect ie an abnormal communicating hole between the two ventricles just below the atrioventricular valves aortic misplacement ie the origin of the aorta is displaced to the right so that it is immediately above the septal defect right ventricular hypertrophy to counteract the pulmonary stenosis cardiac function is inadequate to meet the needs of the growing child surgical correction carries a good prognosis,congenital abnormalities of the heart and great vessels arise from intrauterine developmental errors or failures to adapt after birth often these defects remain asymptomatic until complications develop patent ductus arteriosus pda occurs when the ductus arteriosus fails to close after birth allowing blood to flow from the aorta back into the pulmonary artery this leads to increased pulmonary blood flow pulmonary congestion and potential heart failure atrial septal defect asd is a condition where the foramen ovale which should close after birth remains open this can result in blood shunting from the left atrium to the right leading to right atrial enlargement and eventual heart failure as pressure rises coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing typically located between the left subclavian artery and the ductus arteriosus resulting in high blood pressure in the upper body and low blood pressure in the lower body requiring the heart to work harder fallots tetralogy encompasses four defects pulmonary artery stenosis ventricular septal defect aortic misplacement and right ventricular hypertrophy this condition can lead to cyanosis and exercise intolerance in children but has a favorable prognosis with surgical intervention
disorders of blood pressure hypertension the term hypertension is used to describe blood pressure that is sustained at a higher than the generally accepted normal maximum level for a particular age group eg at 20years14090mmhg at 50years16095mmhg at 75 years 170105 mmhg arteriosclerosis p 114 contributes to increasing blood pressure with age but is not the only factor involved hypertension is described as essential primary idiopathic or secondary to other diseases irrespective of the cause hypertension commonly affects the kidneys p 353 essential hypertension this means hypertension of unknown cause it accounts for 85 to 90 of all cases and is subdivided according to the rate at which the disease progresses benign chronic hypertension the rise in blood pressure is usually slight to moderate and continues to rise slowly over many years sometimes complications are the first indication of hypertension eg heart failure cerebrovascular accident myocardial infarction occasionally the rate of progress increases and the hypertension becomes malignant predisposing factors include inherited tendency obesity excessive alcohol intake cigarette smoking lack of exercise malignant accelerated hypertension the blood pressure is already elevated and continues to rise rapidly over a few months diastolic pressure in excess of 120 mmhg is common the effects are serious and quickly become apparent eg haemorrhages into the retina papilloedema oedema around the optic disc encephalopathy cerebral oedema and progressive renal disease leading to cardiac failure secondary hypertension hypertension resulting from other diseases accounts for 10 to 15 of all cases kidney diseases raised blood pressure is a complication of many kidney diseases the vasoconstrictor effect of excess renin released by damaged kidneys is one causative factor but there may be others as yet unknown endocrine disorders adrenal cortex secretion of excess aldosterone and cortisol stimulates the retention of excess sodium and water by the kidneys raising the blood volume and pressure oversecretion of aldosterone conns syndrome is due to a hormonesecreting tumour oversecretion of cortisol may be due to overstimulation of the gland by adrenocorticotrophic hormone secreted by the pituitary gland or to a hormonesecreting tumour adrenal medulla secretion of excess adrenaline and noradrenaline raises blood pressure eg phaeochromocytoma p 234 stricture of the aorta hypertension develops in branching arteries proximal to the site of a stricture in congenital coarctation the stricture is between the ductus arteriosus and the left subclavian artery causing hypertension in the head neck and right arm compression of the aorta by an adjacent tumour may cause hypertension proximal to the stricture hypertension may be a complication of some drug treatment eg corticosteroids nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs oral contraceptives effects and complications of hypertension the effects of longstanding and progressively rising blood pressure are serious hypertension predisposes to atherosclerosis and has specific effects on particular organs heart the rate and force of cardiac contraction are increased to maintain the cardiac output against a sustained rise in arterial pressure the left ventricle hypertrophies and begins to fail when compensation has reached its limit this is followed by back pressure and accumulation of blood in the lungs pulmonary congestion hypertrophy of the right ventricle and eventually to right ventricular failure hypertension also predisposes to ischaemic heart disease p 121 and aneurysm formation p 114 brain stroke caused by cerebral haemorrhage is common the effects depending on the position and size of the ruptured vessel when a series of small blood vessels rupture eg microaneurysms at different times there is progressive disability rupture of a large vessel causes extensive loss of function or possibly death hypertensive encephalopathy hypertensive encephalopathy is a rare condition in which hypertension is accompanied by neurological disturbance eg papilloedema difficulty with speech paraesthesia convulsions and loss of consciousness it is usually reversed when hypertension is controlled kidneys essential hypertension causes kidney damage if sustained for only a short time recovery may be complete otherwise the kidney damage causes further hypertension owing to activation of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system p 223 progressive loss of kidney function and kidney failure pulmonary hypertension raised blood pressure in the pulmonary circulation is secondary to changes in blood vessels described above chronic diseases of the respiratory system diseases of the heart eg congenital defects of the septum stenosis and incompetence of the mitral or aortic valve heart failure diseases of other organs that cause raised pressure in the left side of the heart eg cirrhosis of the liver thrombosis of the portal vein hypotension this usually occurs as a complication of other conditions eg shock p 1ll addisons disease p 233 low blood pressure leads to inadequate blood supply to the brain depending on the cause unconsciousness may be brief fainting or more prolonged possibly causing death postural hypotension syncope fainting is due to sudden reduction in blood pressure on standing up quickly from a sitting or lying position it occurs most commonly in the elderly it may be caused by delay in response of the baroreceptors in the carotid sinuses to the gravitational effects of standing up it may also occur when patients are being treated with antihypertensive drugs especially when the most appropriate dose is being established,hypertension is the condition of having blood pressure consistently above normal levels defined as 14090 mmhg at age 20 16095 mmhg at age 50 and 170105 mmhg at age 75 it can be categorized as essential hypertension this is hypertension with no identifiable cause accounting for 8590 of cases it may progress to benign hypertension a gradual increase in blood pressure over many years malignant hypertension rapid elevation of blood pressure often exceeding 120 mmhg diastolic leading to severe complications like retinal hemorrhages and kidney failure secondary hypertension this results from underlying conditions such as kidney diseases endocrine disorders like excess aldosterone and cortisol and aortic stricture effects and complications of hypertension include heart left ventricular hypertrophy leading to heart failure brain increased risk of stroke and hypertensive encephalopathy characterized by neurological disturbances kidneys damage that can cause progressive loss of function and kidney failure pulmonary hypertension elevated pressure in the pulmonary circulation linked to heart and lung diseases hypotension or low blood pressure can result from conditions like shock and addisons disease it may cause fainting particularly in the elderly
the lymphatic system communication all body tissues are bathed in tissue fluid consisting of the diffusible constituents of blood and waste materials from cells some tissue fluid returns to the capillaries at their venous end and the remainder diffuses through the more permeable walls of the lymph capillaries and becomes lymph lymph passes through vessels of increasing size and a varying number of lymph nodes before returning to the blood the lymphatic system fig 61 consists of lymph lymph vessels lymph nodes lymph organs eg spleen and thymus diffuse lymphoid tissue eg tonsils bone marrow functions of the lymphatic system include the following tissue drainage every day around 21 litres of plasma fluid carrying dissolved substances and some plasma protein escape from the arterial end of the capillaries and into the tissues most of this fluid is returned directly to the bloodstream via the capillary at its venous end but 34 litres of fluid are drained away by the lymphatic vessels without this the tissues would rapidly become waterlogged and the cardiovascular system would begin to fail as the blood volume falls absorption in the small intestine fat and fatsoluble materials eg the fatsoluble vitamins are absorbed into the central lacteals lymphatic vessels of the villi immunity the lymphatic organs are concerned with the production and maturation of lymphocytes the white blood cells that are primarily responsible for provision of immunity bone marrow is therefore considered to be lymphatic tissue since lymphocytes are produced there lymph lymph is a clear watery fluid similar in composition to plasma with the important exception of plasma proteins and identical in composition to interstitial fluid lymph transports the plasma proteins that seep out of the capillary beds back to the bloodstream it also carries away larger particles eg bacteria and cell debris from damaged tissues which can then be filtered out and destroyed by the lymph nodes lymph contains lymphocytes which circulate in the lymphatic system allowing them to patrol the different regions of the body in the lacteals of the small intestine fats absorbed into the lymphatics give the lymph now called chyle a milky appearance lymph vessels lymph capillaries these originate as blindend tubes in the interstitial spaces fig 62 they have the same structure as blood capillaries ie a single layer of endothelial cells but their walls are more permeable to all interstitial fluid constituents including proteins and cell debris the tiny capillaries join up to form larger lymph vessels all tissues of the body have a network of lymphatic vessels with the exception of the central nervous system the bones and the most superficial layers of the skin larger lymph vessels the walls of lymph vessels are about the same thickness as those of small veins and have the same layers of tissue ie a fibrous covering a middle layer of smooth muscle and elastic tissue and an inner lining of endothelium lymph vessels have numerous cupshaped valves which ensure that lymph flows in one way only ie towards the thorax fig 63 there is no pump like the heart involved in the onward movement of lymph but the muscle tissue in the walls of the large lymph vessels has an intrinsic ability to contract rhythmically the lymphatic pump in addition any structure that periodically compresses the lymphatic vessels can assist in the movement of lymph along the vessels commonly including the contraction of adjacent muscles and the pulsation of large arteries lymph vessels become larger as they join together eventually forming two large ducts the thoracic duct and right lymphatic duct that empty lymph into the subclavian veins thoracic duct this duct begins at the cisterna chyli which is a dilated lymph channel situated in front of the bodies of the first two lumbar vertebrae the duct is about 40 cm long and opens into the left subclavian vein in the root of the neck it drains lymph from both legs the pelvic and abdominal cavities the left half of the thorax head and neck and the left arm fig 61 a and b right lymphatic duct this is a dilated lymph vessel about 1 cm long it lies in the root of the neck and opens into the right subclavian vein it drains lymph from the right half of the thorax head and neck and the right arm fig 61 a and b,the lymphatic system is an essential network that aids in fluid balance fat absorption and immune function it consists of lymph a clear fluid similar to plasma but lacking plasma proteins it carries nutrients waste and lymphocytes white blood cells and can transport larger particles like bacteria in the small intestine absorbed fats give lymph a milky appearance known as chyle lymph vessels these vessels begin as lymph capillaries in interstitial spaces which are more permeable than blood capillaries allowing them to collect excess tissue fluid larger lymph vessels have walls similar to veins contain valves to ensure unidirectional flow and rely on rhythmic contractions the lymphatic pump and nearby muscle movements to propel lymph toward larger ducts lymph ducts thoracic duct the largest duct about 40 cm long drains lymph from the left side of the body including both legs and the left arm into the left subclavian vein right lymphatic duct a shorter duct that drains lymph from the right side of the body into the right subclavian vein the lymphatic system plays a crucial role in draining excess tissue fluid approximately 34 liters daily facilitating fat absorption in the small intestine and supporting immune function through lymphocyte production in lymphatic organs like the spleen thymus and bone marrow
lymphatic organs and tissues lymph nodes lymph nodes are oval or beanshaped organs that lie often in groups along the length of lymph vessels the lymph drains through a number of nodes usually 8 to 10 before returning to the venous circulation these nodes vary considerably in size some are as small as a pin head and the largest are about the size of an almond structure of lymph nodes lymph nodes fig 64 have an outer capsule of fibrous tissue which dips down into the node substance forming partitions or tmbeculae the main substance of the node consists of reticular and lymphatic tissue containing many lymphocytes and macrophages as many as four or five afferent lymph vessels may enter a lymph node while only one efferent vessel carries lymph away from the node each node has a concave surface called the hilum where an artery enters and a vein and the efferent lymph vessel leave the large numbers of lymph nodes situated in strategic positions throughout the body are arranged in deep and superficial groups lymph from the head and neck passes through deep and superficial cervical nodes fig 65 lymph from the upper limbs passes through nodes situated in the elbow region then through the deep and superficial axillary nodes lymph from organs and tissues in the thoracic cavity drains through groups of nodes that are situated close to the mediastinum large airways oesophagus and chest wall most of the lymph from the breast passes through the axillary nodes lymph from the pelvic and abdominal cavities passes through many lymph nodes before entering the cisterna chyli the abdominal and pelvic nodes are situated mainly in association with the blood vessels supplying the organs and close to the main arteries ie the aorta and the external and internal iliac arteries the lymph from the lower limbs drains through deep and superficial nodes including groups of nodes behind the knee and in the groin inguinal nodes functions of lymph nodes filtering and phagocytosis lymph is filtered by the reticular and lymphoid tissue as it passes through lymph nodes particulate matter may include microbes dead and live phagocytes containing ingested microbes cells from malignant tumours wornout and damaged tissue cells and inhaled particles organic material is destroyed in lymph nodes by macrophages and antibodies some inorganic inhaled particles cannot be destroyed by phagocytosis these remain inside the macrophages either causing no damage or killing the cell material not filtered off and dealt with in one lymph node passes on to successive nodes and by the time lymph enters the blood it has usually been cleared of foreign matter and cell debris in some cases where phagocytosis of microbes is incomplete they may stimulate inflammation and enlargement of the node lymphadenopathy proliferation of lymphocytes activated t and blymphocytes multiply in lymph nodes antibodies produced by sensitised blymphocytes enter lymph and blood draining the node spleen the spleen fig 66 is formed by reticular and lymphatic tissue and is the largest lymph organ the spleen lies in the left hypochondriac region of the abdominal cavity between the fundus of the stomach and the diaphragm it is purplish in colour and varies in size in different individuals but is usually about 12 cm long 7 cm wide and 25 cm thick it weighs about 200 g organs associated with the spleen superiorly and posteriorly diaphragm inferiorly left colic flexure of the large intestine anteriorly fundus of the stomach medially pancreas and the left kidney laterally separated from the 9th 10th and llth ribs and the intercostal muscles by the diaphragm structure fig 67 the spleen is slightly oval in shape with the hilum on the lower medial border the anterior surface is covered with peritoneum it is enclosed in a fibroelastic capsule that dips into the organ forming trabeculae the cellular material consisting of lymphocytes and macrophages is called splenic pulp and it lies between the trabeculae red pulp is the part suffused with blood and white pulp consists of areas of lymphatic tissue where there are sleeves of lymphocytes and macrophages around blood vessels the structures entering and leaving the spleen at the hilum are splenic artery a branch of the coeliac artery splenic vein a branch of the portal vein lymph vessels efferent only nerves blood passing through the spleen flows in sinuses which have distinct pores between the endothelial cells allowing it to come into close association with splenic pulp functions phagocytosis as described previously p 64 old and abnormal erythrocytes are destroyed in the spleen and the breakdown products bilirubin and iron are passed to the liver via the splenic and portal veins other cellular material eg leukocytes platelets and microbes are phagocytosed in the spleen unlike lymph nodes the spleen has no afferent lymphatics entering it so it is not exposed to diseases spread by lymph storage of blood the spleen contains up to 350 ml of blood and in response to sympathetic stimulation can rapidly return a large part of this volume to the circulation eg in haemorrhage immune response the spleen contains t and blymphocytes which are activated by the presence of antigens eg in infection lymphocyte proliferation during serious infection can cause enlargement of the spleen splenomegaly erythropoiesis the spleen and liver are important sites of fetal blood cell production and the spleen can also fulfil this function in adults in times of great need thymus gland the thymus gland lies in the upper part of the mediastinum behind the sternum and extends upwards into the root of the neck fig 68 it weighs about 10 to 15 g at birth and grows until the individual reaches puberty when it begins to atrophy its maximum weight at puberty is between 30 and 40 g and by middle age it has returned to approximately its weight at birth organs associated with the thymus anteriorly sternum and upper four costal cartilages posteriorly aortic arch and its branches brachiocephalic veins trachea laterally lungs superiorly structures in the root of the neck inferiorly heart structure the thymus consists of two lobes joined by areolar tissue the lobes are enclosed by a fibrous capsule which dips into their substance dividing them into lobules that consist of an irregular branching framework of epithelial cells and lymphocytes function lymphocytes originate from pluripotent stem cells in red bone marrow those that enter the thymus develop into activated tlymphocytes p 379 thymic processing produces mature tlymphocytes that can distinguish self tissue from foreign tissue and also provides each tlymphocyte with the ability to react to only one specific antigen from the millions it will encounter p 374 tlymphocytes then leave the thymus and enter the blood some enter lymphoid tissues and others circulate in the bloodstream tlymphocyte production although most prolific in youth continues probably throughout life from a resident population of thymic stem cells the maturation of the thymus and other lymphoid tissue is stimulated by thymosin a hormone secreted by the epithelial cells that form the framework of the thymus gland involution of the gland begins in adolescence and with increasing age the effectiveness of the tlymphocyte response to antigens declines mucosaassociated lymphoid tissue malt throughout the body at strategically placed locations are collections of lymphoid tissue which unlike the spleen and thymus are not enclosed in a capsule they contain b and tlymphocytes which have migrated from bone marrow and the thymus and are important in the early detection of invaders however as they have no afferent lymphatic vessels they do not filter lymph and are therefore not exposed to diseases spread by lymph malt is found throughout the gastrointestinal tract in the respiratory tract and in the genitourinary tract all systems of the body exposed to the external environment the main groups of malt are the tonsils and peyers patches tonsils these are located in the mouth and throat and will therefore destroy swallowed and inhaled antigens see also p 243 peyers patches these large collections of lymphoid tissue are found in the small intestine and intercept swallowed antigens,the lymphatic system is crucial for immune defense and fluid balance comprising lymph nodes the spleen the thymus gland and mucosaassociated lymphoid tissue malt lymph nodes small beanshaped organs located along lymphatic vessels lymph nodes filter lymph as it passes through removing pathogens dead cells and foreign materials they contain reticular and lymphatic tissue rich in lymphocytes that proliferate in response to infections enhancing the immune response spleen the largest lymphatic organ the spleen is located in the left hypochondriac region of the abdomen it filters blood removing old red blood cells and storing up to 350 ml of blood the spleen contains lymphocytes and is vital for immune function but lacks afferent lymphatics reducing its exposure to lymphborne diseases thymus gland situated in the upper mediastinum the thymus is essential for tlymphocyte maturation it produces thymosin a hormone that stimulates tlymphocyte development enabling them to distinguish between self and nonself tissues mucosaassociated lymphoid tissue malt found in mucosal areas throughout the body malt consists of nonencapsulated lymphoid tissue that detects antigens providing rapid immune responses these components work together to maintain immune surveillance and protect the body from infections
pathology associated with lymph vessels the main involvements of lymph vessels are in relation to the spread of disease in the body the effects of lymphatic obstruction spread of disease the materials most commonly spread via the lymph vessels from their original site to the circulating blood are fragments of tumours and infected material fragments of tumours tumour cells may enter a lymph capillary draining a tumour or a larger vessel when a tumour has eroded its wall cells from a malignant tumour if not phagocytosed settle and multiply in the first lymph node they encounter later there may be further spread to other lymph nodes to the blood and to other parts of the body via the blood in this sequence of events each new metastatic tumour becomes a source of malignant cells that may spread by the same routes infected material infected material may enter lymph vessels either at their origin in the interstitial spaces or through the walls of larger vessels invaded by microbes when infection spreads locally if phagocytosis is not effective the infection may spread from node to node and eventually reach the bloodstream lymphangitis infection of lymph vessel walls this occurs in some acute pyogenic infections in which the microbes in the lymph draining from the area infect and spread along the walls of lymph vessels eg in acute streptococcus pyogenes infection of the hand a red line may be seen extending from the hand to the axilla this is caused by an inflamed superficial lymph vessel and adjacent tissues the infection may be stopped at the first lymph node or spread through the lymph drainage network to the blood lymphatic obstruction when a lymph vessel is obstructed there is an accumulation of lymph distal to the obstruction called lymphoedema the amount of resultant swelling and the size of the area affected depend on the size of the vessel involved lymphoedema usually leads to lowgrade inflammation and fibrosis of the lymph vessel and further lymphoedema the most common causes are tumours and surgery tumours a tumour may grow into and block a lymph vessel or node obstructing the flow of lymph a large tumour outside the lymphatic system may cause sufficient pressure to stop the flow of lymph surgery in some surgical procedures lymph nodes are removed because cancer cells may have already spread to them this is done to prevent growth of secondary tumours in local lymph nodes and further spread of the disease via the lymphatic system eg axillary nodes may be removed during mastectomy diseases of lymph nodes acute lymphadenitis acute infection of lymph nodes is usually caused by microbes transported in lymph from other areas of infection the nodes become inflamed enlarged and congested with blood and chemotaxis attracts large numbers of phagocytes if lymph node defences phagocytes and antibody production are overwhelmed the infection may cause abscess formation within the node adjacent tissues may become involved and infected materials may be transported through other nodes and into the blood acute lymphadenitis is secondary to a number of conditions infectious mononucleosis glandular fever this is a highly contagious viral infection usually of young adults spread by direct contact during the incubation period of 7 to 10 days viruses multiply in the epithelial cells of the pharynx they subsequently spread to cervical nodes then to lymphoid tissue throughout the body clinical features include tonsillitis lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly a common complication is myalgic encephalitis chronic fatigue syndrome p 184 clinical or subclinical infection confers lifelong immunity other diseases minor lymphadenitis accompanies many infections and indicates the mobilisation of normal protective resources more serious infection occurs in measles anthrax typhoid fever wound and skin infections catscratch fever chronic lymphadenitis occurs following unresolved acute infections in tuberculosis syphilis and some lowgrade infections lymphomas these are malignant tumours of lymphoid tissue and are classified as either hodgkins or nonhodgkin lymphomas hodgkins disease in this disease there is progressive painless enlargement of lymph nodes throughout the body as lymphoid tissue within them proliferates the superficial lymph nodes in the neck are often the first to be noticed the disease is malignant and the cause is unknown the rate of progress varies considerably but the pattern of spread is predictable because the disease spreads to adjacent nodes and to other tissues in a consistent way the effectiveness of treatment depends largely on the stage of the disease at which it begins the disease leads to reduced immunity because lymphocyte function is depressed and recurrent infection is therefore common as lymph nodes enlarge they may compress adjacent tissues and organs anaemia and changes in leukocyte numbers occur if the bone marrow is involved nonhodgkin lymphomas these tumours eg multiple myeloma and burkitts lymphoma may occur in any lymphoid tissue and in bone marrow they are classified according to the type of cell involved and the degree of malignancy ie low intermediate or high grade lowgrade tumours consist of welldifferentiated cells and slow progress of the disease death occurring after a period of years highgrade lymphomas consist of poorly differentiated cells and rapid progress of the disease death occurring in weeks or months some low or intermediategrade tumours change their status to high grade with increased rate of progress the expanding lymph nodes may compress adjacent tissues and organs immunological deficiency leads to increased incidence of infections and if the bone marrow andor spleen is involved there may be varying degrees of anaemia and leukopenia malignant neoplastic metastases metastatic tumours develop in lymph nodes in any part of the body lymph from a tumour may contain cancer cells that are filtered off by the lymph nodes if not phagocytosed they multiply forming metastatic tumours nodes nearest the primary tumour are affected first but there may be further spread through the sequence of nodes eventually reaching the bloodstream,lymph vessels are crucial in the spread of diseases particularly through the dissemination of tumor fragments and infectious materials tumor cells can invade lymphatic capillaries where they may proliferate in lymph nodes leading to metastasis this process allows malignant cells to travel from the original tumor site to other parts of the body infectious agents can also enter lymph vessels if phagocytosis fails these pathogens may spread from node to node and eventually reach the bloodstream leading to conditions like lymphangitisan infection of the lymph vessel walls that manifests as red streaks along affected areas lymphatic obstruction results in the accumulation of lymph fluid causing lymphoedema this condition often leads to inflammation and fibrosis primarily due to external pressures from tumors or surgical removal of lymph nodes during cancer treatment diseases associated with lymph nodes include acute lymphadenitis characterized by inflammation and potential abscess formation due to infections lymphomas malignant tumors arising from lymphoid tissue include hodgkins diseasemarked by painless lymph node enlargementand nonhodgkin lymphomas which exhibit varying degrees of malignancy both conditions can compromise immune function increasing susceptibility to infections and other complications
disorders of the spleen splenomegaly enlargement of the spleen enlargement of the spleen is usually secondary to other conditions eg infections circulatory disorders blood diseases malignant neoplasms infections the spleen may be infected by bloodborne microbes or by local spread of infection the red pulp becomes congested with blood and there is an accumulation of phagocytes and plasma cells acute infections are rare chronic infections some chronic nonpyogenic infections cause splenomegaly but this is usually less severe than in the case of acute infections the most commonly occurring primary infections include tuberculosis typhoid fever malaria brucellosis undulant fever infectious mononucleosis circulatory disorders splenomegaly due to congestion of blood occurs when the flow of blood through the liver is impeded by eg fibrosis in cirrhosis of liver portal venous congestion in rightsided heart failure blood diseases splenomegaly may be caused by blood diseases the spleen enlarges to deal with the extra workload associated with removing damaged worn out and abnormal blood cells in eg haemolytic and macrocytic anaemia polycythaemia and chronic myeloid leukaemia splenomegaly may cause blood disease when the spleen is enlarged for any reason especially in portal hypertension excessive and premature haemolysis of red cells or phagocytosis of normal white cells and platelets leads to marked anaemia leukopenia and thrombocytopenia tumours benign and primary malignant tumours of the spleen are rare but bloodspread tumour fragments from elsewhere in the body may cause metastatic tumours splenomegaly caused by infiltration of malignant cells is characteristic of some conditions especially chronic leukaemia hodgkins disease and nonhodgkin lymphoma diseases of the thymus gland enlargement of the gland is associated with some autoimmune diseases such as thyrotoxicosis and addisons disease autoimmune conditions are those in which the immune system treats normal body cells or secretions as antigens and destroys them p 385 tumours are rare and seldom metastasise pressure caused by enlargement of the gland may damage or interfere with the functions of adjacent structures eg the trachea oesophagus or veins in the neck in myasthenia gravis an autoimmune disease in which there is skeletal muscle weakness p 385 most patients have either thymic hyperplasia majority or thymoma minority,disorders of the spleen splenomegaly or enlargement of the spleen typically arises secondary to various conditions infections the spleen can become congested with blood phagocytes and plasma cells due to bloodborne infections or local spread common infections leading to splenomegaly include tuberculosis typhoid fever malaria brucellosis and infectious mononucleosis chronic infections generally cause less severe enlargement than acute ones circulatory disorders conditions that impede blood flow through the liver such as cirrhosis or rightsided heart failure can lead to blood congestion and subsequent spleen enlargement blood diseases in disorders like hemolytic anemia and chronic myeloid leukemia the spleen works overtime to remove damaged and abnormal blood cells resulting in splenomegaly this may cause anemia leukopenia and thrombocytopenia due to excessive cell destruction tumors while primary tumors of the spleen are uncommon metastatic tumors can occur from other cancers particularly in cases of hodgkins disease and nonhodgkin lymphoma diseases of the thymus gland the thymus may enlarge in autoimmune diseases like thyrotoxicosis and addisons disease potentially affecting nearby structures such as the trachea and esophagus in myasthenia gravis patients often exhibit thymic hyperplasia or thymoma
the nervous system the nervous system detects and responds to changes inside and outside the body together with the endocrine system it controls important aspects of body function and maintains homeostasis nervous system stimulation provides an immediate response while endocrine activity is in the main slower and more prolonged ch 8 the nervous system consists of the brain the spinal cord and peripheral nerves organisation of nervous tissue within the body enables rapid communication between different parts of the body response to changes in the internal environment maintains homeostasis and regulates involuntary functions eg blood pressure and digestive activity response to changes in the external environment maintains posture and other voluntary activities for descriptive purposes the parts of the nervous system are grouped as follows the central nervous system cns consisting of the brain and the spinal cord the peripheral nervous system pns consisting of all the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord the pns comprises paired cranial and sacral nerves some of these are sensory afferent some are motor efferent and some mixed it is useful to consider two functional parts within the pns the sensory division the motor division fig 71 in turn the motor division is involved in activities that are voluntary the somatic nervous system movement of voluntary muscles involuntary the autonomic nervous system functioning of smooth and cardiac muscle and glands the autonomic nervous system has two parts sympathetic and parasympathetic neurones the nervous system consists of a vast number of cells called neurones fig 72 supported by a special type of connective tissue neuroglia each neurone consists of a cell body and its processes one axon and many dendrites neurones are commonly referred to simply as nerve cells bundles of axons bound together are called nerves neurones cannot divide and for survival they need a continuous supply of oxygen and glucose unlike many other cells neurones can synthesise chemical energy atp only from glucose the effects of damage to neurones are described on page 175 the physiological units of the nervous system are nerve impulses or action potentials which are akin to tiny electrical charges however unlike ordinary electrical wires the neurones are actively involved in conducting nerve impulses in effect the strength of the impulse is maintained throughout the length of the neurone some neurones initiate nerve impulses while others act as relay stations where impulses are passed on and sometimes redirected properties of neurones neurones have the characteristics of irritability and conductivity irritability is the ability to initiate nerve impulses in response to stimuli from outside the body eg touch light waves inside the body eg a change in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood alters respiration a thought may result in voluntary movement in the body this stimulation may be described as partly electrical and partly chemical electrical in that motor neurones and sensory nerve endings initiate nerve impulses and chemical in the transmission of impulses between one neurone and the next or between a neurone and an effector organ conductivity means the ability to transmit an impulse cell bodies nerve cells vary considerably in size and shape but they are all too small to be seen by the naked eye cell bodies form the grey matter of the nervous system and are found at the periphery of the brain and in the centre of the spinal cord groups of cell bodies are called nuclei in the central nervous system and ganglia in the peripheral nervous system axons and dendrites axons and dendrites are extensions of cell bodies and form the white matter of the nervous system axons are found deep in the brain and in groups called tracts at the periphery of the spinal cord they are referred to as nerves or nerve fibres outside the brain and spinal cord axons each nerve cell has only one axon carrying nerve impulses away from the cell body they are usually longer than the dendrites sometimes as long as 100 cm structure of an axon the membrane of the axon is called axolemma and it encloses the cytoplasmic extension of the cell body large axons and those of peripheral nerves are surrounded by a myelin sheath fig 73a this consists of a series of schwann cells arranged along the length of the axon each one is wrapped around the axon so that it is covered by a number of concentric layers of schwann cell plasma membrane between the layers of plasma membrane there is a small amount of fatty substance called myelin the outermost layer of schwann cell plasma membrane is sometimes called neurilemma there are tiny areas of exposed axolemma between adjacent schwann cells called nodes of ranvier which assist the rapid transmission of nerve impulses postganglionic fibres and some small fibres in the central nervous system are nonmyelinated in this type a number of axons are embedded in schwann cell plasma membranes fig 73b the adjacent schwann cells are in close association and there is no exposed axolemma the speed of transmission of nerve imp ulses is significantly slower in nonmyelinated fibres dendrites the dendrites are the many short processes that receive and carry incoming impulses towards cell bodies they have the same structure as axons but they are usually shorter and branching in motor neurones they form part of synapses fig 78a and in sensory neurones they form the sensory receptors that respond to stimuli the nerve impulse action potential an impulse is initiated by stimulation of sensory nerve endings or by the passage of an impulse from another nerve transmission of the impulse or action potential is due to movement of ions across the nerve cell membrane in the resting state the nerve cell membrane is polarised due to differences in the concentrations of ions across the plasma membrane this means that there is a different electrical charge on each side of the membrane that is called the resting membrane potential at rest the charge on the outside is positive and inside it is negative the principal ions involved are sodium na the main extracellular cation potassium k the main intracellular cation in the resting state there is a continual tendency for these ions to diffuse along their concentration gradients ie k outwards and na into cells when stimulated the permeability of the nerve cell membrane to these ions changes initially na floods into the neurone from the ecf causing depolarisation creating a nerve impulse or action potential depolarisation is very rapid enabling the conduction of a nerve impulse along the entire length of a neurone in a few milliseconds ms it passes from the point of stimulation in one direction only ie away from the point of stimulation towards the area of resting potential the oneway direction of transmission is ensured because following depolarisation it takes time for repolarisation to occur during this process k floods out of the neurone and the movement of these ions returns the membrane potential to its resting state this is called the refractory period during which restimulation is not possible as the neurone returns to its original resting state the action of the sodium pump expels na from the cell in exchange for k p 34 in myelinated neurones the insulating properties of the myelin sheath prevent the movement of ions therefore electrical changes across the membrane can only occur at the gaps in the myelin sheath ie at the nodes of ranvier when an impulse occurs at one node depolarisation passes along the myelin sheath to the next node so that the flow of current appears to leap from one node to the next this is called saltatory conduction fig 74 the speed of conduction depends on the diameter of the neurone the larger the diameter the faster the conduction myelinated fibres conduct impulses faster than unmyelinated fibres because saltatory conduction is faster than the complete conduction or simple propagation fig 75 the fastest fibres can conduct impulses to eg skeletal muscles at a rate of 130 metres per second while the slowest impulses travel at 05 metres per second types of nerves fig 76 sensory or afferent nerves when action potentials are generated by sensory receptors on the dendrites of these neurones they are transmitted to the spinal cord by the sensory nerve fibres the impulses may then pass to the brain or to connector neurones of reflex arcs in the spinal cord p 159 sensory receptors specialised endings of sensory neurones respond to different stimuli changes inside and outside the body somatic cutaneous or common senses these originate in the skin they are pain touch heat and cold sensory nerve endings in the skin are fine branching filaments without myelin sheaths fig 77 when stimulated an impulse is generated and transmitted by the sensory nerves to the brain where the sensation is perceived proprioceptor senses these originate in muscles and joints and contribute to the maintenance of balance and posture special senses these are sight hearing smell touch and taste ch 8 autonomic afferent nerves these originate in internal organs glands and tissues eg baroreceptors chemoreceptors and are associated with reflex regulation of involuntary activity and visceral pain motor or efferent nerves motor nerves originate in the brain spinal cord and autonomic ganglia they transmit impulses to the effector organs muscles and glands there are two types somatic nerves involved in voluntary and reflex skeletal muscle contraction autonomic nerves sympathetic and parasympathetic involved in cardiac and smooth muscle contraction and glandular secretion mixed nerves in the spinal cord sensory and motor nerves are arranged in separate groups or tracts outside the spinal cord when sensory and motor nerves are enclosed within the same sheath of connective tissue they are called mixed nerves the synapse and neurotransmitters there is always more than one neurone involved in the transmission of a nerve impulse from its origin to its destination whether it is sensory or motor there is no physical contact between these neurones the point at which the nerve impulse passes from one to another is the synapse fig 78 at its free end the axon of the presynoptic neurone breaks up into minute branches which terminate in small swellings called synaptic knobs or terminal boutons these are in close proximity to the dendrites and the cell body of the postsynaptic neurone the space between them is the synaptic cleft in the ends of synaptic knobs there are spherical synaptic vesicles containing a chemical the neurotransmitter which is released into synaptic clefts neurotransmitters are synthesised by nerve cells actively transported along the axons and stored in the synaptic vesicles they are released by exocytosis in response to the action potential and diffuse across the synaptic cleft they act on specific receptor sites on the postsynaptic membranes their action is short lived as immediately they have stimulated the postsynaptic neurone or effector organ such as a muscle fibre they are either inactivated by enzymes or taken back into the synaptic knob a knowledge of the action of different neurotransmitters is important because some drugs neutralise or prolong their effect usually neurotransmitters have an excitatory effect at the synapse but they are sometimes inhibitory the neurotransmitters in the brain and spinal cord and their modes of action are not yet fully understood it is believed however that nor adrenaline gamma ammo butyric acid gaba and acetylcholine act as neurotransmitters other substances such as dopamine serotonin 5hydroxytryptamine enkephalins endorphins and substance p have similar functions figure 79 summarises the neurotransmitters known to function in the peripheral nervous system somatic nerves carry impulses directly to the synapses at skeletal muscles the neuromuscular junctions in autonomic nerves impulses travel along two nerves preganglionic and postganglionic and across two synapses to the effector organs in both the sympathetic and the parasympathetic divisions the neuromuscular junction the axons of motor neurones conveying impulses to skeletal muscle to produce contraction divide into fine filaments terminating in minute pads called motor endplates fig 710 at the point where the nerve reaches the muscle the myelin sheath is absent and the fine filament passes to a sensitive area on the surface of the muscle fibre each muscle fibre is stimulated through a single motor endplate and one motor nerve has many motor endplates the motor endplate and the sensitive area of muscle fibre through which it is stimulated is analogous to the synapse between neurones and is known as the neuromuscular junction the nerve impulse is passed across the gap between the motor endplate and the muscle fibre by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine the group of muscle fibres and the motor endplates of the nerve fibre that supplies them constitute a motor unit nerve impulses cause serial contraction of motor units in a muscle and each unit contracts to its full capacity the strength of the contraction depends on the number of motor units in action at a particular time the endings of autonomic nerves supplying smooth muscle and glands branch near their effector structure and release a neurotransmitter which stimulates or depresses the activity of the structure figs 79 743 and 744,the human circulatory system is essential for transporting oxygen nutrients hormones and waste products throughout the body it consists of the heart blood vessels arteries veins and capillaries and blood the heart is divided into four chambers two atria and two ventricles blood circulates in two main pathwaysthe pulmonary and systemic circuits in the pulmonary circuit deoxygenated blood is pumped from the right ventricle to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries in the lungs carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen and oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium the systemic circuit starts when oxygenrich blood is pumped from the left ventricle through the aorta delivering oxygen and nutrients to the bodys tissues via arteries once the blood has exchanged oxygen for waste products it returns to the heart through veins entering the right atrium and completing the cycle capillaries the smallest blood vessels are crucial for gas and nutrient exchange between blood and tissues the circulatory system helps regulate body temperature ph levels and immune responses proper functioning of the heart and vessels is vital for maintaining homeostasis and ensuring that cells receive what they need to survive
central nervous system the central nervous system consists of the brain and the spinal cord neuroglia the neurones of the central nervous system are supported by four types of nonexcitable glial cells that make up a quarter to a half of the volume of brain tissue unlike nerve cells these continue to replicate throughout life they are astrocytes oligodendrocytes microglia and ependymal cells astrocytes these cells form the main supporting tissue of the central nervous system they are starshaped with fine branching processes and they lie in a mucopolysaccharide ground substance at the free ends of some of the processes there are small swellings called foot processes astrocytes are found in large numbers adjacent to blood vessels with their foot processes forming a sleeve round them this means that the blood is separated from the neurones by the capillary wall and a layer of astrocyte foot processes which together constitute the bloodbrain barrier fig 711 their functions are analogous to those of fibroblasts elsewhere in the body the bloodbrain barrier is a selective barrier that protects the brain from potentially toxic substances and chemical variations in the blood eg after a meal oxygen carbon dioxide alcohol barbiturates glucose and lipophilic substances quickly cross the barrier into the brain some large molecules drugs inorganic ions and amino acids pass slowly from the blood to the brain oligodendrocytes these cells are smaller than astrocytes and are found in clusters round nerve cell bodies the grey matter where they are thought to have a supportive function adjacent to and along the length of myelinated nerve fibres the oligodendrocytes form and maintain myelin having the same functions as schwann cells in peripheral nerves microglia these cells are derived from monocytes that migrate from the blood into the nervous system before birth they are found mainly in the area of blood vessels they enlarge and become phagocytic in areas of inflammation and cell destruction ependymal cells these cells form the epithelial lining of the ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord membranes covering the brain and spinal cord the meninges the brain and spinal cord are completely surrounded by three membranes the meninges lying between the skull and the brain and between the vertebrae and the spinal cord fig 712 named from outside inwards they are dura mater arachnoid mater pia mater the dura and arachnoid maters are separated by a potential space the subdural space the arachnoid and pia maters are separated by the subarachnoid space containing cerebrospinal fluid dura mater the cerebral dura mater consists of two layers of dense fibrous tissue the outer layer takes the place of the periosteum on the inner surface of the skull bones and the inner layer provides a protective covering for the brain there is only a potential space between the two layers except where the inner layer sweeps inwards between the cerebral hemispheres to form the falx cerebri between the cerebellar hemispheres to form the falx cerebelli and between the cerebrum and cerebellum to form the tentorium cerebelli fig 712 venous blood from the brain drains into venous sinuses between the layers of dura mater the superior sagittal sinus is formed by the falx cerebri and the tentorium cerebelli forms the straight and transverse sinuses spinal dura mater forms a loose sheath round the spinal cord extending from the foramen magnum to the second sacral vertebra thereafter it encloses the filum terminole and fuses with the periosteum of the coccyx it is an extension of the inner layer of cerebral dura mater and is separated from the periosteum of the vertebrae and ligaments within the neural canal by the epiduml or extradural space containing blood vessels and areolar tissue it is attached to the foramen magnum and by a number of fibrous slips to the posterior longitudinal ligament at intervals along its length nerves entering and leaving the spinal cord pass through the epidural space these attachments stabilise the spinal cord in the neural canal dyes used for diagnostic purposes and local anaesthetics or analgesics to relieve pain may be injected into the epidural space arachnoid mater this delicate serous membrane lies between the dura and pia maters it is separated from the dura mater by the subdural space and from the pia mater by the subarachnoid space containing cerebrospinal fluid the arachnoid mater passes over the convolutions of the brain and accompanies the inner layer of dura mater in the formation of the falx cerebri tentorium cerebelli and falx cerebelli it continues downwards to envelop the spinal cord and ends by merging with the dura mater at the level of the 2nd sacral vertebra pia mater this is a fine connective tissue containing many minute blood vessels it adheres to the brain completely covering the convolutions and dipping into each fissure it continues downwards surrounding the spinal cord beyond the end of the cord it continues as the filum terminale pierces the arachnoid tube and goes on with the dura mater to fuse with the periosteum of the coccyx,the central nervous system cns consists of the brain and spinal cord both protected by specialized structures and supported by neuroglia neuroglia are nonexcitable cells that make up a large portion of brain tissue and include four types astrocytes oligodendrocytes microglia and ependymal cells astrocytes are starshaped cells that form the bloodbrain barrier by surrounding blood vessels helping protect the brain from harmful substances and chemical fluctuations in the blood oligodendrocytes smaller than astrocytes produce and maintain myelin which insulates nerve fibers and aids in rapid nerve transmission microglia act as the brains immune cells becoming phagocytic during inflammation and cell damage ependymal cells line the brains ventricles and the spinal cords central canal surrounding the cns are three protective membranes known as meninges dura mater arachnoid mater and pia mater the dura mater is a tough fibrous layer that provides a protective covering for the brain and spinal cord the arachnoid mater a delicate membrane lies between the dura and pia maters with the subarachnoid space containing cerebrospinal fluid for cushioning the pia mater is a thin vascular membrane that adheres closely to the brain and spinal cord providing support and nourishment
brain the brain constitutes about onefiftieth of the body weight and lies within the cranial cavity the parts are fig 715 149 cerebrum midbrain pons medulla oblongata cerebellum blood supply to the brain the circulus arteriosus and its contributing arteries see fig 534 p 100 play a vital role in maintaining a constant supply of oxygen and glucose to the brain even when a contributing artery is narrowed or the head is moved the brain receives about 15 of the cardiac output approximately 750 ml of blood per minute autoregulation keeps blood flow to the brain constant by adjusting the diameter of the arterioles across a wide range of arterial blood pressure about 65140 mmhg with changes occurring only outside these limits cerebrum this is the largest part of the brain and it occupies the anterior and middle cranial fossae see fig 168 p 393 it is divided by a deep cleft the longitudinal cerebral fissure into right and left cerebral hemispheres each containing one of the lateral ventricles deep within the brain the hemispheres are connected by a mass of white matter nerve fibres called the corpus callosum the falx cerebri is formed by the dura mater fig 712 it separates the two hemispheres and penetrates to the depth of the corpus callosum the superficial peripheral part of the cerebrum is composed of nerve cell bodies or grey matter forming the cerebral cortex and the deeper layers consist of nerve fibres or white matter the cerebral cortex shows many infoldings or furrows of varying depth the exposed areas of the folds are the gyri or convolutions and these are separated by sulci or fissures these convolutions greatly increase the surface area of the cerebrum for descriptive purposes each hemisphere of the cerebrum is divided into lobes which take the names of the bones of the cranium under which they lie frontal parietal temporal occipital the boundaries of the lobes are marked by deep sulci fissures these are the central lateral and parietooccipital sulci fig 716 interior of the cerebrum fig 717 the surface of the cerebral cortex is composed of grey matter nerve cell bodies within the cerebrum the lobes are connected by masses of nerve fibres or tracts which make up the white matter of the brain the afferent and efferent fibres linking the different parts of the brain and spinal cord are as follows association arcuate fibres connect different parts of a cerebral hemisphere by extending from one gyrus to another some of which are adjacent and some distant commissural fibres connect corresponding areas of the two cerebral hemispheres the largest and most important commissure is the corpus callosum projection fibres connect the cerebral cortex with grey matter of lower parts of the brain and with the spinal cord eg the internal capsule the internal capsule is an important area consisting of projection fibres it lies deep within the brain between the basal nuclei ganglia and the thalamus many nerve impulses passing to and from the cerebral cortex are carried by fibres that form the internal capsule motor fibres within the internal capsule form the pyramidal tracts corticospinal tracts that cross over decussate at the medulla oblongata functions of the cerebrum there are three main varieties of activity associated with the cerebral cortex mental activities involved in memory intelligence sense of responsibility thinking reasoning moral sense and learning are attributed to the higher centres sensory perception including the perception of pain temperature touch sight hearing taste and smell initiation and control of skeletal voluntary muscle contraction functional areas of the cerebrum fig 718 the main areas of the cerebrum associated with sensory perception and voluntary motor activity are known but it is unlikely that any area is associated exclusively with only one function except where specially mentioned the different areas are active in both hemispheres motor areas of the cerebrum the precentral motor area this lies in the frontal lobe immediately anterior to the central sulcus the cell bodies are pyramid shaped betzs cells and they initiate the contraction of skeletal muscles a nerve fibre from a betzs cell passes downwards through the internal capsule to the medulla oblongata where it crosses to the opposite side then descends in the spinal cord at the appropriate level in the spinal cord the nerve impulse crosses a synapse to stimulate a second neurone which terminates at the motor endplate of a muscle fibre this means that the motor area of the right hemisphere of the cerebrum controls voluntary muscle movement on the left side of the body and vice versa the neurone with its cell body in the cerebrum is the upper motor neurone and the other with its cell body in the spinal cord is the lower motor neurone fig 719 damage to either of these neurones may result in paralysis in the motor area of the cerebrum the body is represented upside down ie the cells nearest the vertex control the feet and those in the lowest part control the head neck face and fingers fig 720a the sizes of the areas of cortex representing different parts of the body are proportional to the complexity of movement of the body part not to its size figure 720a shows that in comparison with the trunk the hand foot tongue and lips are represented by large cortical areas the premotor area this lies in the frontal lobe immediately anterior to the motor area the cells are thought to exert a controlling influence over the motor area ensuring an orderly series of movements for example in tying a shoe lace or writing many muscles contract but the movements must be coordinated and carried out in a particular sequence such a pattern of movement when established is described as manual dexterity in the lower part of this area just above the lateral sulcus there is a group of nerve cells known as the motor speech brocas area which controls the movements necessary for speech it is dominant in the left hemisphere in righthanded people and vice versa the frontal area this extends anteriorly from the premotor area to include the remainder of the frontal lobe it is a large area and is more highly developed in humans than in other animals it is thought that communications between this and the other regions in the cerebrum are responsible for the behaviour character and emotional state of the individual no particular behaviour character or intellectual trait has so far been attributed to the activity of any one group of cells sensory areas of the cerebrum the postcentral sensory area this is the area behind the central sulcus here sensations of pain temperature pressure and touch knowledge of muscular movement and the position of joints are perceived the sensory area of the right hemisphere receives impulses from the left side of the body and vice versa the size of the areas representing different parts of the body fig 720b is proportional to the extent of sensory innervation eg the large area for the face is consistent with the extensive sensory nerve supply by the three branches of the trigeminal nerves 5th cranial nerves the parietal area this lies behind the postcentral area and includes the greater part of the parietal lobe of the cerebrum its functions are believed to be associated with obtaining and retaining accurate knowledge of objects it has been suggested that objects can be recognised by touch alone because of the knowledge from past experience memory retained in this area the sensory speech area this is situated in the lower part of the parietal lobe and extends into the temporal lobe it is here that the spoken word is perceived there is a dominant area in the left hemisphere in righthanded people and vice versa the auditory hearing area this lies immediately below the lateral sulcus within the temporal lobe the cells receive and interpret impulses transmitted from the inner ear by the cochlear auditory part of the vestibulocochlear nerves 8th cranial nerves the olfactory smell area this lies deep within the temporal lobe where impulses from the nose via the olfactory nerves 1st cranial nerves are received and interpreted the taste area this is thought to lie just above the lateral sulcus in the deep layers of the sensory area this is the area where impulses from special nerve endings in taste buds in the tongue and in the lining of the cheeks palate and pharynx are perceived as taste the visual area this lies behind the parietooccipital sulcus and includes the greater part of the occipital lobe the optic nerves 2nd cranial nerves pass from the eye to this area which receives and interprets the impulses as visual impressions other areas of the cerebrum deep within the cerebral hemispheres there are groups of cell bodies called nuclei previously called ganglia which act as relay stations where impulses are passed from one neurone to the next in a chain fig 717 important masses of grey matter include basal nuclei thalamus hypothalamus basal nuclei these are areas of grey matter lying deep within the cerebral hemispheres with connections to the cerebral cortex and thalamus the basal nuclei form part of the extrapyramidal tracts and are thought to be involved in initiating muscle tone in slow and coordinated activities if control is inadequate or absent movements are jerky clumsy and uncoordinated thalamus the thalamus consists of two masses of nerve cells and fibres situated within the cerebral hemispheres just below the corpus callosum one on each side of the third ventricle sensory input from the skin viscera and special sense organs is transmitted to the thalamus before redistribution to the cerebrum hypothalamus the hypothalamus is composed of a number of groups of nerve cells it is situated below and in front of the thalamus immediately above the pituitary gland the hypothalamus is linked to the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland by nerve fibres and to the anterior lobe by a complex system of blood vessels through these connections the hypothalamus controls the output of hormones from both lobes of the gland see p 215 other functions with which the hypothalamus is concerned include control of the autonomic nervous system p 170 appetite and satiety thirst and water balance body temperature p 365 emotional reactions eg pleasure fear rage sexual behaviour including mating and child rearing biological clocks or circadian rhythms eg sleeping and waking cycles body temperature and secretion of some hormones,the brain accounting for about onefiftieth of body weight is located within the cranial cavity and consists of key parts the cerebrum midbrain pons medulla oblongata and cerebellum it receives 15 of the cardiac output about 750 ml of blood per minute with autoregulation ensuring stable blood flow the cerebrum the largest region is divided into right and left hemispheres by the longitudinal fissure and is connected by the corpus callosum the grey matter forms the outer layer cortex while white matter lies deeper facilitating communication between brain regions through association commissural and projection fibres key motor areas control voluntary muscle movements while sensory areas process stimuli such as touch temperature and pain specific lobes including the frontal parietal temporal and occipital lobes handle different functions like motor control sensory input and higher mental activities like reasoning and memory deep within the brain the basal nuclei help regulate coordinated movement while the thalamus acts as a relay for sensory signals the hypothalamus governs critical bodily functions like hunger thirst temperature regulation and emotions and controls hormone release via the pituitary gland
brain stem midbrain the midbrain is the area of the brain situated around the cerebral aqueduct between the cerebrum above and the pons below it consists of groups of cell bodies and nerve fibres tracts which connect the cerebrum with lower parts of the brain and with the spinal cord the cell bodies act as relay stations for the ascending and descending nerve fibres pons the pons is situated in front of the cerebellum below the midbrain and above the medulla oblongata it consists mainly of nerve fibres which form a bridge between the two hemispheres of the cerebellum and of fibres passing between the higher levels of the brain and the spinal cord there are groups of cells within the pons which act as relay stations and some of these are associated with the cranial nerves the anatomical structure of the pons differs from that of the cerebrum in that the cell bodies grey matter lie deeply and the nerve fibres are on the surface medulla oblongata the medulla oblongata extends from the pons above and is continuous with the spinal cord below it is about 25 cm long and it lies just within the cranium above the foramen magnum its anterior and posterior surfaces are marked by central fissures the outer aspect is composed of white matter which passes between the brain and the spinal cord and grey matter lies centrally some cells constitute relay stations for sensory nerves passing from the spinal cord to the cerebrum the vital centres consisting of groups of cells associated with autonomic reflex activity lie in its deeper structure these are the cardiac centre respiratory centre vasomotor centre reflex centres of vomiting coughing sneezing and swallowing the medulla oblongata has several special features decussation crossing of the pyramids in the medulla motor nerves descending from the motor area in the cerebrum to the spinal cord in the pyramidal corticospinal tracts cross from one side to the other this means that the left hemisphere of the cerebrum controls the right half of the body and vice versa these tracts are the main pathway for impulses to skeletal voluntary muscles sensory decussation some of the sensory nerves ascending to the cerebrum from the spinal cord cross from one side to the other in the medulla others decussate at lower levels ie in the spinal cord the cardiovascular centre controls the rate and force of cardiac contraction p 87 sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve fibres originating in the medulla pass to the heart sympathetic stimulation increases the rate and force of the heartbeat and parasympathetic stimulation has the opposite effect the respiratory centre controls the rate and depth of respiration from this centre nerve impulses pass to the phrenic and intercostal nerves which stimulate contraction of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles thus initiating inspiration the respiratory centre is stimulated by excess carbon dioxide and to a lesser extent by deficiency of oxygen in its blood supply and by nerve impulses from the chemoreceptors in the carotid bodies p 256 the vasomotor centre p 80 controls the diameter of the blood vessels especially the small arteries and arterioles which have a large proportion of smooth muscle fibres in their walls vasomotor impulses reach the blood vessels through the autonomic nervous system stimulation may cause either constriction or dilatation of blood vessels depending on the site see figs 743 and 744 pp 171 and 172 the sources of stimulation of the vasomotor centre are the arterial baroreceptors body temperature and emotions such as sexual excitement and anger pain usually causes vasoconstriction although severe pain may cause vasodilatation a fall in blood pressure and fainting reflex centres when irritating substances are present in the stomach or respiratory tract nerve impulses pass to the medulla oblongata stimulating the reflex centres which initiate the reflex actions of vomiting coughing and sneezing to expel the irritant reticular formation the reticular formation is a collection of neurones in the core of the brain stem surrounded by neural pathways which conduct ascending and descending nerve impulses between the brain and the spinal cord it has a vast number of synaptic links with other parts of the brain and is therefore constantly receiving information being transmitted in ascending and descending tracts functions the reticular formation is involved in coordination of skeletal muscle activity associated with voluntary motor movement and the maintenance of balance coordination of activity controlled by the autonomic nervous system eg cardiovascular respiratory and gastrointestinal activity selective awareness that functions through the reticular activating system ras which selectively blocks or passes sensory information to the cerebral cortex eg the slight sound made by a sick child moving in bed may arouse his mother but the noise of regularly passing trains may be suppressed cerebellum the cerebellum fig 721 is situated behind the pons and immediately below the posterior portion of the cerebrum occupying the posterior cranial fossa it is ovoid in shape and has two hemispheres separated by a narrow median strip called the vermis grey matter forms the surface of the cerebellum and the white matter lies deeply functions the cerebellum is concerned with the coordination of voluntary muscular movement posture and balance cerebellar activities are not under voluntary control the cerebellum controls and coordinates the movements of various groups of muscles ensuring smooth even precise actions it coordinates activities associated with the maintenance of the balance and equilibrium of the body the sensory input for these functions is derived from the muscles and joints the eyes and the ears proprioceptor impulses from the muscles and joints indicate their position in relation to the body as a whole and those impulses from the eyes and the semicircular canals in the ears provide information about the position of the head in space impulses from the cerebellum influence the contraction of skeletal muscle so that balance and posture are maintained damage to the cerebellum results in clumsy uncoordinated muscular movement staggering gait and inability to carry out smooth steady precise movements,the brain stem comprising the midbrain pons and medulla oblongata serves as a crucial link between the cerebrum and the spinal cord midbrain located between the cerebrum and pons the midbrain contains nerve fibres that relay signals to and from the brain and spinal cord playing a vital role in sensory and motor pathways pons situated above the medulla and below the midbrain the pons connects the two cerebellar hemispheres and facilitates communication between higher brain regions and the spinal cord it contains relay stations for cranial nerves medulla oblongata extending from the pons to the spinal cord the medulla regulates vital autonomic functions such as heart rate breathing and blood pressure it features decussation where nerve tracts cross over allowing the left hemisphere to control the right side of the body reticular formation this network of neurons within the brain stem modulates muscle coordination autonomic functions and sensory awareness filtering information that reaches the cerebral cortex cerebellum positioned behind the pons the cerebellum coordinates voluntary movements posture and balance utilizing sensory feedback from muscles joints eyes and ears to ensure smooth motor control
spinal cord the spinal cord is the elongated almost cylindrical part of the central nervous system which is suspended in the vertebral canal surrounded by the meninges and cerebrospinal fluid fig 722 it is continuous above with the medulla oblongata and extends from the upper border of the atlas to the lower border of the 1st lumbar vertebra fig 723 it is approximately 45 cm long in an adult caucasian male and is about the thickness of the little finger when a specimen of cerebrospinal fluid is required it is taken from a point below the end of the cord ie below the level of the 2nd lumbar vertebra this procedure is called lumbar puncture except for the cranial nerves the spinal cord is the nervous tissue link between the brain and the rest of the body fig 724 nerves conveying impulses from the brain to the various organs and tissues descend through the spinal cord at the appropriate level they leave the cord and pass to the structure they supply similarly sensory nerves from organs and tissues enter and pass upwards in the spinal cord to the brain some activities of the spinal cord are independent of the brain ie spinal reflexes to facilitate these there are extensive neurone connections between sensory and motor neurones at the same or different levels in the cord the spinal cord is incompletely divided into two equal parts anteriorly by a short shallow median fissure and posteriorly by a deep narrow septum the posterior median septum a crosssection of the spinal cord shows that it is composed of grey matter in the centre surrounded by white matter supported by neuroglia figure 725 shows the parts of the spinal cord and the nerve roots on one side the other side is the same grey matter the arrangement of grey matter in the spinal cord resembles the shape of the letter h having two posterior two anterior and two lateral columns the area of grey matter lying transversely is the transverse commissure and it is pierced by the central canal an extension from the fourth ventricle containing cerebrospinal fluid fig 725 the cell bodies may be sensory cells which receive impulses from the periphery of the body lower motor neurones which transmit impulses to the skeletal muscles connector neurones linking sensory and motor neurones at the same or different levels which form spinal reflex arcs at each point where nerve impulses are passed from one neurone to another there is a synaptic cleft and a neurotransmitter fig 78 posterior columns of grey matter these are composed of cell bodies which are stimulated by sensory impulses from the periphery of the body the nerve fibres of these cells contribute to the formation of the white matter of the cord and transmit the sensory impulses upwards to the brain anterior columns of grey matter these are composed of the cell bodies of the lower motor neurones which are stimulated by the axons of the upper motor neurones or by the cell bodies of connector neurones linking the anterior and posterior columns to form reflex arcs the posterior root spinal ganglia are composed of cell bodies which lie just outside the spinal cord on the pathway of the sensory nerves all sensory nerve fibres pass through these ganglia the only function of the cells is to promote the onward movement of nerve impulses white matter the white matter of the spinal cord is arranged in three columns or tracts anterior posterior and lateral these tracts are formed by sensory nerve fibres ascending to the brain motor nerve fibres descending from the brain and fibres of connector neurones tracts are often named according to their points of origin and destination eg spinothalamic corticospinal sensory nerve tracts afferent or ascending in the spinal cord there are two main sources of sensation transmitted to the brain via the spinal cord 1 the skin sensory receptors nerve endings in the skin called cutaneous receptors are stimulated by pain heat cold and touch including pressure nerve impulses generated are conducted by three neurones to the sensory area in the opposite hemisphere of the cerebrum where the sensation and its location are perceived fig 726 crossing to the other side or decussation occurs either at the level of entry into the cord or in the medulla 2 the tendons muscles and joints sensory receptors are nerve endings in these structures called proprioceptors and they are stimulated by stretch together with impulses from the eyes and the ears they are associated with the maintenance of balance and posture and with perception of the position of the body in space these nerve impulses have two destinations by a threeneurone system the impulses reach the sensory area of the opposite hemisphere of the cerebrum by a twoneurone system the nerve impulses reach the cerebellar hemisphere on the same side table 71 provides further information about the origins routes of transmission and the destinations of sensory nerve impulses motor nerve tracts efferent or descending in the spinal cord neurones which transmit nerve impulses away from the brain are motor efferent or descending neurones motor neurone stimulation results in contraction of skeletal striated voluntary muscle contraction of smooth involuntary muscle cardiac muscle and the secretion by glands controlled by nerves of the autonomic nervous system p 170 voluntary muscle movement the contraction of the muscles which move the joints is in the main under conscious voluntary control which means that the stimulus to contract originates at the level of consciousness in the cerebrum however some nerve impulses which affect skeletal muscle contraction are initiated in the midbrain brain stem and cerebellum this involuntary activity is associated with coordination of muscle activity eg when very fine movement is required and in the maintenance of posture and balance efferent nerve impulses are transmitted from the brain to the body via bundles of nerve fibres or tracts in the spinal cord the motor pathways from the brain to the muscles are made up of two neurones fig 719 these tracts are either pyramidal corticospinal extrapyramidal the motor fibres that form the pyramidal tracts travel through the internal capsule and are the main pathway for impulses to voluntary skeletal muscles those motor fibres that do not pass through the internal capsule form the extrapyramidal tracts and have connections with many parts of the brain including the basal nuclei and the thalamus the upper motor neurone this has its cell body betzs cell in the precentral sulcus area of the cerebrum the axons pass through the internal capsule pons and medulla in the spinal cord they form the lateral corticospinal tracts of white matter and the fibres terminate in close association with the cell bodies of the lower motor neurones in the anterior columns of grey matter the axons of these upper motor neurones make up the pyramidal tracts and decussate in the medulla oblongata forming the pyramids the lower motor neurone this has its cell body in the anterior horn of grey matter in the spinal cord its axon emerges from the spinal cord by the anterior root joins with the incoming sensory fibres and forms the mixed spinal nerve which passes through the intervertebral foramen near its termination in muscle the axon branches into a variable number of tiny fibres which form motor endplates each of which is in close association with a sensitive area on the wall of a muscle fibre the motor endplates of each nerve and the muscle fibres they supply form a motor unit fig 710 the neurotransmitter that conveys the nerve impulse across the synapse to stimulate the muscle fibre is acetylcholine motor units contract as a whole and the strength of contraction of a muscle depends on the number of motor units in action at a time the lower motor neurone has been described as the final common pathway for the transmission of nerve impulses to skeletal muscles the cell body of this neurone is influenced by a number of upper motor neurones originating from various sites in the brain and by some neurones which begin and end in the spinal cord some of these neurones stimulate the cell bodies of the lower motor neurone while others have an inhibiting effect the outcome of these influences is smooth coordinated muscle movement some of which is voluntary and some involuntary involuntary muscle movement upper motor neurones these have their cell bodies in the brain at a level below the cerebrum ie in the midbrain brain stem cerebellum or spinal cord they influence muscle activity in relation to the maintenance of posture and balance the coordination of muscle movement and the control of muscle tone table 72 shows details of the area of origin of these neurones and the tracts which their axons form before reaching the cell of the lower motor neurone in the spinal cord spinal reflexes these consist of three elements sensory neurones connector neurones in the spinal cord lower motor neurones in the simplest reflex arc there is only one of each fig 727 a reflex action is an immediate motor response to a sensory stimulus many connector and motor neurones may be stimulated by afferent impulses from a small area of skin eg the pain impulses initiated by touching a very hot surface with the finger are transmitted to the spinal cord by sensory nerves these stimulate many connector and lower motor neurones in the cord which results in the contraction of many skeletal muscles of the hand arm and shoulder and the removal of the finger reflex action takes place very quickly in fact the motor response may have occurred simultaneously with the perception of the pain in the cerebrum reflexes of this type are invariably protective but they can on occasion be inhibited for example if it is a precious plate that is very hot when lifted every effort will be made to overcome the pain to prevent dropping it stretch reflexes only two neurones are involved the cell body of the lower motor neurone is stimulated by the sensory neurone there is no connector neurone involved the knee jerk is one example but this type of reflex can be demonstrated at any point where a stretched tendon crosses a joint by tapping the tendon just below the knee when it is bent the sensory nerve endings in the tendon and in the thigh muscles are stretched this initiates a nerve impulse which passes into the spinal cord to the cell body of the lower motor neurone in the anterior column of grey matter on the same side as a result the thigh muscles suddenly contract and the foot kicks forward this is used as a test of the integrity of the reflex arc this type of reflex has a protective function it prevents excessive joint movement that may damage tendons ligaments and muscles,the spinal cord is an essential component of the central nervous system extending from the medulla oblongata to the first lumbar vertebra encased in the vertebral canal and surrounded by meninges and cerebrospinal fluid it measures about 45 cm in length in adult males the spinal cord serves as the main pathway for transmitting impulses between the brain and the body enabling both motor and sensory functions grey matter arranged in an h shape the grey matter contains sensory cells lower motor neurons and connector neurons that form spinal reflex arcs the posterior columns house sensory cell bodies that relay information to the brain while the anterior columns contain lower motor neuron cell bodies responsible for muscle contraction white matter organized into three columnsanterior posterior and lateralwhite matter consists of ascending sensory nerve tracts and descending motor nerve tracts sensory nerve impulses originate from skin receptors and proprioceptors in muscles and joints while motor impulses control voluntary and involuntary muscle movements reflexes spinal reflexes enable immediate responses to stimuli through a simple pathway of sensory connector and lower motor neurons demonstrating protective functions in response to harmful stimuli such as the withdrawal reflex from pain
peripheral nervous system this part of the nervous system consists of 31 pairs of spinal nerves 12 pairs of cranial nerves the autonomic part of the nervous system most of the nerves of the peripheral nervous system are composed of sensory nerve fibres conveying afferent impulses from sensory end organs to the brain and motor nerve fibres conveying efferent impulses from the brain through the spinal cord to the effector organs eg skeletal muscles smooth muscle and glands each nerve consists of numerous nerve fibres collected into bundles each bundle has several coverings of protective connective tissue fig 728 endoneurium is a delicate tissue surrounding each individual fibre which is continuous with the septa that pass inwards from the perineurium perineurium is a smooth connective tissue surrounding each bundle of fibres epineurium is the fibrous tissue which surrounds and encloses a number of bundles of nerve fibres most large nerves are covered by epineurium spinal nerves there are 31 pairs of spinal nerves that leave the vertebral canal by passing through the intervertebral foramina formed by adjacent vertebrae they are named and grouped according to the vertebrae with which they are associated fig 724 8 cervical 12 thoracic 5 lumbar 5 sacral 1 coccygeal although there are only seven cervical vertebrae there are eight nerves because the first pair leave the vertebral canal between the occipital bone and the atlas and the eighth pair leave below the last cervical vertebra thereafter the nerves are given the name and number of the vertebra immediately above the lumbar sacral and coccygeal nerves leave the spinal cord near its termination at the level of the first lumbar vertebra and extend downwards inside the vertebral canal in the subarachnoid space forming a sheaf of nerves which resembles a horses tail the cauda equina these nerves leave the vertebral canal at the appropriate lumbar sacral or coccygeal level depending on their destination the spinal nerves arise from both sides of the spinal cord and emerge through the intervertebral foramina each nerve is formed by the union of a motor and a sensory nerve root and is therefore a mixed nerve each spinal nerve has a contribution from the sympathetic part of the autonomic nervous system in the form of a preganglionic fibre see fig 743 p 171 for details of the bones and muscles mentioned in the following section see chapters 16 to 18 bones and joints are supplied by adjacent nerves nerve roots fig 729 the anterior nerve root consists of motor nerve fibres which are the axons of the nerve cells in the anterior column of grey matter in the spinal cord and in the thoracic and lumbar regions sympathetic nerve fibres which are the axons of cells in the lateral columns of grey matter the posterior nerve root consists of sensory nerve fibres just outside the spinal cord there is a spinal ganglion posterior root ganglion consisting of a little cluster of cell bodies sensory nerve fibres pass through these ganglia before entering the spinal cord the area of skin supplied by each nerve is called a dermatome figs 734 and 738 for a very short distance after leaving the spinal cord the nerve roots have a covering of dura and arachnoid maters these terminate before the two roots join to form the mixed spinal nerve the nerve roots have no covering of pia mater immediately after emerging from the intervertebral foramen each spinal nerve divides into a ramus communicans a posterior ramus and an anterior ramus the rami communicans are part of preganglionic sympathetic neurones of the autonomic nervous system p 170 the posterior rami pass backwards and divide into medial and lateral branches to supply skin and muscles of relatively small areas of the posterior aspect of the head neck and trunk the anterior rami supply the anterior and lateral aspects of the neck trunk and the upper and lower limbs in the cervical lumbar and sacral regions the anterior rami unite near their origins to form large masses of nerves or plexuses where nerve fibres are regrouped and rearranged before proceeding to supply skin bones muscles and joints of a particular area fig 730 this means that these structures have a nerve supply from more than one spinal nerve and therefore damage to one spinal nerve does not cause loss of function of a region in the thoracic region the anterior rami do not form plexuses there are five large plexuses of mixed nerves formed on each side of the vertebral column they are the cervical plexuses brachial plexuses lumbar plexuses sacral plexuses coccygeal plexuses cervical plexus fig 731 this is formed by the anterior rami of the first four cervical nerves it lies opposite the 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th cervical

the sternum the deep branches supply muscles of the neck eg the sternocleidomastoid and the trapezius the phrenic nerve originates from cervical roots 34 and 5 and passes downwards through the thoracic cavity in front of the root of the lung to supply the muscle of the diaphragm with impulses which stimulate contraction brachial plexus the anterior rami of the lower four cervical nerves and a large part of the first thoracic nerve form the brachial plexus figure 732 shows its formation and the nerves which emerge from it the plexus is situated in the neck and shoulder above and behind

from this plexus supply the skin in the area of the coccyx and the levators ani and coccygeus muscles of the pelvic floor and the external anal sphincter,the peripheral nervous system pns is composed of 31 pairs of spinal nerves 12 pairs of cranial nerves and the autonomic nervous system it serves as a communication network between the brain and the rest of the body sensory afferent nerve fibers carry signals from sensory organs to the brain while motor efferent fibers transmit commands from the brain to muscles and glands each nerve consists of bundles of fibers protected by connective tissue layers endoneurium perineurium and epineurium the 31 spinal nerves are named based on the vertebrae they emerge from and are divided into cervical thoracic lumbar sacral and coccygeal groups spinal nerves contain both sensory and motor fibers and are connected to the sympathetic part of the autonomic nervous system after leaving the spinal cord these nerves form plexusescervical brachial

include the phrenic nerve which controls the diaphragm the sciatic nerve the largest in the body which supplies the lower limbs and the radial and ulnar nerves which supply muscles and skin of the

and overlying skin the 12th pair are the subcostal nerves the 7th to the 12th thoracic nerves also supply the muscles and the skin of the posterior and anterior abdominal walls fig 739 cranial nerves fig 740 there are 12 pairs of cranial nerves originating from nuclei in the inferior surface of the brain some sensory some motor and some mixed their names and numbers are i olfactory sensory ii optic sensory iii oculomotor motor iv trochlear motor v trigeminal mixed vi abducent motor vii facial mixed viii vestibulocochlear auditory sensory ix glossopharyngeal mixed x vagus mixed xi accessory motor xii hypoglossal motor i olfactory nerves sensory these are the nerves of the sense of smell their nerve endings and fibres originate in the upper part of the mucous membrane of the nasal cavity pass upwards through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone and then go to the olfactory bulb see fig 823 p 206 the nerves then proceed backwards as the olfactory tract to the area for the perception of smell in the temporal lobe of the cerebrum ii optic nerves sensory these are the nerves of the sense of sight the fibres originate in the retinae of the eyes and they combine to form the optic nerves see fig 813 p 200 they are directed backwards and medially through the posterior part of the orbital cavity they then pass through the optic foramina of the sphenoid bone into the cranial cavity and join at the optic chiasma the nerves proceed backwards as the optic tracts to the lateral geniculate bodies of the thalamus impulses pass from these to the centre for sight in the occipital lobes of the cerebrum and to the cerebellum in the occipital lobe sight is perceived and in the cerebellum the impulses from the eyes contribute to the maintenance of balance posture and orientation of the head in space the central retinal artery and vein enter the eye enveloped by the fibres of the optic nerve iii oculomotor nerves motor these nerves arise from nerve cells near the cerebral aqueduct they supply four extraocular muscles which move the eyeball ie the superior medial and inferior recti and the inferior oblique muscle intraocular muscles ciliary muscles which alter the shape of the lens changing its refractive power circular muscles of the iris which constrict the pupil the levator palpebrae muscle which raises the upper eyelid iv trochlear nerves motor these nerves arise from nerve cells near the cerebral aqueduct they supply the superior oblique muscles of the eyes v trigeminal nerves mixed these nerves contain motor and sensory fibres and are among the largest of the cranial nerves they are the chief sensory nerves for the face and head including the oral and nasal cavities and teeth receiving impulses of pain temperature and touch the motor fibres stimulate the muscles of mastication there are three main branches of the trigeminal nerves the dermatomes supplied by the sensory fibres on the right side are shown in figure 741 the ophthalmic nerves are sensory only and supply the lacrimal glands conjunctiva of the eyes forehead eyelids anterior aspect of the scalp and mucous membrane of the nose the maxillary nerves are sensory only and supply the cheeks upper gums upper teeth and lower eyelids the mandibular nerves contain both sensory and motor fibres these are the largest of the three divisions and they supply the teeth and gums of the lower jaw pinnae of the ears lower lip and tongue the motor fibres supply the muscles of mastication vi abducent nerves motor these nerves arise from a group of nerve cells lying under the floor of the fourth ventricle they supply the lateral rectus muscles of the eyeballs vii facial nerves mixed these nerves are composed of both motor and sensory nerve fibres arising from nerve cells in the lower part of the pons the motor fibres supply the muscles of facial expression the sensory fibres convey impulses from the taste buds in the anterior twothirds of the tongue to the taste perception area in the cerebral cortex viii vestibulocochlear auditory nerves sensory these nerves are composed of two distinct sets of fibres vestibular nerves and cochlear nerves the vestibular nerves arise from the semicircular canals of the inner ear and convey impulses to the cerebellum they are associated with the maintenance of posture and balance the cochlear nerves originate in the organ of corti in the inner ear and convey impulses to the hearing areas in the cerebral cortex where sound is perceived ix glossopharyngeal nerves mixed these nerves arise from nuclei in the medulla oblongata the motor fibres stimulate the muscles of the tongue and pharynx and the secretory cells of the parotid salivary glands the sensory fibres convey impulses to the cerebral cortex from the posterior third of the tongue the tonsils and pharynx and from taste buds in the tongue and pharynx these nerves are essential for the swallowing and gag reflexes x vagus nerves mixed fig 742 these nerves have a more extensive distribution than any other cranial nerves they arise from nerve cells in the medulla oblongata and other nuclei and pass down through the neck into the thorax and the abdomen these nerves form an important part of the parasympathetic nervous system fig 744 the motor fibres supply the smooth muscles and secretory glands of the pharynx larynx trachea heart oesophagus stomach intestines pancreas gall bladder bile ducts spleen kidneys ureter and blood vessels in the thoracic and abdominal cavities the sensory fibres convey impulses from the lining membranes of the same structures to the brain xi accessory nerves motor these nerves arise from cell bodies in the medulla oblongata and in the spinal cord the fibres supply the sternodeidomastoid and trapezius muscles branches join the vagus nerves and supply the phanyngeal and laryngeal muscles xii hypoglossal nerves motor these nerves arise from cells in the medulla oblongata they supply the muscles of the tongue and muscles

nerves these nerves pass between the ribs and supply the ribs intercostal muscles and the overlying skin the 12th pair are known as subcostal nerves thoracic nerves 7 through 12 also innervate the muscles and skin of the posterior and anterior abdominal walls cranial nerves there are 12 pairs of cranial nerves which originate from the brains inferior surface these nerves can be sensory motor or

sensory nerve for balance and hearing glossopharyngeal ix mixed nerve for taste and throat functions vagus x mixed nerve for parasympathetic control of organs accessory xi motor nerve for neck and shoulder muscles hypoglossal xii motor nerve for tongue movement
autonomic nervous system the autonomic or involuntary part of the nervous system fig 76 controls the functions of the body carried out automatically ie initiated in the brain below the level of the cerebrum although stimulation does not occur voluntarily the individual may be conscious of its effects eg an increase in the heart rate the effects of autonomic control are rapid and essential for homeostasis the effector organs are smooth muscle cardiac muscle glands fig 76 effects of autonomic stimulation include changes in rate and force of the heartbeat stimulation or depression of secretion of glands vasoconstriction or vasodilatation bronchoconstriction or bronchodilation changes in size of the pupils of the eyes the efferent motor nerves of the autonomic nervous system arise from nerve cells in the brain and emerge at various levels between the midbrain and the sacral region of the spinal cord many of them travel within the same nerve sheath as the peripheral nerves of the central nervous system to reach the organs which they innervate the autonomic nervous system is divided into two divisions sympathetic thoracolumbar outflow parasympathetic craniosacral outflow the two divisions have both structural and functional differences they normally work in an opposing manner enabling or restoring balance of involuntary functions maintaining homeostasis sympathetic activity tends to predominate in stressful situations and parasympathetic activity during rest each division has two efferent neurones in its peripheral pathways between the central nervous system and effector organs these are the preganglionic neurone the postganglionic neurone the cell body of the preganglionic neurone is in the brain or spinal cord its axon terminals synapse with the cell body of the postganglionic neurone in an autonomic ganglion outside the central nervous system the postganglionic neurone conducts impulses to the effector organ fig 79 sympathetic nervous system neurones convey impulses from their origin in the hypothalamus reticular formation and medulla oblongata to effector organs and tissues fig 743 the first neurone has its cell body in the brain and its fibre extends into the spinal cord the preganglionic neurone this has its cell body in the lateral column of grey matter in the spinal cord between the levels of the 1st thoracic and 2nd or 3rd lumbar vertebrae the nerve fibre of this cell leaves the cord by the anterior root and terminates in one of the ganglia either in the lateral chain of sympathetic ganglia or passes through it to one of the prevertebral ganglia acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter the postganglionic neurone this has its cell body in a ganglion and terminates in the organ or tissue supplied noradrenaline is usually the neurotransmitter sympathetic ganglia the lateral chains of sympathetic ganglia these are chains of ganglia which extend from the upper cervical level to the sacrum one chain lying on each side of the bodies of the vertebrae the ganglia are attached to each other by nerve fibres preganglionic neurones that emerge from the cord may synapse with the cell body of the postganglionic neurone at the same level or they may pass up or down the chain through one or more ganglia before synapsing for example the nerve which dilates the pupil of the eye leaves the cord at the level of the 1st thoracic vertebra and passes up the chain to the superior cervical ganglion before it synapses with the cell body of the postsynaptic neurone the postganglionic neurones then pass to the eyes the major exception is that there is no parasympathetic supply to the sweat glands the skin and blood vessels of skeletal muscles these structures are supplied by only sympathetic fibres some of which have acetylcholine and some adrenaline and noradrenaline as their neurotransmitter they have therefore the effects of both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve supply fig 743 prevertebral ganglia there are three prevertebral ganglia situated in the abdominal cavity close to the origins of arteries of the same names coeliac ganglion superior mesenteric ganglion inferior mesenteric ganglion the ganglia consist of nerve cell bodies rather diffusely distributed among a network of nerve fibres which form plexuses preganglionic sympathetic fibres pass through the lateral chain to reach these ganglia parasympathetic nervous system two neurones preganglionic and postganglionic are involved in the transmission of impulses from their source to the effector organ fig 744 the neurotransmitter at both synapses is acetylcholine the preganglionic neurone this has its cell body either in the brain or in the spinal cord those originating in the brain are the cranial nerves iii vii ix and x arising from nuclei in the midbrain and brain stem and their nerve fibres terminate outside the brain the cell bodies of the sacral outflow are in the lateral columns of grey matter at the distal end of the spinal cord their fibres leave the cord in sacral segments 2 3 and 4 and synapse with postganglionic neurones in the walls of pelvic organs the postganglionic neurone this has its cell body either in a ganglion or in the wall of the organ supplied functions of the autonomic nervous system the autonomic nervous system is involved in a complex of reflex activities which like the reflexes described previously depend on sensory input to the brain or spinal cord and on motor output in this case the reflex action is rapid contraction or inhibition of contraction of involuntary smooth and cardiac muscle or glandular secretion these reflexes are coordinated subconsciously in the brain ie below the level of the cerebrum some sensory input does reach consciousness and may result in temporary inhibition of the reflex action eg reflex micturition can be inhibited temporarily the majority of the organs of the body are supplied by both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves which have opposite effects that are finely balanced to ensure the optimum functioning of the organ sympathetic stimulation prepares the body to deal with exciting and stressful situations eg strengthening its defences in danger and in extremes of environmental temperature the adrenal glands are stimulated to secrete the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline into the bloodstream these hormones potentiate and sustain the effects of sympathetic stimulation it is sometimes said that sympathetic stimulation mobilises the body for fight or flight parasympathetic stimulation has a tendency to slow down body processes except digestion and absorption of food and the functions of the genitourinary systems its general effect is that of a peace maker allowing restoration processes to occur quietly and peacefully normally the two systems function together maintaining a regular heartbeat normal temperature and an internal environment compatible with the immediate external surroundings,the autonomic nervous system ans is the involuntary part of the nervous system regulating essential functions like heart rate digestion and respiration without conscious control it ensures rapid responses necessary for homeostasis the effector organs include smooth muscle cardiac muscle and glands the ans is divided into two main divisions sympathetic nervous system sns known for its fight or flight response the sns prepares the body to handle stress by increasing heart rate dilating pupils and redirecting blood flow to muscles it also stimulates the adrenal glands to release adrenaline and noradrenaline which enhance and prolong the sympathetic response parasympathetic nervous system pns opposing the sns the pns promotes a rest and digest state slowing the heart rate aiding in digestion and conserving energy it helps the body recover and maintain a state of calm both systems work in balance to maintain a stable internal environment each division has preganglionic and postganglionic neurons transmitting signals via neurotransmitters the sns primarily uses noradrenaline while the pns uses acetylcholine together these systems ensure that bodily functions adapt to both stressful and restful conditions
effects of autonomic stimulation cardiovascular system sympathetic stimulation exerts an accelerating effect upon the sinoatrial node in the heart increasing the rate and force of the heartbeat causes dilatation of the coronary arteries increasing the blood supply to cardiac muscle causes dilatation of the blood vessels supplying skeletal muscle increasing the supply of oxygen and nutritional materials and the removal of metabolic waste products thus increasing the capacity of the muscle to work raises peripheral resistance and blood pressure by constricting the small arteries and arterioles in the skin in this way an increased blood supply is available for highly active tissue such as skeletal muscle heart brain constricts the blood vessels in the secretory glands of the digestive system reducing the flow of digestive juices this raises the volume of blood available for circulation in dilated blood vessels blood coagulation occurs more quickly because of vasoconstriction parasympathetic stimulation decreases the rate and force of the heartbeat causes constriction of the coronary arteries reducing the blood supply to cardiac muscle the parasympathetic nervous system exerts little or no effect on blood vessels except the coronary arteries respiratory system sympathetic stimulation this causes dilatation of the airways especially the bronchioles allowing a greater amount of air to enter the lungs at each inspiration and increases the respiratory rate in conjunction with the increased heart rate the oxygen intake and carbon dioxide output of the body are increased parasympathetic stimulation produces constriction of the bronchi digestive and urinary systems sympathetic stimulation the liver converts an increased amount of glycogen to glucose making more carbohydrate immediately available to provide energy the adrenal suprarenal glands are stimulated to secrete adrenaline and noradrenaline which potentiate and sustain the effects of sympathetic stimulation the stomach and small intestine smooth muscle contraction and secretion of digestive juices are inhibited delaying digestion onward movement and absorption of food and the tone of sphincter muscles is increased urethral and anal sphincters the muscle tone of the sphincters is increased inhibiting micturition and defecation the bladder wall relaxes the metabolic rate is greatly increased parasympathetic stimulation the stomach and small intestine the rate of digestion and absorption of food is increased the pancreas there is an increase in the secretion of pancreatic juice and the hormone insulin urethral and anal sphincters relaxation of the internal urethral sphincter is accompanied by contraction of the muscle of the bladder wall and micturition occurs similar relaxation of the internal anal sphincter is accompanied by contraction of the muscle of the rectum and defecation occurs in both cases there is voluntary relaxation of the external sphincters eye sympathetic stimulation this causes contraction of the radiating muscle fibres of the iris dilating the pupil retraction of the levator palpebral muscles occurs opening the eyes wide and giving the appearance of alertness and excitement the ciliary muscle that adjusts the thickness of the lens is slightly relaxed parasympathetic stimulation this causes contraction of the circular muscle fibres of the iris constricting the pupil the eyelids tend to close giving the appearance of sleepiness skin sympathetic stimulation causes increased secretion of sweat leading to increased heat loss from the body produces contraction of the arrectores pilorum the muscles in the hair follicles of the skin giving the appearance of goose flesh causes constriction of the blood vessels preventing heat loss there is no parasympathetic nerve supply to the skin some sympathetic fibres are adrenergic causing vasoconstriction and some are cholinergic causing vasodilatation fig 79 afferent impulses from viscera sensory fibres from the viscera travel with autonomic fibres and are sometimes called autonomic afferents the impulses they transmit are associated with visceral reflexes usually at an unconscious level eg cough blood pressure sensation of eg hunger thirst nausea sexual sensation rectal and bladder distension visceral pain visceral pain normally the viscera are insensitive to cutting burning and crushing however a sensation of dull poorly located pain is experienced when visceral nerves are stretched a large number of fibres are stimulated there is ischaemia and local accumulation of metabolites the sensitivity of nerve endings to painful stimuli is increased eg during inflammation if the cause of the pain eg inflammation affects the parietal layer of a serous membrane pleura peritoneum the pain is acute and easily located over the site of inflammation this is because the peripheral spinal somatic nerves supplying the superficial tissues also supply the parietal layer of serous membrane they transmit the impulses to the cerebral cortex where somatic pain is perceived and accurately located appendicitis is an example of this type of pain initially it is dull and vaguely located around the midline of the abdomen as the condition progresses the parietal peritoneum becomes involved and acute pain is clearly located in the right iliac fossa ie over the appendix referred pain fig 745 in some cases of visceral disease pain may be perceived to occur in superficial tissues remote from the viscus ie referred pain this occurs when sensory fibres from the viscus enter the same segment of the spinal cord as somatic nerves ie those from the superficial tissues it is believed that the sensory nerve from the viscus stimulates the closely associated nerve in the spinal cord and it transmits the impulses to the sensory area in the cerebral cortex where the pain is perceived as originating in the area supplied by the somatic nerve examples of referred pain are given in table 74,the autonomic nervous system ans regulates involuntary functions such as heart rate digestion and respiratory activity it is divided into two branches the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems which work antagonistically to maintain homeostasis sympathetic stimulation triggers the fight or flight response it accelerates the heart rate by acting on the sinoatrial node dilates coronary and skeletal muscle blood vessels and raises blood pressure by constricting peripheral blood vessels it also dilates the bronchi allowing for increased airflow and converts glycogen to glucose in the liver for quick energy digestion slows as blood flow is redirected from the digestive organs to muscles and metabolic activity is increased in contrast parasympathetic stimulation promotes the rest and digest state it slows the heart rate constricts coronary arteries and promotes digestion by increasing smooth muscle contractions and secretion of digestive juices it also encourages urination and defecation through the relaxation of the urethral and anal sphincters visceral pain often dull and poorly localized occurs when visceral nerves are stimulated by factors such as stretching or ischemia if the parietal membrane is involved pain becomes sharp and more precisely localized referred pain is perceived in areas distant from the actual source of pain
response of nervous tissue to injury neurone damage damage to the nerve cells or their processes can lead to rapid necrosis with sudden acute functional failure or to slow atrophy with gradually increasing dysfunction these changes are associated with hypoxia and anoxia nutritional deficiencies poisons eg organic lead trauma infections ageing hypoglycaemia neurone regeneration fig746 neurones of the brain spinal cord and ganglia reach maturity a few weeks after birth and are not replaced when they are damaged or die the axons of peripheral nerves may regenerate if the cell body remains intact distal to the damage the axon and myelin sheath disintegrate and are removed by macrophages but the schwann cells survive and proliferate within the neurilemma the live proximal part of the axon grows along the original track about 3 mm per day provided the two parts of neurilemma are correctly positioned and in close apposition restoration of function depends on the reestablishment of satisfactory connections with the end organ when the neurilemma is out of position or destroyed the sprouting axons and schwann cells form a tumourlike cluster traumatic neuroma producing severe pain eg following some fractures and amputation of limbs neuroglia damage astrocytes when severely damaged astrocytes undergo necrosis and disintegrate in less severe and chronic conditions there is proliferation of astrocyte processes and later cell atrophy gliosis this process occurs in many diseases and is analogous to fibrosis in other tissues oligodendrocytes these cells form and maintain myelin having the same functions as schwann cells in peripheral nerves they increase in number around degenerating neurones and are destroyed in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis p 184 microglia microglia are derived from monocytes that migrate from the blood into the nervous system before birth and are found mainly around blood vessels where there is inflammation and cell destruction the microglia increase in size and become phagocytic effects of poisons on the central nervous system many chemical substances encountered either as drugs or in the environment may damage the nervous system neurone metabolism may be disturbed directly or result from damage to other organs eg liver kidneys the outcome depends on the toxicity of the substance the dose and the duration of exposure ranging from shortterm neurological disturbance to encephalopathy which may cause coma and death,response of nervous tissue to injury covers the effects of damage on neurons and neuroglia neuronal damage can result from trauma hypoxia toxins or infections this may lead to rapid necrosis where cells die suddenly or slow atrophy causing progressive dysfunction neurons in the brain and spinal cord cannot regenerate but peripheral nerve axons may recover if the cell body remains intact in this process the distal part of the axon degenerates but schwann cells survive and guide the regeneration of the axon if the neurilemma is misaligned a painful cluster called a traumatic neuroma may form often seen after amputations neuroglia damage involves astrocytes which can die or undergo gliosis a process similar to fibrosis in other tissues oligodendrocytes responsible for maintaining myelin are damaged in conditions like multiple sclerosis leading to demyelination microglia the brains immune cells become phagocytic in response to injury clearing cellular debris poisons and toxins can disrupt neuron function directly or indirectly by damaging other organs like the liver or kidneys exposure to toxins can cause temporary neurological disturbances or in severe cases encephalopathy leading to coma or death
disorders of the brain increased intracranial pressure this is a very serious complication of many conditions the cranium forms a rigid cavity enclosing the brain cerebral blood vessels and blood cerebrospinal fluid csf an increase in volume of any one of these will lead to raised intracranial pressure sometimes its effects are more serious than the condition causing it eg by disrupting the blood supply or distorting the shape of the brain especially if the intracranial pressure icp rises rapidly a slow rise in icp allows time for compensatory adjustment to be made ie a slight reduction in the volume of circulating blood and of csf the slower the rise in icp the more effective the compensation rising icp is accompanied by bradycardia and hypertension as it reaches its limit a further small increase in pressure is followed by a sudden and usually serious reduction in the cerebral blood flow the result is hypoxia and a rise in carbon dioxide levels causing arteriolar dilatation which further increases the icp this leads to progressive loss of functioning neurones which exacerbates bradycardia and hypertension further cerebral hypoxia causes vasomotor paralysis and death the causes of increased icp are described on the following pages and include cerebral oedema hydrocephalus the accumulation of excess csf expanding lesions inside the skull also known as spaceoccupying lesions haemorrhage haematoma traumatic or spontaneous tumours primary or secondary expanding lesions may occur in the brain or in the meninges and they may damage the brain in various ways fig 747 effects of increased icp displacement of the brain lesions causing displacement are usually onesided but may affect both sides such lesions may cause herniation displacement of part of the brain from its usual compartment of the cerebral hemisphere between the corpus callosum and the free border of the falx cerebri on the same side herniation of the midbrain between the pons and the free border of the tentorium cerebelli on the same side compression of the subarachnoid space and flattening of the cerebral convolutions distortion of the shape of the ventricles and their ducts herniation of the cerebellum through the foramen magnum protrusion of the medulla oblongata through the foramen magnum coning obstruction of the flow of cerebrospinal fluid the ventricles or their ducts may be pushed out of position or a duct obstructed the effects depend on the position of the lesion eg compression of the aqueduct of the midbrain causes dilatation of the lateral ventricles and the third ventricle further increasing the icp vascular damage there may be stretching or compression of blood vessels causing haemorrhage when stretched blood vessels rupture ischaemia and infarction due to compression of blood vessels papilloedema oedema round the optic disc due to compression of the retinal vein in the optic nerve sheath where it crosses the subarachnoid space neural damage the vital centres in the medulla oblongata may be damaged when the increased icp causes coning stretching may damage cranial nerves especially the oculomotor iii and the abducent vi causing disturbances of eye movement and accommodation bone changes prolonged increase of icp causes bony changes eg erosion especially of the sphenoid stretching and thinning before ossification is complete cerebral oedema there is movement of fluid from its normal compartment when oedema develops p 118 cerebral oedema occurs when there is excess fluid in brain cells andor in the interstitial spaces causing increased intracranial pressure it is associated with traumatic injury haemorrhage infections abscesses hypoxia local ischaemia infarcts tumours inflammation of the brain or meninges hypoglycaemia cytotoxic oedema the neurones and neuroglial cells contain excess water due to disturbances of their osmotic pressure caused by retention of excess electrolytes the permeability of the capillary walls is normal vaosgenic oedema excess fluid collects in the interstitial spaces especially round nerve fibres the permeability of the capillary walls is increased and plasma proteins pass out of the capillaries increasing the osmotic pressure in the interstitial spaces which causes oedema hydrocephalus in this condition the volume of csf is abnormally high and is usually accompanied by increased icp an obstruction to csf flow fig 714 is the most common cause it is described as communicating when there is free flow of csf from the ventricular system to the subarachnoid space and noncommunicating when there is not ie there is obstruction in the system of ventricles foramina or ducts enlargement of the head occurs in children when ossification of the cranial bones is incomplete but in spite of this the ventricles dilate and cause stretching and thinning of the brain after ossification is complete hydrocephalus leads to a marked increase in icp and destruction of neural tissue primary hydrocephalus this is usually caused by obstruction to the flow of csf and may be communicating or noncommunicating occasionally it is caused by malabsorption of csf by the arachnoid villi congenital primary hydrocephalus is due to malformation of the ventricles foramina or ducts usually at a narrow point acquired primary hydrocephalus is caused by lesions that obstruct the circulation of the csf usually expanding lesions eg tumours haematomas or adhesions between arachnoid and pia maters following meningitis secondary hydrocephalus compensatory increases in the amount of csf and ventricle capacity occur when there is atrophy of brain tissue eg in dementia and following cerebral infarcts there may not be a rise in icp,disorders of the brain focus primarily on increased intracranial pressure icp cerebral edema and hydrocephalus all of which can have severe consequences increased icp occurs when the brain cerebrospinal fluid csf or blood volume inside the cranium rises this can disrupt the brains blood supply causing hypoxia bradycardia and hypertension causes include cerebral edema hydrocephalus and spaceoccupying lesions such as tumors or hematomas effects include herniation of the brain displacement of brain structures and vascular damage which may lead to ischaemia or hemorrhage neural damage and bone changes may also occur cerebral edema results from excess fluid in brain cells or interstitial spaces which raises icp causes include trauma infection hemorrhage or hypoxia edema types include cytotoxic edema where cells retain water and vasogenic edema where fluid collects around nerve fibers hydrocephalus involves an abnormal accumulation of csf raising icp it can be communicating with free csf flow or noncommunicating where obstructions occur primary hydrocephalus is often due to malformations or obstructions while secondary hydrocephalus occurs as a compensatory mechanism in cases like dementia
head injuries the brain may be injured by a blow to the head or movement of the brain during sudden acceleration or deceleration of the head the damage to the brain may be serious even when there is no outward sign of injury blow to the head at the site of injury there may be a scalp wound with haemorrhage between scalp and skull bones damage to the underlying meninges andor brain with local haemorrhage inside the skull depressed fracture of the skull causing local damage to the underlying meninges and brain tissue temporal bone fracture making an opening between the middle ear and the meninges fracture involving the air sinuses of the sphenoid ethmoid or frontal bones making an opening between the nose and the meninges accelerationdeceleration injuries because the brain floats relatively freely in a cushion of csf sudden acceleration or deceleration has an inertia effect ie there is delay between the movement of the head and the corresponding movement of the brain during this period the brain may be compressed and damaged at the site of impact in centre coup injuries brain damage is more severe on the side opposite to the site of impact other injuries include nerve cell damage usually to the frontal and parietal lobes due to movement of the brain over the rough surface of bones of the base of the skull nerve fibre damage due to stretching especially following rotational movement haemorrhage due to rupture of blood vessels in the subarachnoid space on the side opposite the impact or more diffuse small haemorrhages following rotational movement complications of head injury if the individual survives the immediate effects complications may develop hours or days later sometimes they are the first indication of serious damage caused by a seemingly trivial injury their effects may be to increase icp damage brain tissue or provide a route of entry for microbes traumatic intracranial haemorrhage haemorrhage may occur causing secondary brain damage at the site of injury on the opposite side of the brain or diffusely throughout the brain if bleeding continues the expanding haematoma damages the brain and increases the icp extradural haemorrhage this may follow a direct blow that may or may not cause a fracture the individual may recover quickly and indications of increased icp only appear several hours later as the haematoma grows and the outer layer of dura mater periosteum is stripped off the bone the haematoma grows rapidly when arterial blood vessels are damaged in children there is rarely a fracture because the skull bones are still soft and the joints have not fused the haematoma usually remains localised acute subdural haemorrhage this is due to haemorrhage from small veins in the dura mater or from larger veins between the layers of dura mater before they enter the venous sinuses the blood may spread in the subdural space over one or both hemispheres fig 747b there may be concurrent subarachnoid haemorrhage especially when there are extensive brain contusions and lacerations chronic subdural haemorrhage this may occur weeks or months after minor injuries and sometimes there is no history of injury it occurs most commonly in people in whom there is some cerebral atrophy eg the elderly and alcoholics evidence of increased icp may be delayed when brain volume is reduced the haematoma formed gradually increases in size due to repeated small haemorrhages and causes mild chronic inflammation and accumulation of inflammatory exudate in time it is isolated by a wall of fibrous tissue intracerebral haemorrhage and cerebral oedema these occur following contusions lacerations and shearing injuries associated with acceleration and deceleration especially rotational movements cerebral oedema is a common complication of contusions of the brain leading to increased icp hypoxia and further brain damage meningitis inflammation of the meninges may occur following a compound fracture of the skull that is accompanied by leakage of csf and blood from the site providing a route of entry for microbes the escape of csf and blood may be through skin in compound fractures of the skull middle ear in fractures of the temporal bone csf otorrhoea nose in fractures of sphenoid ethmoid or frontal bones when the air sinuses are involved csf rhinorrhoea posttraumatic epilepsy this is usually characterised by seizures fits and may develop in the first week or several months after injury early development is most common after severe injuries although in children the injury itself may have appeared trivial after depressed fractures or large haematomas epilepsy tends to develop later persistent vegetative state in this condition there is severe brain damage that results in unconsciousness but the vital centres that control homeostasis remain intact eg breathing blood pressure,head injuries can result from a blow to the head or sudden accelerationdeceleration movements leading to brain damage even without visible external injury blow to the head injuries can involve scalp wounds with bleeding between the scalp and skull skull fractures potentially causing damage to the brain meninges or air sinuses creating routes for infections accelerationdeceleration injuries occur when the brain lags behind rapid head movements leading to nerve cell damage due to movement over the rough skull surface hemorrhage or nerve fiber damage from stretching especially during rotational movements complications of head injury include intracranial hemorrhage blood pooling inside the skull increases intracranial pressure icp potentially leading to brain damage types include extradural hemorrhage rapid bleeding between the skull and dura mater especially when arteries are damaged subdural hemorrhage bleeding in the dura mater layers which may spread over the brains hemispheres cerebral edema swelling of the brain due to injury leading to increased icp meningitis skull fractures can allow microbes into the meninges leading to infection posttraumatic epilepsy seizures may develop early after injury or months later particularly after severe trauma persistent vegetative state severe brain damage results in unconsciousness but with basic bodily functions intact
circulatory disturbances affecting the brain a number of abnormalities of the circulation not associated with head injuries commonly affect the brain cerebral hypoxia hypoxia may be due to disturbances in the autoregulation of blood supply to the brain conditions affecting cerebral blood vessels when the mean blood pressure falls below about 60 mmhg there is failure of the autoregulating mechanisms that control the blood flow to the brain by adjusting the diameter of the arterioles the consequent rapid decrease in the cerebral blood supply leads to hypoxia and lack of glucose if severe hypoxia is sustained for more than a few minutes there is irreversible brain damage the neurones are affected first then the neuroglial cells and later the meninges and blood vessels conditions in which autoregulation breaks down include cardiorespiratory arrest sudden severe hypotension carbon monoxide poisoning hypercapnia excess blood carbon dioxide drug overdosage with eg narcotics hypnotics analgesics conditions affecting cerebral blood vessels that may lead to hypoxia include occlusion of a cerebral artery by eg atheroma thrombosis rapidly expanding lesion embolism arterial stenosis that occurs in arteritis eg polyarteritis nodosa syphilis diabetes degenerative changes in the elderly if the individual survives the initial episode of ischaemia infarction necrosis and loss of function of the affected area of brain occurs stroke cerebrovascular disease this condition is a common cause of death and disability especially in the elderly predisposing factors include hypertension atheroma cigarette smoking diabetes mellitus it occurs when a vascular disease suddenly interrupts flow of blood to the brain causing hypoxia the effects include paralysis of a limb or one side of the body and disturbances of speech and vision the nature and extent of cerebral impairment depends on the size and location of the affected blood vessels the main causes are cerebral infarction approx 85 and spontaneous intracranial haemorrhage 15 cerebral infarction this is caused by atheroma complicated by thrombosis p 113 or blockage of an artery by an embolus from eg infective endocarditis when complete recovery occurs within 24 hours the event is called a transient ischaemic attack tia recurrence or completed stroke associated with permanent damage may follow spontaneous intracranial haemorrhage the haemorrhage may be into the subarachnoid space or intracerebral fig 748 it is commonly associated with an aneurysm or hypertension in each case the escaped blood may cause arterial spasm leading to ischaemia infarction fibrosis gliosis and hypoxic brain damage a severe haemorrhage may be instantly fatal while repeated small haemorrhages have a cumulative effect in extending brain damage multiinfarct dementia intracerebral haemorrhage prolonged hypertension leads to the formation of multiple microaneurysms in the walls of very small arteries in the brain rupture of one or more of these due to continuing rise in blood pressure is usually the cause of intracerebral haemorrhage the most common sites are branches of the middle cerebral artery in the region of the internal capsule and the basal nuclei ganglia severe haemorrhage this causes compression and destruction of tissue a sudden increase in icp and distortion and herniation of the brain death follows when the vital centres in the medulla oblongata are damaged by haemorrhage or if there is coning due to increased icp less severe haemorrhage this causes paralysis and loss of sensation of varying severity affecting the side of the body opposite the haemorrhage if the bleeding stops and does not recur an apoplectic cyst develops ie the haematoma is walled off by gliosis the blood clot is gradually absorbed and the cavity filled with tissue exudate when the icp returns to normal some functions may be restored eg speech and movement of limbs subarachnoid haemorrhage this is mostly due to rupture of a berry aneurysm on one of the major cerebral arteries or bleeding from a congenitally malformed blood vessel the blood may remain localised but usually spreads in the subarachnoid space round the brain and spinal cord causing a general increase in icp without distortion of the brain fig 747b the irritant effect of the blood may cause arterial spasm leading to ischaemia infarction gliosis and the effects of localised brain damage it occurs most commonly in middle life but occasionally in young people due to rapture of a malformed blood vessel this condition is often fatal or results in permanent disability dementia dementia is caused by progressive irreversible degeneration and atrophy of the cerebral cortex and results in mental deterioration usually over several years there is gradual impairment of memory especially short term intellect and reasoning emotional lability and personality change may also occur alzheimers disease this condition was previously called presenile dementia and is the commonest form of dementia it is of unknown aetiology although genetic factors may be involved females are affected twice as often as males and it usually affects those over 60 years the incidence increasing with age there is progressive atrophy of the cerebral cortex accompanied by deteriorating mental functioning death usually occurs between 2 and 8 years after onset huntingtons disease chorea this usually manifests itself between the ages of 30 and 50 years it is caused by a genetic abnormality associated with deficient production of the neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid gaba by the time of onset the individual may have passed the genetic abnormality on to the next generation extrapyramidal changes cause chorea rapid uncoordinated jerking movements of the limbs and involuntary twitching of the facial muscles as the disease progresses cortical atrophy causes personality changes and dementia secondary dementias dementia may occur in association with other diseases cerebrovascular disease multiinfarct dementia is the cumulative result of several small cerebral infarcts leading to the gradually increasing impairment of mental function infections eg encephalitis neurosyphilis human immunodeficiency virus hiv creutzfeldtjakob disease cerebral trauma chronic abuse of alcohol and some drugs vitamin b deficiency effects of metabolic disorders eg hypothyroidism uraemia liver failure parkinsons disease in this disease there is gradual degeneration of dopaminereleasing neurones in the extrapyramidal system this leads to lack of control and coordination of muscle movement resulting in fixed muscle tone causing expressionless facial features rigidity of voluntary muscles causing the slow and characteristic stiff shuffling gait and stooping posture muscle tremor of extremities eg pill rolling movement of the fingers the cause is usually unknown but some cases are associated with repeated trauma as in eg punch drunk boxers tumours causing midbrain compression drugs eg phenothiazines heavy metal poisoning there is progressive physical disability but the intellect is not impaired fig 749,circulatory disturbances in the brain such as cerebral hypoxia and stroke are common and can cause significant brain damage cerebral hypoxia occurs when blood flow is reduced leading to oxygen and glucose deprivation causes include failure in blood pressure regulation cardiorespiratory arrest severe hypotension or carbon monoxide poisoning prolonged hypoxia results in irreversible damage to neurons and brain tissues stroke is a leading cause of death and disability often triggered by either cerebral infarction blockage of a brain artery or intracranial hemorrhage rupture of a blood vessel stroke effects depend on the size and location of the damaged area and can lead to paralysis speech difficulties and vision problems intracerebral hemorrhage typically caused by prolonged hypertension can lead to sudden brain compression increased pressure and potential death subarachnoid hemorrhage often results from ruptured aneurysms leading to brain damage and increased intracranial pressure dementia is characterized by progressive brain degeneration leading to memory loss impaired reasoning and personality changes alzheimers disease and huntingtons disease are common types with alzheimers leading to severe cognitive decline and huntingtons causing uncoordinated movements parkinsons disease is marked by tremors muscle rigidity and movement difficulties due to loss of dopamineproducing neurons
infections of the central nervous system the brain and spinal cord are relatively well protected from microbial infection by the bloodbrain barrier when infection does occur microbes may be bloodborne from infection elsewhere in the body eg lung abscess introduced through a skull fracture p 179 spread through the skull bones from eg middle ear infection mastoiditis skull bone infection introduced during a surgical procedure eg lumbar puncture the microbes usually involved are bacteria and viruses occasionally protozoa and fungi the infection may originate in the meninges meningitis or in the brain encephalitis then spread from one site to the other pyogenic infection pyogenic meningitis meningitis is most commonly transmitted through contact with an infected individual pyogenic bacterial infection of the meninges is usually preceded by a mild respiratory tract infection during which a few bacteria enter the bloodstream they are carried to the meninges where they may remain localised in the extradural or subdural space if an abscess forms it may rupture into the subarachnoid space and spread to the brain causing encephalitis and further abscess formation infection of the arachnoid mater tends to spread diffusely in the subarachnoid space round the brain and spinal cord the onset is usually sudden with severe headache neck stiffness photophobia and fever this may be accompanied by a petechial rash in some cases mortality and morbidity rates are considerable pyogenic encephalitis this may involve single or multiple sites usually with abscess formation the microbes are either bloodborne or spread from adjacent meningeal infection the effects include the following inflammatory oedema and abscess formation lead to increased icp hypoxia and further brain damage when meningitis follows encephalitis healing takes place with the formation of fibrous adhesions which may interfere with csf circulation and cause hydrocephalus or compress blood vessels causing hypoxia following encephalitis and brain abscess healing is associated with gliosis and as destroyed nerve cells are not replaced loss of function depends on the site and extent of brain damage viral infections viral infections of the nervous system are relatively rare even when caused by neurotropic viruses ie those with an affinity for the nervous system viruses may cause meningitis encephalitis or lesions of the neurones of spinal cord and peripheral nerves most viruses are bloodborne although a few travel along peripheral nerves eg rabies virus and possibly polioviruses they enter the body via alimentary tract eg poliomyelitis respiratory tract eg shingles skin abrasions eg rabies the effects of viral infections vary according to the site and the amount of tissue destroyed viruses are believed to damage nerve cells by taking over their metabolism stimulating an immune reaction which may explain why signs of some infections do not appear until there is a high antibody titre 1 to 2 weeks after infection viral meningitis this is sometimes called aseptic meningitis because cultures for bacteria are sterile it is usually a relatively mild infection followed by complete recovery viral encephalitis viral encephalitis may affect a wide variety of sites and as nerve cells are not replaced loss of function reflects the extent of damage in severe infection neurones and neuroglia may be affected followed by necrosis and gliosis early senility may develop or if vital centres in the medulla oblongata are involved death may ensue in mild cases recovery is usually complete with little loss of function herpes simplex encephalitis this is an acute often fatal condition causing necrosis of areas of the cerebrum usually the temporal lobes if the patient survives the initial acute phase there may be residual dysfunction eg behavioural disturbance and loss of memory herpes zoster neuritis shingles herpes zoster viruses cause chickenpox varicella mainly in children and shingles zoster in adults susceptible children may contract chickenpox from a patient with shingles but not the reverse adults infected with the viruses may show no immediate signs of disease the viruses may remain dormant in posterior root ganglia of the spinal nerves then become active years later causing shingles reactivation may be either spontaneous or associated with the following factors local trauma involving the dermatome ie the area supplied by the affected peripheral nerve exposure of the dermatome to irradiation eg sun xrays depression of the immunological system eg by drugs old age aids the posterior root ganglion becomes acutely inflamed from there the viruses pass along the sensory nerve to the surface tissues supplied eg skin cornea the tissues become inflamed and vesicles containing serous fluid and viruses develop along the course of the nerve this is accompanied by persistent pain and hypersensitivity to touch hyperaesthesia recovery is usually slow and there may be some loss of sensation depending on the severity of the disease the infection is usually unilateral and the most common sites are nerves supplying the trunk sometimes two or three adjacent dermatomes fig 739 the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve fig 741 causing trigeminal neuralgia and if vesicles form on the cornea there may be ulceration scarring and residual interference with vision poliomyelitis this disease is usually caused by polioviruses and occasionally by other enteroviruses the infection is spread by food contaminated by infected faecal matter and the initial virus multiplication occurs in the alimentary tract the viruses are then bloodborne to the nervous system and invade anterior horn cells in the spinal cord usually there is a mild febrile illness with no indication of nerve damage in mild cases there is complete recovery but there is permanent disability in many others paralytic disease is believed to be precipitated by muscular exercise during the early febrile stage irreversible damage to lower motor neurones causes muscle paralysis which in the limbs may lead to deformity because of the unopposed tonal contraction of antagonistic muscles death may occur owing to respiratory paralysis vaccination programmes have now almost eradicated this disease in developed countries rabies all warmblooded animals are susceptible to the rabies virus which is endemic in many countries but not in britain the main reservoirs of virus are wild animals some of which may be carriers these may infect domestic pets which then become the main source of human infection the viruses multiply in the salivary glands and are present in large numbers in saliva they enter the body through skin abrasions and are believed to travel to the brain along the nerves the incubation period varies from about 2 weeks to several months possibly reflecting the distance viruses travel between the site of entry and the brain extensive damage to the basal nuclei midbrain medulla oblongata and the posterior root ganglia of the peripheral nerves causes meningeal irritation extreme hyperaesthesia muscle spasm and convulsions hydrophobia and overflow of saliva from the mouth are due to painful spasm of the throat muscles that inhibits swallowing in the advanced stages muscle spasm may alternate with flaccid paralysis and death is usually due to respiratory muscle spasm or paralysis not all people exposed to the virus contract rabies but in those who do the mortality rate is high human immunodeficiency virus hiv the brain is often affected in individuals with aids p 385 resulting in eg opportunistic infection dementia creutzfeldtjakob disease this infective condition may be caused by a slow virus the nature and transmission of which is poorly understood it is thought to be via a heatresistant transmissible particle known as a prion protein it is a rapidly progressive form of dementia for which there is no known treatment so the condition is always fatal myalgic encephalitis me this condition is also known as postviral syndrome or chronic fatigue syndrome it affects mostly teenagers and young adults and the aetiology is unknown sometimes the condition follows a viral illness the effects include malaise severe fatigue poor concentration and myalgia recovery is usually spontaneous but sometimes results in chronic disability,infections of the central nervous system cns including the brain and spinal cord occur when microbes breach the protective bloodbrain barrier these infections can arise from bloodborne pathogens trauma or spread from adjacent infections such as middle ear infections common causes are bacteria viruses fungi and protozoa pyogenic meningitis is a bacterial infection of the meninges often following respiratory infections it causes symptoms like severe headache neck stiffness fever and sometimes a rash if untreated it may lead to encephalitis causing brain inflammation abscesses and increased intracranial pressure which can result in permanent brain damage or death viral infections though rarer may lead to viral meningitis typically a mild infection with full recovery or viral encephalitis which can damage nerve cells leading to longterm loss of function or death other significant cns infections include herpes simplex encephalitis often fatal if untreated and shingles herpes zoster a reactivation of the chickenpox virus causing painful nerve inflammation poliomyelitis can cause paralysis by infecting spinal cord neurons and rabies is a deadly infection that causes severe neurological symptoms additionally hiv can lead to cns damage and creutzfeldtjakob disease is a fatal prion disease causing rapid dementia myalgic encephalitis chronic fatigue syndrome causes longterm fatigue and muscle pain
demyelinating diseases these diseases are caused either by injury to axons or by disorders of cells that secrete myelin ie oligodendrocytes and schwann cells multiple disseminated sclerosis ms in this disease there are areas of demyelinated white matter called plaques irregularly distributed throughout the brain and spinal cord grey matter in the brain and spinal cord may also be affected because of the arrangement of satellite oligodendrocytes round cell bodies in the early stages there may be little damage to axons it usually develops between the ages of 20 and 40 years and there is an increased incidence of ms among siblings especially twins and parents of patients it is not known whether this is due to genetic or environmental factors or a combination of both the actual causes of ms are not known but several factors have been suggested more than one of which may be involved environment before adolescence is suggested because the disease is most prevalent in people who spend their preadolescent years in temperate climates and people who move to other climates after that age retain their susceptibility to ms people moving into a temperate area during adolescence or later life appear not to be susceptible genetically abnormal myelin is present in many patients and may be antigenic causing the development of autoimmunity viral infection by slowgrowing viruses that attack myelin has been suggested but so far no virus has been identified effects of multiple sclerosis neuronal damage leads to a variety of dysfunctions depending on the sites and sizes of demyelinated plaques plaques damage white matter leading to upper motor neurone dysfunction causing weakness of skeletal muscles and sometimes paralysis lack of coordination and movement disturbed sensation eg burning or pins and needles incontinence of urine visual disturbances especially blurring and double vision the optic nerves are commonly affected early in the disease the disease pattern is usually one of relapses and remissions of widely varying duration each relapse causes further loss of nervous tissue and progressive dysfunction in some cases there may be chronic progression without remission or acute disease rapidly leading to death acute disseminating encephalomyelitis this is a rare but serious condition that may occur during or very soon after a virus infection eg measles chickenpox mumps respiratory infection following primary immunisation against viral diseases mainly in older children and adults the cause of the acute diffuse demyelination is not known it has been suggested that autoimmunity to myelin is triggered either by viruses during a viral infection such as measles or rubella or by viruses present in vaccines the effects vary considerably according to the distribution and degree of demyelination the early febrile state may progress to paralysis and coma most patients survive the initial phase and recover with no residual dysfunction but some have severe impairment of a wide variety of neurological functions phenylketonuria this is a genetic disorder in which the gene needed for synthesising the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase is absent this enzyme normally converts phenylalanine to tyrosine in the liver see figs 28 and 34 pp 24 and 32 phenylalanine is the intermediate metabolite that accumulates in the liver cells and overflows into the blood fig 750 in high quantities it is toxic to the nervous system and if untreated this condition results in brain damage and mental retardation within a few months tyrosine is a constituent of the skin pigment melanin and depigmentation occurs affected children are fair skinned and blonde the incidence of this disease is now low in developed countries because it is detected by screening all newborn infants and providing early treatment,demyelinating diseases are conditions where damage occurs to the myelin sheath which insulates nerve fibers these diseases result from injury to axons or disorders affecting myelinproducing cells oligodendrocytes and schwann cells multiple sclerosis ms is characterized by demyelinated plaques in the brain and spinal cord leading to symptoms such as muscle weakness visual disturbances and incontinence ms typically develops between the ages of 2040 and may involve genetic and environmental factors the disease follows a pattern of relapses and remissions progressively worsening over time acute disseminating encephalomyelitis occurs after viral infections or vaccinations causing widespread demyelination it can lead to paralysis or coma but many patients recover with little or no lasting effects phenylketonuria pku is a genetic disorder caused by the absence of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase leading to toxic accumulation of phenylalanine if untreated this results in brain damage mental retardation and depigmentation early detection through newborn screening prevents these outcomes
diseases of the spinal cord because space in the neural canal and intervertebral foramina is limited any condition which distorts their shape or reduces the space may damage the spinal cord or peripheral nerve roots or cause ischaemia by compressing blood vessels such conditions include fracture andor dislocation of vertebrae tumours of the meninges or vertebrae prolapsed intervertebral disc the effects of disease or injury depend on the severity of the damage the type and position of the neurones involved ie motor sensory proprioceptor autonomic connector neurones in reflex arcs in the spinal cord or in peripheral nerves motor neurones upper motor neurone umn lesions lesions of the umns above the level of the decussation of the pyramids affect the opposite side of the body eg haemorrhage or infarction in the internal capsule of one hemisphere causes paralysis of the opposite side of the body lesions below the decussation level affect the same side of the body the lower motor neurones are released from cortical control and muscle tone is increased lower motor neurone lmn lesions the cell bodies of lmns are in the spinal cord and the axons are part of peripheral nerves lesions of lmns lead to weakness or paralysis of the effector muscles they supply table 75 gives a summary of the effects of damage to the motor neurones the parts of the body affected depend on which neurones have been damaged and their site in the brain spinal cord or peripheral nerve motor neurone disease this is a chronic progressive degeneration of motor neurones occurring mainly in men between 60 and 70 years of age the cause is not known motor neurones in the cerebral cortex brain stem and anterior horns of the spinal cord are destroyed and replaced by gliosis early effects are usually weakness and twitching of the small muscles of the hand and muscles of the arm and shoulder girdle the legs are affected later death is usually due to the involvement of the respiratory centre in the medulla oblongata sensory neurones the sensory functions lost as a result of disease or injury depend on which neurones have been damaged and their position in the brain or spinal cord or the peripheral nerve involved in the brain neurones connecting the thalamus and the cerebrum pass through the internal capsule damage in this area by eg haemorrhage usually from a berry aneurysm may lead to loss of sensation but does not affect cerebellar function unless upper motor neurones have also been damaged spinal cord damage leads to loss of sensation and cerebellar function peripheral nerve damage leads to loss of reflex activity loss of sensation and of cerebellar function mixed motor and sensory conditions subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord this condition most commonly occurs as a complication of pernicious anaemia vitamin b12 is associated with the formation and maintenance of myelin by schwann cells and oligodendrocytes although degeneration of the spinal cord may be apparent before the anaemia it is arrested by treatment with vitamin b12 this type of degeneration may occasionally complicate chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus leukaemia and carcinoma the degeneration of nerve fibre myelin occurs in the posterior and lateral columns of white matter in the spinal cord especially in the upper thoracic and lower cervical regions less frequently the changes occur in the posterior root ganglia and peripheral nerves demyelination of proprioceptor fibres sensory leads to ataxia and involvement of upper motor neurones leads to increased muscle tone and spastic paralysis compression of the spinal cord and nerve roots the causes include prolapsed intervertebral disc syringomyelia tumours metastatic meningeal or nerve sheath fractures with displacement of bone fragments prolapsed intervertebral disc fig 751 this is the most common cause of compression of the spinal cord andor nerve roots the bodies of the vertebrae are separated by the intervertebral discs each consisting of an outer rim of cartilage the annulus fibrosus and a central core of soft gelatinous material the nucleus pulposus prolapse of a disc is herniation of the nucleus pulposus causing the annulus fibrosus and the posterior longitudinal ligament to protrude into the neural canal it is most common in the lumbar region usually below the level of the spinal cord ie below l2 so the injury is to nerve roots only if it occurs in the cervical region the cord may also be compressed herniation may occur suddenly typically in young adults during strenuous exercise or exertion or progressively in older people when bone disease or degeneration of the disc leads to rupture during minimal exercise the hernia may be onesided causing pressure damage to a nerve root midline compressing the spinal cord the anterior spinal artery and possibly bilateral nerve roots the outcome depends upon the size of the hernia and the length of time the pressure is applied small herniations cause local pain due to pressure on the nerve endings in the posterior longitudinal ligament large herniations may cause unilateral or bilateral paralysis acute or chronic pain perceived to originate from the area supplied by the compressed sensory nerve eg in the leg or foot compression of the anterior spinal artery causing ischaemia and possibly necrosis of the spinal cord local muscle spasm due to pressure on motor nerves syringomyelia this dilatation syrinx of the central canal of the spinal cord occurs most commonly in the cervical region and is associated with congenital abnormality of the distal end of the fourth ventricle as the central canal dilates pressure causes progressive damage to sensory and motor neurones early effects include dissociated anaesthesia ie insensibility to heat and pain due to compression of the sensory fibres that cross the cord immediately they enter in the long term there is destruction of motor and sensory tracts leading to spastic paralysis and loss of sensation and reflexes tumours and displaced fragments of fractured vertebrae these may affect the spinal cord and nerve roots at any level the pressure damage initially causes pain and later if the pressure is not relieved there may be loss of sensation and paralysis the areas affected depend on the site of pressure,diseases of the spinal cord can result from conditions that reduce space in the neural canal or intervertebral foramina leading to nerve damage or ischemia these include vertebral fractures tumours and prolapsed intervertebral discs which compress the spinal cord or nerve roots depending on the location and type of damage both motor and sensory neurons can be affected motor neurone disease is a degenerative condition primarily in men aged 6070 where upper and lower motor neurons progressively degenerate leading to muscle weakness paralysis and ultimately respiratory failure a prolapsed intervertebral disc especially common in the lumbar region can cause pain paralysis or nerve damage due to herniation of the discs nucleus pulposus in severe cases it compresses the spinal cord or nerve roots syringomyelia characterized by the dilation of the spinal cords central canal typically affects the cervical region and leads to loss of motor and sensory functions over time including spastic paralysis and insensitivity to heat and pain subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord often caused by vitamin b12 deficiency eg pernicious anemia results in demyelination spastic paralysis and ataxia tumours and vertebral fractures also contribute to spinal cord compression leading to paralysis and sensory loss
diseases of peripheral nerves neuropathies this is a group of diseases of peripheral nerves not associated with inflammation they are classified as parenchymal polyneuropathy several neurones are affected interstitial mononeuropathy a single neurone is usually affected parenchymal neuropathy polyneuropathy or damage to a number of neurones and their myelin sheaths occurs in metabolic or toxic disorders eg nutritional deficiencies eg folic acid vitamins b1 b2 b6 b12 metabolic disorders eg diabetes mellitus chronic diseases eg renal failure hepatic failure carcinoma toxic reactions to eg lead arsenic mercury carbon tetrachloride aniline dyes and some drugs such as phenytoin chloroquine infections eg influenza measles typhoid fever diphtheria leprosy the long neurones are usually affected first eg those supplying the feet and legs the outcome depends upon the cause of the neuropathy and the extent of the damage interstitial neuropathy usually only one neurone is damaged mononeuropathy and the most common cause is ischaemia due to pressure example include pressure applied to cranial nerves in cranial bone foramina due to distortion of the brain by increased icp compression of a nerve in a confined space caused by surrounding inflammation and oedema eg the median nerve in the carpal tunnel see p 427 external pressure on a nerve eg an unconscious person lying with an arm hanging over the side of a bed or trolley compression of the axillary circumflex nerve by illfitting crutches trapping a nerve between the broken ends of a bone ischaemia due to thrombosis of blood vessels supplying a nerve the resultant dysfunction depends on the site and extent of the injury neuritis acute idiopathic inflammatory polyneuropathy guillainbarre syndrome this is a sudden acute progressive bilateral ascending paralysis beginning in the lower limbs and spreading to the arms trunk and cranial nerves it usually occurs 1 to 3 weeks after an upper respiratory tract infection there is widespread inflammation accompanied by some demyelination of spinal peripheral and cranial nerves and the spinal ganglia paralysis may affect all the limbs and the respiratory muscles patients who survive the acute phase usually recover completely in weeks or months bells palsy compression of a facial nerve in the temporal bone foramen causes paralysis of facial muscles with drooping and loss of facial expression on the affected side the immediate cause is inflammation and oedema of the nerve but the underlying cause is unknown the onset may be sudden or develop over several hours distortion of the features is due to muscle tone on the unaffected side the affected side being expressionless recovery is usually complete within a few months developmental abnormalities of the nervous system spina bifida this is a congenital malformation of the neural canal and spinal cord fig 752 the neural arches of the vertebrae are absent and the dura mater is abnormal most commonly in the lumbosacral region the causes are not known although the condition is associated with dietary deficiency of folic acid at the time of conception they may be of genetic origin or due to environmental factors eg irradiation or maternal infection rubella at a critical stage in development of the fetal vertebrae and spinal cord the effects depend on the extent of the abnormality occult spina bifida the skin over the defect is intact and excessive growth of hair over the site may be the only sign of abnormality this is sometimes associated with minor nerve defects that commonly affect the bladder meningocele the skin over the defect is very thin and there is dilatation of the subarachnoid space posteriorly the spinal cord is correctly positioned meningomyelocele the subarachnoid space is dilated posteriorly the spinal cord is displaced backwards and may be adherent to the posterior wall of the arachnoid dilatation the skin is often deficient with leakage of csf and the meninges may become infected serious nerve defects result in paraplegia and lack of sphincter control causing incontinence of urine and faeces there may also be mental retardation,diseases of peripheral nerves encompass various disorders affecting nerve function primarily categorized into neuropathies and neuritis neuropathies are noninflammatory and can be classified as parenchymal polyneuropathy this condition involves multiple neurons and their myelin sheaths often resulting from nutritional deficiencies eg deficiencies in folic acid and vitamins b1 b2 b6 b12 metabolic disorders like diabetes mellitus chronic illnesses such as renal or hepatic failure toxic reactions to substances like lead or arsenic infections including influenza and leprosy interstitial mononeuropathy this type affects a single neuron frequently due to ischaemia from pressure such as compression in carpal tunnel syndrome or external pressure on nerves neuritis involves inflammation of the nerves with notable examples including guillainbarr syndrome characterized by acute ascending paralysis often following a respiratory infection bells palsy where compression of the facial nerve leads to temporary facial paralysis and loss of expression developmental abnormalities such as spina bifida arise from neural tube defects during fetal development often associated with maternal folic acid deficiency impacting motor function and bladder control depending on severity
hearing and the ear the ear is the organ of hearing it is supplied by the 8th cranial nerve ie the cochlear part of the vestibulocochlear nerve which is stimulated by vibrations caused by sound waves with the exception of the auricle pinna the structures that form the ear are encased within the petrous portion of the temporal bone structure the ear is divided into three distinct parts figs 81 and 86 outer ear middle ear tympanic cavity inner ear outer ear the outer ear consists of the auricle pinna and the external acoustic meatus the auricle pinna the auricle is the expanded portion projecting from the side of the head it is composed of fibroelastic cartilage covered with skin it is deeply grooved and ridged and the most prominent outer ridge is the helix the lobule earlobe is the soft pliable part at the lower extremity composed of fibrous and adipose tissue richly supplied with blood external acoustic meatus auditory canal this is a slightly sshaped tube about 25 cm long extending from the auricle to the tympanic membrane eardrum the lateral third is cartilaginous and the remainder is a canal in the temporal bone the meatus is lined with skin containing hairs continuous with that of the auricle there are numerous sebaceous and ceruminous glands in the skin of the lateral third ceruminous glands are modified sweat glands that secrete cerumen wax a sticky material containing lysozyme and immunoglobulins foreign materials eg dust insects and microbes are prevented from reaching the tympanic membrane by wax hairs and the curvature of the meatus movements of the temporomandibular joint during chewing and speaking massage the cartilaginous meatus moving the wax towards the exterior the tympanic membrane eardrum fig 82 completely separates the external acoustic meatus from the middle ear it is ovalshaped with the slightly broader edge upwards and is formed by three types of tissue the outer covering of hairless skin the middle layer of fibrous tissue and the inner lining of mucous membrane continuous with that of the middle ear middle ear tympanic cavity this is an irregularshaped airfilled cavity within the petrous portion of the temporal bone the cavity its contents and the air sacs which open out of it are lined with either simple squamous or cuboidal epithelium the lateral wall of the middle ear is formed by the tympanic membrane the roof and floor are formed by the temporal bone the posterior wall is formed by the temporal bone with openings leading to the mastoid antrum through which air passes to the air cells within the mastoid process the medial wall is a thin layer of temporal bone in which there are two openings oval window round window see fig 86 the oval window is occluded by part of a small bone called the stapes and the round window by a fine sheet of fibrous tissue air reaches the cavity through the pharyngotympanic auditory or eustachian tube which extends from the nasopharynx it is about 4 cm long and is lined with ciliated epithelium the presence of air at atmospheric pressure on both sides of the tympanic membrane is maintained by the pharyngotympanic tube and enables the membrane to vibrate when sound waves strike it the pharyngotympanic tube is normally closed but when there is unequal pressure across the tympanic membrane eg at high altitude it is opened by swallowing or yawning and the ears pop equalising the pressure again auditory ossicles fig 83 these are three very small bones that extend across the middle ear from the tympanic membrane to the oval window fig 81 they form a series of movable joints with each other and with the medial wall of the cavity at the oval window they are named according to their shapes the malleus this is the lateral hammershaped bone the handle is in contact with the tympanic membrane and the head forms a movable joint with the incus the incus this is the middle anvilshaped bone its body articulates with the malleus the long process with the stapes and it is stabilised by the short process fixed by fibrous tissue to the posterior wall of the tympanic cavity the stapes this is the medial stirrupshaped bone its head articulates with the incus and its footplate fits into the oval window the three ossicles are held in position by fine ligaments inner ear fig 84 the inner internal ear or labyrinth meaning maze ear contains the organs of hearing and balance it is generally described in two parts the bony labyrinth and the membranous labyrinth bony labyrinth this is a cavity within the temporal bone lined with periosteum it is larger than and encloses the membranous labyrinth of the same shape which fits into it like a tube within a tube between the bony and membranous labyrinth there is a layer of watery fluid called perilymph and within the membranous labyrinth there is a similarly watery fluid endolymph the bony labyrinth consists of 1 vestibule 1 cochlea 3 semicircular canals the vestibule this is the expanded part nearest the middle ear it contains the oval and round windows in its lateral wall the cochlea this resembles a snails shell it has a broad base where it is continuous with the vestibule and a narrow apex and it spirals round a central bony column the semicircular canals these are three tubes arranged so that one is situated in each of the three planes of space they are continuous with the vestibule membranous labyrinth this contains endolymph and lies within its bony counterpart it comprises the vestibule which contains the utricle and saccule the cochlea three semicircular canals the cochlea a crosssection of the cochlea fig 85 contains three compartments the scala vestibuli the scala media or cochlear duct the scala tympani in crosssection the bony cochlea has two compartments containing perilymph the scala vestibuli which originates at the oval window and the scala tympani which ends at the round window the two compartments are continuous with each other and figure 86 shows the relationship between these structures the cochlear duct is part of the membranous labyrinth and is triangular in shape on the basilar membrane or base of the triangle there are supporting cells and specialised cochlear hair cells containing auditory receptors these cells form the spiral organ of corti the sensory organ that responds to vibration by initiating nerve impulses that are then perceived as hearing by the brain the auditory receptors are dendrites of efferent nerves that combine forming the cochlear auditory part of the vestibulocochlear nerve 8th cranial nerve which passes through a foramen in the temporal bone to reach the hearing area in the temporal lobe of the cerebrum see fig 718 p 151 physiology of hearing every sound produces sound waves or vibrations in the air which travel at about 332 metres 1088 feet per second the auricle because of its shape concentrates the waves and directs them along the auditory meatus causing the tympanic membrane to vibrate tympanic membrane vibrations are transmitted and amplified through the middle ear by movement of the ossicles fig 86 at their medial end the footplate of the stapes rocks to and fro in the oval window setting up fluid waves in the perilymph of the scala vestibuli some of the force of these waves is transmitted along the length of the scala vestibuli and scala tympani but most of the pressure is transmitted into the cochlear duct this causes a corresponding wave motion in the endolymph resulting in vibration of the basilar membrane and stimulation of the auditory receptors in the hair cells of the spiral organ the nerve impulses generated pass to the brain in the cochlear auditory portion of the vestibulocochlear nerve 8th cranial nerve the fluid wave is finally expended into the middle ear by vibration of the membrane of the round window the vestibulocochlear nerve transmits the impulses to the hearing area in the cerebrum where sound is perceived and to various nuclei in the pons and the midbrain sound waves have properties of pitch and volume or intensity fig 87 pitch is determined by the frequency of the sound waves and is measured in hertz hz the volume depends on the amplitude of the sound waves and is measured in decibels db very loud noise is damaging to the ear particularly when prolonged because it damages the sensitive hair cells of the spiral organ because of the structure of the inner ear sounds of different frequencies stimulate the basilar membrane at different places along its length allowing discrimination of pitch additionally the greater the amplitude of the wave created in the endolymph the greater the stimulation of the auditory receptors in the hair cells in the spiral organ enabling perception of volume,the ear is a complex organ responsible for hearing divided into three primary sections the outer ear middle ear and inner ear outer ear this includes the auricle pinna the visible part that captures sound waves and the external acoustic meatus a slightly curved canal about 25 cm long the meatus channels sound to the tympanic membrane eardrum which vibrates in response to sound the skin lining this canal contains hairs and glands that produce earwax which protects the ear by trapping dust and microorganisms middle ear this airfilled cavity houses the auditory ossiclesthe malleus incus and stapeswhich amplify sound vibrations from the tympanic membrane to the oval window the pharyngotympanic tube connects the middle ear to the nasopharynx equalizing pressure to allow the tympanic membrane to function effectively inner ear comprising the bony labyrinth and membranous labyrinth the inner ear contains the cochlea which resembles a spiral shell within it the spiral organ of corti houses hair cells that convert sound vibrations into nerve impulses transmitted via the vestibulocochlear nerve 8th cranial nerve to the brain for sound perception
sight and the eye the eye is the organ of the sense of sight situated in the orbital cavity and it is supplied by the optic nerve 2nd cranial nerve it is almost spherical in shape and is about 25 cm in diameter the space between the eye and the orbital cavity is occupied by adipose tissue the bony walls of the orbit and the fat help to protect the eye from injury structurally the two eyes are separate but unlike the ear some of their activities are coordinated so that they function as a pair it is possible to see with only one eye but threedimensional vision is impaired when only one eye is used especially in relation to the judgement of distance structure fig88 there are three layers of tissue in the walls of the eye they are the outer fibrous layer sclera and cornea the middle vascular layer or uveal tract choroid ciliary body and iris the inner nervous tissue layer retina structures inside the eyeball are the lens aqueous fluid humour and vitreous body humour sclera and cornea the sclera or white of the eye forms the outermost layer of tissue of the posterior and lateral aspects of the eyeball and is continuous anteriorly with the transparent cornea it consists of a firm fibrous membrane that maintains the shape of the eye and gives attachment to the extraocular or extrinsic muscles of the eye p 203 anteriorly the sclera continues as a clear transparent epithelial membrane the cornea light rays pass through the cornea to reach the retina the cornea is convex anteriorly and is involved in refracting or bending light rays to focus them on the retina choroid figs 88 and 89 the choroid lines the posterior fivesixths of the inner surface of the sclera it is very rich in blood vessels and is deep chocolate brown in colour light enters the eye through the pupil stimulates the nerve endings in the retina and is then absorbed by the choroid ciliary body the ciliary body is the anterior continuation of the choroid consisting of ciliary muscle smooth muscle fibres and secretory epithelial cells it gives attachment to the suspensory ligament which at its other end is attached to the capsule enclosing the lens contraction and relaxation of the ciliary muscle changes the thickness of the lens which bends or refracts light rays entering the eye to focus them on the retina the epithelial cells secrete aqueous fluid into the anterior segment of the eye ie the space between the lens and the cornea anterior and posterior chambers the ciliary body is supplied by parasympathetic branches of the oculomotor nerve 3rd cranial nerve stimulation causes contraction of the smooth muscle and accommodation of the eye p 202 iris the iris is the visible coloured part of the eye and extends anteriorly from the ciliary body lying behind the cornea in front of the lens it divides the anterior segment of the eye into anterior and posterior chambers which contain aqueous fluid secreted by the ciliary body it is a circular body composed of pigment cells and two layers of smooth muscle fibres one circular and the other radiating fig 89 in the centre there is an aperture called the pupil the iris is supplied by parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves parasympathetic stimulation constricts the pupil and sympathetic stimulation dilates it see figs 743 and 744 pp 171 and 172 the colour of the iris is genetically determined and depends on the number of pigment cells present albinos have no pigment cells and people with blue eyes have fewer than those with brown eyes lens fig 810 the lens is a highly elastic circular biconvex body lying immediately behind the pupil it consists of fibres enclosed within a capsule and it is suspended from the ciliary body by the suspensory ligament its thickness is controlled by the ciliary muscle through the suspensory ligament the lens bends refracts light rays reflected by objects in front of the eye it is the only structure in the eye that can vary its refractory power achieved by changing its thickness when the ciliary muscle contracts it moves forward releasing its pull on the lens increasing its thickness the nearer is the object being viewed the thicker the lens becomes to allow focusing retina the retina is the innermost layer of the wall of the eye fig 88 it is an extremely delicate structure and is especially adapted for stimulation by light rays it is composed of several layers of nerve cell bodies and their axons lying on a pigmented layer of epithelial cells which attach it to the choroid the layer highly sensitive to light is the layer of sensory receptor cells rods and cones the retina lines about threequarters of the eyeball and is thickest at the back and thins out anteriorly to end just behind the ciliary body near the centre of the posterior part is the macula lutea or yellow spot figs 811 and 812 in the centre of the area there is a little depression called the fovea centralis consisting of only coneshaped cells towards the anterior part of the retina there are fewer cone than rodshaped cells fig 811 the rods and cones contain photosensitive pigments that convert light rays into nerve impulses and this is explained on page 202 about 05 cm to the nasal side of the macula lutea all 198 the nerve fibres of the retina converge to form the optic nerve the small area of retina where the optic nerve leaves the eye is the optic disc or blind spot it has no lightsensitive cells blood supply to the eye the eye is supplied with arterial blood by the ciliary arteries and the central retinal artery these are branches of the ophthalmic artery one of the branches of the internal carotid artery venous drainage is by a number of veins including the central retinal vein which eventually empty into a deep venous sinus the central retinal artery and vein are encased in the optic nerve entering the eye at the optic disc interior of the eye the anterior segment of the eye ie the space between the cornea and the lens is incompletely divided into anterior and posterior chambers by the iris fig 88 both chambers contain a clear aqueous fluid humour secreted into the posterior chamber by ciliary glands it circulates in front of the lens through the pupil into the anterior chamber and returns to the venous circulation through the scleral venous sinus canal of schlemm in the angle between the iris and cornea fig 88 there is continuous production and drainage but the intraocular pressure remains fairly constant between 13 and 26 kpa 10 to 20 mmhg an increase in this pressure causes glaucoma p 210 aqueous fluid supplies nutrients and removes waste from the transparent structures in the front of the eye that have no blood supply ie the cornea lens and lens capsule behind the lens and filling the posterior segment cavity of the eyeball is the vitreous body humour this is a soft colourless transparent jellylike substance composed of 99 water some salts and mucoprotein it maintains sufficient intraocular pressure to support the retina against the choroid and prevent the walls of the eyeball from collapsing the eye keeps its shape because of the intraocular pressure exerted by the vitreous body and the aqueous fluid it remains fairly constant throughout life optic nerves second cranial nerves fig 813 the fibres of the optic nerve originate in the retina of the eye all the fibres converge to form the optic nerve about 05 cm to the nasal side of the macula lutea the nerve pierces the choroid and sclera to pass backwards and medially through the orbital cavity it then passes through the optic foramen of the sphenoid bone backwards and medially to meet the nerve from the other eye at the optic chiasma optic chiasma this is situated immediately in front of and above the pituitary gland which is in the hypophyseal fossa of the sphenoid bone see fig 92 p 215 in the optic chiasma the nerve fibres of the optic nerve from the nasal side of each retina cross over to the opposite side the fibres from the temporal side do not cross but continue backwards on the same side this crossing over provides both cerebral hemispheres with sensory input from each eye optic tracts these are the pathways of the optic nerves posterior to the optic chiasma each tract consists of the nasal fibres from the retina of one eye and the temporal fibres from the retina of the other the optic tracts pass backwards through the cerebrum to synapse with nerve cells of the lateral geniculate bodies of the thalamus from there the nerve fibres proceed backwards and medially as the optic radiations to terminate in the visual area of the cerebral cortex in the occipital lobes of the cerebrum other neurones originating in the lateral geniculate bodies convey impulses from the eyes to the cerebellum where together with impulses from the semicircular canals of the ears and from the skeletal muscles and joints they contribute to the maintenance of posture and balance,the eye is a complex organ responsible for the sense of sight located in the orbital cavity and measures about 25 cm in diameter it has three distinct layers outer layer the sclera is the tough white part that protects and maintains the eyes shape while the cornea a transparent layer at the front refracts light entering the eye helping to focus it on the retina middle layer the choroid is rich in blood vessels and absorbs excess light providing nourishment the ciliary body connects to the lens via the suspensory ligament and adjusts the lens shape for focusing on objects at varying distances the iris the colored part of the eye contains muscles that control the pupils size regulating how much light enters inner layer the retina is lined with photoreceptor cellsrods for lowlight vision and cones for color visionconverting light into nerve impulses the macula lutea is a specialized area for sharp vision visual information travels through the optic nerve to the brain where it is processed at the optic chiasma and optic tracts enabling depth perception and clarity the aqueous humor maintains intraocular pressure while the vitreous body supports the retina
physiology of sight light waves travel at a speed of 186 000 miles 300 000 kilometres per second light is reflected into the eyes by objects within the field of vision white light is a combination of all the colours of the visual spectrum rainbow ie red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet this is demonstrated by passing white light through a glass prism which refracts or bends the rays of the different colours to a greater or lesser extent depending on their wavelengths fig 814 red light has the longest wavelength and violet the shortest this range of colour is the spectrum of visible light in a rainbow white light from the sun is broken up by raindrops which act as prisms and reflectors the electromagnetic spectrum the electromagnetic spectrum is broad but only a small part is visible to the human eye fig 815 beyond the long end there are infrared waves heat microwaves and radio waves beyond the short end there are ultraviolet uv xrays and gamma rays uv light is not normally visible because it is absorbed by a yellow pigment in the lens following removal of the lens cataract extraction uv light is visible and it has been suggested that longterm exposure may damage the retina a specific colour is perceived when only one wavelength is reflected by the object and all the others are absorbed eg an object appears red when only the red wavelength is reflected objects appear white when all wavelengths are reflected and black when they are all absorbed in order to achieve clear vision light reflected from objects within the visual field is focused on to the retina of each eye the processes involved in producing a clear image are refraction of the light rays changing the size of the pupils and accommodation of the eyes although these may be considered as separate processes effective vision is dependent upon their coordination refraction of the light rays when light rays pass from a medium of one density to a medium of a different density they are refracted or bent for example in the eye the biconvex lens bends and focuses light rays fig 816 this principle is used to focus light on the retina before reaching the retina light rays pass successively through the conjunctiva cornea aqueous fluid lens and vitreous body they are all more dense than air and with the exception of the lens they have a constant refractory power similar to that of water abnormal refraction within the eye is corrected using biconvex or biconcave lenses which are shown on page 212 lens the lens is a biconvex elastic transparent body suspended behind the iris from the ciliary body by the suspensory ligament it is the only structure in the eye that changes its refractive power light rays entering the eye need to be bent refracted to focus them on the retina light from distant objects needs least refraction and as the object comes closer the amount of refraction needed is increased to increase the refractive power the ciliary muscle contracts releasing its pull on the suspensory ligament and the anterior surface of the lens bulges forward increasing its convexity this focuses light rays from near objects on the retina when the ciliary muscle relaxes it slips backwards increasing its pull on the suspensory ligament making the lens thinner fig 817 this focuses light rays from distant objects on the retina size of the pupils pupil size influences accommodation by controlling the amount of light entering the eye in a bright light the pupils are constricted in a dim light they are dilated if the pupils were dilated in a bright light too much light would enter the eye and damage the sensitive retina in a dim light if the pupils were constricted insufficient light would enter the eye to activate the photosensitive pigments in the rods and cones which stimulate the nerve endings in the retina the iris consists of one layer of circular and one of radiating smooth muscle fibres contraction of the circular fibres constricts the pupil and contraction of the radiating fibres dilates it the size of the pupil is controlled by the autonomic nervous system sympathetic stimulation dilates the pupils and parasympathetic stimulation causes constriction accommodation of the eyes to light figs 817 and 818 close vision in order to focus on near objects ie within about 6 metres the eye must make the following adjustments constriction of the pupils convergence of the eyeballs changing the power of the lens constriction of the pupils this assists accommodation by reducing the width of the beam of light entering the eye so that it passes through the central curved part of the lens convergence movement of the eyeballs light rays from nearby objects enter the two eyes at different angles and for clear vision they must stimulate corresponding areas of the two retinae extraocular muscles move the eyes and to obtain a clear image they rotate the eyes so that they converge on the object viewed this coordinated muscle activity is under autonomic control when there is voluntary movement of the eyes both eyes move and convergence is maintained the nearer an object is to the eyes the greater the eye rotation needed to achieve convergence eg an individual focusing near the tip of his nose appears to be crosseyed if convergence is not complete the eyes are focused on different objects or on different points of the same object there are then two images sent to the brain and this leads to double vision diplopia after a period of time during which convergence is not possible the brain tends to ignore the impulses received from the divergent eye see squint p 211 changing the power of the lens changes in the thickness of the lens are made to focus light on the retina the amount of adjustment depends on the distance of the object from the eyes ie the lens is thicker for near vision and at its thinnest when focusing on objects at more than 6 metres distance fig 817 looking at near objects tires the eyes more quickly owing to the continuous use of the ciliary muscle distant vision objects more than 6 metres away from the eyes are focused on the retina without adjustment of the lens or convergence of the eyes functions of the retina the retina is the photosensitive part of the eye the lightsensitive nerve cells are the rods and cones and their distribution in the retina is shown in figure 811a light rays cause chemical changes in photosensitive pigments in these cells and they generate nerve impulses which are conducted to the occipital lobes of the cerebrum via the optic nerves the rods are more sensitive than the cones they are stimulated by lowintensity or dim light eg by the dim light in the interior of a darkened room the cones are sensitive to bright light and colour the different wavelengths of visible light stimulate photosensitive pigments in the cones resulting in the perception of different colours in bright light the light rays are focused on the macula lutea the rods are more numerous towards the periphery of the retina visual purple rhodopsin is a photosensitive pigment present only in the rods it is bleached degraded by bright light and is quickly regenerated when an adequate supply of vitamin a is available p 274 dark adaptation when exposed to bright light the rhodopsin within the sensitive rods is completely degraded this is not significant until the individual moves into a darkened area where the light intensity is insufficient to stimulate the cones and temporary visual impairment results whilst the rhodopsin is being regenerated within the rods dark adaptation when regeneration of rhodopsin occurs normal sight returns it is easier to see a dim star in the sky at night if the head is turned slightly away from it because light of low intensity is then focused on an area of the retina where there is a greater concentration of rods if looked at directly the light intensity of a dim star is not sufficient to stimulate the less sensitive cones in the area of the macula lutea in dim evening light different colours cannot be distinguished because the light intensity is insufficient to stimulate coloursensitive pigments in cones breakdown and regeneration of the visual pigments in cones is similar to that of rods binocular vision fig 819 binocular or stereoscopic vision has certain advantages each eye sees a scene slightly differently there is an overlap in the middle but the left eye sees more on the left than can be seen by the other eye and vice versa the images from the two eyes are fused in the cerebrum so that only one image is perceived binocular vision provides a much more accurate assessment of one object relative to another eg its distance depth height and width people with monocular vision may find it difficult for example to judge the speed and distance of an approaching vehicle,light waves travel at 186000 miles 300000 kilometers per second allowing us to perceive our environment when light reflects off objects it enters the eye where white lighta combination of all colorscan be separated into the visible spectrum red orange yellow green blue indigo violet using a prism the electromagnetic spectrum includes a range of wavelengths but only a small portion is visible to humans uv light is usually absorbed by the lens for clear vision light must focus on the retina through a process involving refraction pupil size adjustment and eye accommodation the lens a biconvex structure changes shape to bend light appropriately ciliary muscles control this by contracting for near objects and relaxing for distant ones pupil size varies constricting in bright light and dilating in dim light the retina contains rods which are sensitive to low light and cones which detect bright light and color sending nerve impulses to the brain dark adaptation occurs when moving from bright to dark environments as rhodopsin regenerates in the rods binocular vision enhances depth perception allowing us to assess distance and size more accurately
sense of smell the nasal cavity has a dual function a passageway for respiration ch 10 and sense of smell olfactory nerves first cranial nerves these are the sensory nerves of smell they originate as specialised olfactory nerve endings chemoreceptors in the mucous membrane of the roof of the nasal cavity above the superior nasal conchae fig 823 on each side of the nasal septum nerve fibres pass through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone to the olfactory bulb where interconnections and synapses occur fig 824 from the bulb bundles of nerve fibres form the olfactory tract which passes backwards to the olfactory area in the temporal lobe of the cerebral cortex in each hemisphere where the impulses are interpreted and odour perceived physiology of smell the sense of smell in human beings is generally less acute than in other animals many animals are known to secrete odorous chemicals called pheromones that play an important part in chemical communication in for example territorial behaviour mating and the bonding of mothers and their newborn offspring the role of pheromones in human communication is unknown all odorous materials give off volatile molecules which are carried into the nose with the inhaled air and stimulate the olfactory chemoreceptors when dissolved in mucus the air entering the nose is warmed and convection currents carry eddies of inspired air to the roof of the nasal cavity sniffing concentrates volatile molecules in the roof of the nose this increases the number of olfactory receptors stimulated and thus the perception of the smell the sense of smell may affect the appetite if the odours are pleasant the appetite may improve and vice versa when accompanied by the sight of food an appetising smell increases salivation and stimulates the digestive system ch 12 the sense of smell may create longlasting memories especially to distinctive odours eg hospital smells favourite or leastliked foods inflammation of the nasal mucosa prevents odorous substances from reaching the olfactory area of the nose causing loss of the sense of smell anosmia the usual cause is the common cold adaptation when an individual is continuously exposed to an odour perception of the odour decreases and ceases within a few minutes this loss of perception only affects that specific odour and adaptation probably occurs both in the cerebrum and in the sensory receptors in the nasal cavity sense of taste taste buds contain sensory receptors chemoreceptors that are found in the papillae of the tongue and widely distributed in the epithelia of the tongue soft palate pharynx and epiglottis they consist of small sensory nerve endings of the glossopharyngeal facial and vagus nerves cranial nerves vii ix and x some of the cells have hairlike microvilli on their free border projecting towards tiny pores in the epithelium fig 825 the sensory receptors are stimulated by chemicals that enter the pores dissolved in saliva nerve impulses are generated and conducted along the glossopharyngeal facial and vagus nerves before synapsing in the medulla and thalamus their final destination is the taste area in the parietal lobe of the cerebral cortex where taste is perceived see fig 718 p 151 physiology of taste four fundamental sensations of taste have been described sweet sour bitter and salt this is probably an oversimplification because perception varies widely and many tastes cannot be easily classified however some tastes consistently stimulate taste buds in specific parts of the tongue see fig 1212 p 290 sweet and salty mainly at the tip sour at the sides bitter at the back the sense of taste triggers salivation and the secretion of gastric juice ch 12 it also has a protective function eg when foultasting food is eaten then reflex gagging or vomiting may be induced the sense of taste is impaired when the mouth is dry because substances can be tasted only if they are in solution,the sense of taste is facilitated by taste buds which are specialized sensory receptors located in the papillae of the tongue as well as the soft palate and pharynx these chemoreceptors respond to chemical substances that dissolve in saliva allowing for the perception of taste when these substances stimulate the taste buds nerve impulses are generated and transmitted via the glossopharyngeal facial and vagus nerves these impulses travel to the medulla and thalamus before reaching the taste area in the parietal lobe of the cerebral cortex where the sensation of taste is ultimately perceived taste is categorized into four fundamental sensations sweet and salty tastes are primarily detected at the tip of the tongue sour tastes are sensed on the sides while bitter tastes are recognized at the back the sense of taste triggers salivation and the secretion of gastric juices promoting digestion it also serves a protective role for instance foultasting substances can induce gagging or vomiting to prevent ingestion additionally taste perception can be impaired when the mouth is dry as only dissolved substances can be effectively tasted
diseases of the ear external otitis infection by stophylococcus aureus is the usual cause of localised inflammation boils in the external auditory meatus when more generalised the inflammation may be caused by bacteria or fungi or by an allergic reaction to eg dandruff soaps hair sprays hair dyes acute otitis media this is inflammation of the middle ear cavity usually caused by upward spread of microbes from an upper respiratory tract infection via the auditory tube it is very common in children and is accompanied by severe earache on the affected side occasionally it spreads from the outer ear through a perforation in the tympanic membrane microbial infection leads to the accumulation of pus and the outward bulging of the tympanic membrane sometimes there is rupture of the tympanic membrane and purulent discharge from the ear otorrhoea the spread of infection may cause mastoiditis and labyrinthitis as the petrous portion of the temporal bone is very thin the infection may spread through the bone and cause meningitis and brain abscess serous otitis media also known as glue ear or secretory otitis media this is a collection of fluid effusion in the middle ear cavity causes include obstruction of the auditory tube by for example pharyngeal swelling enlarged adenoids or tumour barotrauma usually caused by descent in an aeroplane when suffering from a cold untreated acute otitis media in adults the individual suffers from deafness and usually painless blockage of the ear whereas young children show delay in speech development and behavioural disorders owing to deafness air already present in the middle ear is absorbed and a negative pressure develops at first there is retraction of the tympanic membrane then fluid is drawn into the lowpressure cavity from surrounding blood vessels conductive hearing loss occurs and there may or may not be secondary infection this is a common cause of hearing impairment in children chronic otitis media in this condition there is permanent perforation of the tympanic membrane following acute otitis media especially when recurrent persistent or untreated and mechanical or blast injuries during the healing process stratified epithelium from the outer ear sometimes grows into the middle ear forming a cholesteatoma this is a collection of desquamated epithelial cells and purulent material continued development of cholesteatoma may lead to destruction of the ossicles and conduction deafness erosion of the roof of the middle ear and meningitis spread of infection to the inner ear that may cause labyrinthitis otosclerosis this is a common cause of progressive conductive hearing loss in young adults that may affect one ear but is more commonly bilateral it is usually hereditary more common in females than males and often worsens during pregnancy abnormal bone develops around the footplate of the stapes fusing it to the oval window reducing the ability to transmit sound waves across the tympanic cavity presbycusis this form of hearing impairment commonly accompanies the ageing process degenerative changes in the sensory cells of the spiral organ of corti result in sensorineural perceptive deafness perception of highfrequency sound is impaired first and later lowfrequency sound may also be affected the individual develops difficulty in discrimination eg following a conversation especially in the presence of background noise menieres disease in this condition there is accumulation of endolymph causing distension and increased pressure within the membranous labyrinth with destruction of the sensory cells in the ampulla and cochlea it is usually unilateral at first but both ears may be affected later the cause is not known menieres disease is associated with recurrent episodes of incapacitating dizziness vertigo nausea and vomiting lasting for several hours periods of remission vary from days to months during and between attacks there may be continuous ringing in the affected ear tinnitus loss of hearing is experienced during episodes and permanent hearing impairment may gradually develop over a period of years as the spiral organ of corti is destroyed labyrinthitis this may be caused by development of a fistula from a cholesteatoma see above or rarely by spread of infection from the middle ear in some cases the spiral organ is destroyed causing sudden total nerve deafness in the affected ear motion sickness repetitive motion causes excessive stimulation of the semicircular canals and vestibular apparatus and results in nausea and vomiting in some people deafness hearing impairment can be classified in two main categories conductive and sensorineural common causes are shown in box 81 hearing impairment can also be mixed when there is a combination of conductive and sensorineural deafness in one ear conductive deafness this is due to impaired transmission of sound waves from the outside to the oval window ie an abnormality of the outer or middle ear sensorineural perceptive deafness this is the result of disease of the cochlea the cochlear branch of the vestibular nerve or the hearing area of the brain the individual usually perceives noise but cannot discriminate between sounds ie hears but cannot understand risk factors for congenital deafness include family history of hereditary deafness viruses eg maternal rubella during the first 3 months of pregnancy acute hypoxia at birth,diseases of the ear ear diseases can impact hearing and balance significantly external otitis inflammation of the external auditory canal typically caused by staphylococcus aureus bacteria fungi or allergens such as soaps acute otitis media common in children this middle ear inflammation arises from upper respiratory infections it results in severe earache pus accumulation and possible tympanic membrane rupture leading to discharge otorrhea serous otitis media also known as glue ear this condition involves fluid buildup in the middle ear causing conductive hearing loss causes include auditory tube obstruction and untreated infections chronic otitis media this persistent condition involves tympanic membrane perforation and can lead to cholesteatoma causing erosion of ear structures and complications such as meningitis otosclerosis a hereditary condition causing progressive conductive hearing loss due to abnormal bone growth around the stapes presbycusis agerelated hearing loss due to sensory cell degeneration initially affecting highfrequency sounds menieres disease characterized by endolymph accumulation leading to vertigo tinnitus and gradual hearing loss labyrinthitis inflammation that can cause sudden total nerve deafness deafness classified as conductive or sensorineural impacting sound transmission or processing
diseases of the eye inflammation stye hordeolum this is an acute and painful bacterial infection of sebaceous or tarsal glands of the eyelid margin a crop of styes may occur due to localised spread to adjacent glands infection of tarsal glands may block their ducts leading to cyst formation chalaziori which may damage the cornea the most common infecting organism is staphylococcus aureus blepharitis this is chronic inflammation of the eyelid margins which is usually caused by microbes or allergy eg staphylococcal infection or seborrhoea excessive sebaceous gland secretion if ulceration occurs healing by fibrosis may distort the eyelid margins preventing complete closure of the eye this may lead to drying of the eye conjunctivitis and possibly corneal ulceration conjunctivitis inflammation of the conjunctiva may be caused by irritants such as smoke dust wind cold or dry air microbes or antigens corneal ulceration see below is a rare complication microbial infection in adults this is usually caused by strains of staphylococci streptococci pneumococci and haemophilus neonatal conjunctivitis this occurs within 28 days of birth and is commonly caused by neisseria gonorrhoea chlamydia trachomatis or herpes simplex virus it is usually acquired when microbes contaminate the babys eyes during delivery infection may cause corneal ulceration see below allergic conjunctivitis this may be a complication of hay fever or be caused by a wide variety of airborne antigens eg dust pollen fungus spores animal dander cosmetics hair sprays soaps the condition sometimes becomes chronic trachoma this is a chronic inflammatory condition caused by chlamydia trachomatis in which fibrous tissue forms in the conjunctiva and cornea leading to eyelid deformity and is a common cause of blindness in tropical countries the microbes are spread by flies communal use of contaminated washing water crossinfection between mother and child contaminated towels and clothing corneal ulcer this is local necrosis of corneal tissue usually associated with corneal infection keratitis following trauma eg abrasion or infection spread from the conjunctiva or eyelids common infecting microbes include staphylococci pneumococci and herpes simplex viruses acute pain injection redness of the cornea photophobia and lacrimation interfere with sight during the acute phase in severe cases extensive ulceration or perforation and healing by fibrosis can cause opacity of the cornea and irreversible loss of sight inflammation of the uveal tract iris ciliary body choroid anterior uveitis iritis iridocyclitis iridocyclitis inflammation of iris and ciliary body is the more common and it may be acute or chronic the infection may have spread from the outer eye but in most cases the cause is unknown there is usually moderate to severe pain redness blurring of vision lacrimation and photophobia in severe cases adhesions form between the iris and lens capsule preventing the circulation of aqueous fluid in the posterior and anterior chambers this may cause the lens to bulge and occlude the scleral venous sinus canal of schlemm raising intraocular pressure causing chronic closedangle glaucoma see below acute infection usually resolves in several days or weeks while the chronic form may last for months or years posterior uveitis choroiditis chorioretinitis this affects the posterior segment of the eye and chorioretinitis is the more common condition it may be caused by spread of infection from the anterior segment front of the eye or be secondary to a wide variety of systemic conditions including rheumatoid arthritis reiters syndrome inflammatory bowel disease and brucellosis complications of uveitis include retinal detachment due to accumulation of inflammatory exudate secondary glaucoma cataract glaucoma this is a group of conditions in which there is increased intraocular pressure due to impaired drainage of aqueous fluid through the scleral venous sinus canal of schlemm in the angle between the iris and cornea in the anterior chamber persistently raised intraocular pressure may damage the optic nerve by mechanical compression of the axons compression of the blood supply causing ischaemia of the axons damage to the optic nerve impairs vision and the extent varies from some visual impairment to complete blindness primary glaucomas chronic openangle glaucoma there is a gradual painless rise in intraocular pressure with progressive loss of vision peripheral vision is lost first but may not be noticed until only central tunnel vision remains as the condition progresses atrophy of the optic disc occurs leading to irreversible blindness it is commonly bilateral and occurs mostly in people over 40 years of age the cause is not known but there is a familial tendency acute closedangle glaucoma this is most common in people over 40 years of age and usually affects one eye during life the lens gradually increases in size pushing the iris forward in dim light when the pupil dilates the lax iris bulges still further forward and may come into contact with the cornea blocking the scleral venous sinus canal of schlemm suddenly raising the intraocular pressure sudden severe pain photophobia lacrimation and loss of vision accompany an acute attack it may resolve spontaneously if the iris responds to bright light constricting the pupil and releasing the pressure on the scleral venous sinus after repeated attacks spontaneous recovery may be incomplete and vision is progressively impaired chronic closedangle glaucoma the intraocular pressure rises gradually without symptoms peripheral vision deteriorates first followed by atrophy of the optic disc and blindness congenital glaucoma this abnormal development of the anterior chamber is often familial or due to maternal infection with rubella in early pregnancy secondary glaucoma the most common primary disorder is anterior uveitis with the formation of adhesions see above other predisposing primary conditions include intraocular tumours enlarged cataracts central retinal vein occlusion intraocular haemorrhage trauma to the eye strabismus squint crosseye this is the inability of the eyes to move together so that the same image falls on the corresponding parts of the retina in both eyes the result is that two images are sent to the brain one from each eye instead of one integrated image it is caused by extraocular muscle weakness or defective nerve supply to the muscle ie defective cranial nerves iii iv or vi in most cases the image falling on the squinting eye is suppressed by the brain otherwise there is double vision diplopia cataract this is opacity of the lens which may be agerelated or congenital bilateral or unilateral in agerelated cataract there is gradual development of lens opacity that usually develops during older age as the result of exposure to a variety of predisposing factors including uv light xrays cigarette smoke diabetes mellitus ocular trauma uveitis systemic drug therapy eg corticosteroids chlorpromazine congenital cataract may be due to genetic abnormality eg downs syndrome or maternal infection in early pregnancy eg rubella early treatment is required to prevent permanent blindness the extent of visual impairment depends on the location and extent of the opacity retinopathies vascular retinopathies occlusion of the central retinal artery or vein causes sudden painless unilateral loss of vision arterial occlusion is usually due to embolism from eg atheromatous plaques endocarditis retinal artery sclerosis venous occlusion is usually associated with arteriosclerosis in the elderly or with venous thrombosis elsewhere in the body the retinal veins become distended and retinal haemorrhages occur predisposing factors include glaucoma diabetes mellitus hypertension increased blood viscosity diabetic retinopathy this occurs in type i and type ii diabetes mellitus p 234 and changes in retinal blood vessels are associated more with the duration of diabetes than with its severity capillary microaneurysms develop and later there may be proliferation of blood vessels haemorrhages fibrosis and secondary retinal detachment may occur leading to retinal degeneration and loss of vision retinopathy of prematurity previously known as retrolental fibroplasia this condition affects premature babies known risk factors include birth before 32 weeks gestation birth weight less than 1500 g requirement for oxygen therapy apnoea and sepsis there is abnormal development of retinal blood vessels and formation of fibrovascular tissue in the vitreous body causing varying degrees of interference with light transmission in severe cases there may also be haemorrhage in the vitreous body retinal detachment and blindness retinal detachment this painless condition occurs when a tear or hole in the retina allows fluid to accumulate between the layers of retinal cells or between the retina and choroid it is usually localised at first but as fluid collects the detachment spreads there are spots before the eyes flashing lights due to abnormal stimulation of sensory cells and progressive loss of vision sometimes described as a shadow or curtain in many cases the cause is unknown but it may be associated with trauma to the eye or head tumours haemorrhage cataract surgery when the pressure in the eye is reduced or diabetic retinopathy retinitis pigmentosa this is an hereditary disease in which there is degeneration of the retina mainly affecting the rods defective vision in dim light usually becomes apparent in early childhood leading to tunnel vision and eventually blindness keratomalacia in this condition there is corneal ulceration usually with secondary infection the lacrimal glands and conjunctiva may be involved it is caused by chronic vitamin a and protein deficiency in the diet there may be softening or even perforation of the cornea night blindness defective adaptation to dim light is usually an early sign of deficiency of vitamin a which is required for the regeneration of rhodopsin visual purple after it has been exposed to light tumours choroidal malignant melanoma this is the most common ocular malignancy and it occurs between 40 and 70 years of age vision is not normally affected until the tumour causes retinal detachment or secondary glaucoma usually when well advanced the tumour spreads locally in the choroid and bloodborne metastases develop mainly in the liver retinoblastoma this is a malignant tumour derived from embryonic retinal cells a small number of cases are familial it is usually evident before the age of 4 years and may be bilateral the condition presents with a squint and enlargement of the eye as the tumour grows visual impairment develops and the pupil looks pale it spreads locally to the vitreous body and may grow along the optic nerve invading the brain,eye diseases include various conditions impacting vision and overall eye health a stye is a painful acute bacterial infection of the eyelids glands while blepharitis is a chronic inflammation of eyelid margins due to bacteria or allergies potentially causing fibrosis and eye dryness conjunctivitis inflammation of the eyes outer layer arises from irritants microbes or allergies neonatal forms are often contracted during birth corneal ulcers result from infections or trauma risking severe damage and vision loss uveitis affects the uveal tract with anterior types causing pain and potential glaucoma while posterior types relate to systemic illnesses like arthritis glaucoma involves elevated intraocular pressure that damages the optic nerve with types including gradual openangle and sudden closedangle strabismus misaligned eyes disrupts coordinated vision and cataracts are lens opacities that obstruct light linked to age uv exposure or congenital issues retinopathies such as diabetic and premature retinopathies impair blood flow to the retina sometimes leading to retinal detachment retinal detachment occurs when retinal layers separate causing progressive vision loss retinitis pigmentosa degenerates the retina affecting night vision choroidal melanoma and retinoblastoma are malignant eye tumors that may cause blindness and spread emphasizing the need for early detection
the endocrine system the endocrine system consists of glands widely separated from each other with no direct anatomical links fig 91 endocrine glands consist of groups of secretory cells surrounded by an extensive network of capillaries which facilitates diffusion of hormones chemical messengers from the secretory cells into the bloodstream they are commonly referred to as the ductless glands because the hormones are secreted and diffuse directly into the bloodstream a hormone is formed in one organ or gland and carried in the blood to another organ target organ or tissue probably quite distant where it influences cellular activity especially growth and metabolism most hormones are synthesised from amino acids amines polypeptides and proteins see p 23 or are cholesterolbased lipids steroids homeostasis of the internal environment is maintained partly by the autonomic nervous system and partly by the endocrine system the autonomic nervous system is concerned with rapid changes while hormones of the endocrine system are mainly involved in slower and more precise adjustments the endocrine system consists of a number of distinct glands and some tissues in other organs although the hypothalamus is classified as a part of the brain and not as an endocrine gland it controls the pituitary gland and has an indirect effect on many others the endocrine glands are 1 pituitary gland 1 thyroid gland 4 parathyroid glands 2 adrenal suprarenal glands the pancreatic islets islets of langerhans 1 pineal gland or body 1 thymus gland 2 ovaries in the female 2 testes in the male the ovaries and the testes secrete hormones associated with the reproductive system after puberty their functions are described in chapter 19 when a hormone arrives at its target cell it binds to a specific area the receptor where it acts as a switch influencing chemical or metabolic reactions inside the cell the receptors for watersoluble hormones are situated on the cell membrane and those for lipidsoluble hormones are inside the cell examples are shown in box 91 the level of a hormone in the blood is variable and selfregulating within its normal range a hormone is released in response to a specific stimulus and usually its action reverses or negates the stimulus through a negative feedback mechanism see p 6 this may be controlled either indirectly through the release of hormones by the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary gland eg steroid and thyroid hormones or directly by blood levels of the stimulus eg insulin and glucagon the effect of a positive feedback mechanism is amplification of the stimulus and increasing release of the hormone until a particular process is complete and the stimulus ceases eg release of oxytocin during labour pp 7 and 218 pituitary gland and hypothalamus the pituitary gland hypophysis and the hypothalamus act as a unit regulating the activity of most of the other endocrine glands the pituitary gland lies in the hypophyseal fossa of the sphenoid bone below the hypothalamus to which it is attached by a stalk fig 92 it is the size of a pea weighs about 500 mg and consists of three distinct parts that originate from different types of cells the anterior pituitary adenohypophysis is an upgrowth of glandular epithelium from the pharynx and the posterior pituitary neurohypophysis is a downgrowth of nervous tissue from the brain there is a network of nerve fibres between the hypothalamus and the posterior pituitary between these lobes there is a thin strip of tissue called the intermediate lobe and its function in humans is not known blood supply arterial blood this is supplied by branches from the internal carotid artery the anterior lobe is supplied indirectly by blood that has already passed through a capillary bed in the hypothalamus but the posterior lobe is supplied directly venous blood this comes from both lobes containing hormones and leaves the gland in short veins that enter the venous sinuses between the layers of dura mater the influence of the hypothalamus on the pituitary gland the influence of the hypothalamus on the release of hormones is different in the anterior and posterior lobes of the pituitary gland the anterior pituitary this is supplied indirectly with arterial blood that has already passed through a capillary bed in the hypothalamus fig 93a this network of blood vessels forms part of the pituitary portal system which transports blood from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary where it enters thinwalled vascular sinusoids and is in very close contact with the secretory cells as well as providing oxygen and nutrients this blood transports releasing and inhibiting hormones secreted by the hypothalamus these hormones influence secretion and release of other hormones formed in the anterior pituitary the releasing and inhibiting hormones that stimulate and inhibit secretion of specific anterior pituitary hormones are shown in table 91 the posterior pituitary this is formed from nervous tissue and consists of nerve cells surrounded by supporting cells called pituicytes these neurones have their cell bodies in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus and their axons form a bundle known as the hypothalamohypophyseal tract fig 93a posterior pituitary hormones are synthesised in the nerve cell bodies transported along the axons and then stored in vesicles within the axon terminals fig 93b their release by exocytosis is triggered by nerve impulses from the hypothalamus anterior pituitary some of the hormones secreted by the anterior lobe adenohypophysis stimulate or inhibit secretion by other endocrine glands target glands while others have a direct effect on target tissues table 91 summarises the main relationships between the hormones of the hypothalamus the anterior pituitary and target glands or tissues the release of an anterior pituitary hormone follows stimulation of the gland by a specific releasing hormone produced by the hypothalamus and conveyed to the gland through the pituitary portal system of blood vessels the whole system is controlled by a negative feedback mechanism that is when there is a low level of a hormone in the blood supplying the hypothalamus it produces the appropriate releasing hormone which stimulates release of a trophic hormone by the anterior pituitary this in turn stimulates the target gland to produce and release its hormone as a result the blood level of that hormone rises and inhibits the secretion of releasing factor by the hypothalamus fig 94 growth hormone gh this is the most abundant hormone synthesised by the anterior pituitary it stimulates growth and division of most body cells but especially those in the bones and skeletal muscles it also regulates aspects of metabolism in many organs eg liver intestines and pancreas stimulates protein synthesis promotes breakdown of fats and increases blood glucose levels see ch 12 its release is stimulated by growth hormone releasing hormone ghrh and suppressed by growth hormone release inhibiting hormone ghrih both of which are secreted by the hypothalamus secretion of gh is greater at night during sleep although hypoglycaemia exercise and anxiety also stimulate release the daily amount secreted peaks in adolescence and then declines with age inhibition of gh secretion occurs by a negative feedback mechanism when the blood level rises and also when ghrih somatostatin is released by the hypothalamus ghrih also suppresses secretion of tsh and gastrointestinal secretions eg gastric juice gastrin and cholecystokinin see ch 12 thyroid stimulating hormone tsh this hormone is synthesised by the anterior pituitary and its release is stimulated by trh from the hypothalamus it stimulates growth and activity of the thyroid gland which secretes the hormones thyroxine t4 and triiodothyronine t3 release is lowest in the early evening and highest during the night secretion is regulated by a negative feedback mechanism fig 94 when the blood level of thyroid hormones is high secretion of tsh is reduced and vice versa adrenocorticotrophic hormone corticotrophin acth corticotrophin releasing hormone crh from the hypothalamus promotes the synthesis and release of acth by the anterior pituitary this increases the concentration of cholesterol and steroids within the adrenal context and the output of steroid hormones especially cortisol acth levels are highest at about 8 am and fall to their lowest about midnight although high levels sometimes occur at midday and 6 pm this circadian rhythm is maintained throughout life it is associated with the sleep pattern and adjustment to changes takes several days following eg shift work changes travel to a different time zone jet lag secretion is also regulated by a negative feedback mechanism being suppressed when the blood level of acth rises fig 94 other factors that stimulate secretion include hypoglycaemia exercise and other stressors eg emotional states and fever prolactin this hormone stimulates lactation milk production and has a direct effect on the breasts immediately after parturition childbirth the blood level of prolactin is stimulated by prolactin releasing hormone prh released from the hypothalamus and it is lowered by prolactin inhibiting hormone pih dopamine and by an increased blood level of prolactin after birth suckling stimulates prolactin secretion and lactation the resultant high blood level is a factor in reducing the incidence of conception during lactation prolactin together with oestrogens corticosteroids insulin and thyroxine is involved in initiating and maintaining lactation prolactin secretion is related to sleep ie it is raised during any period of sleep night or day emotional stress increases production gonadotrophins after puberty two gonadotrophins sex hormones are secreted by the anterior pituitary in response to luteinising hormone releasing hormone lhrh also known as gonadotrophin releasing hormone gnrh in both males and females these are follicle stimulating hormone fsh luteinising hormone lh in both sexes fsh stimulates production of gametes ova or spermatozoa in females lh and fsh are involved in secretion of the hormones oestrogen and progesterone during the menstrual cycle see figs 198 and 199 pp 444 and 445 as the levels of oestrogen and progesterone rise secretion of lh and fsh is suppressed in males lh also called interstitial cell stimulating hormone icsh stimulates the interstitial cells of the testes to secrete the hormone testosterone see ch 19 table 92 summarises the hormonal secretions of the anterior pituitary posterior pituitary the structure of the posterior pituitary gland and its relationship with the hypothalamus is explained on page 215 oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone adh or vasopressin are the hormones synthesised in the hypothalamus and then released from the axon terminals within the posterior pituitary gland fig 93b these hormones act directly on nonendocrine tissue and their release by exocytosis is stimulated by nerve impulses from the hypothalamus oxytocin oxytocin stimulates two target tissues during and after parturition childbirth uterine smooth muscle and the muscle cells of the lactating breast during parturition increasing amounts of oxytocin are released by the posterior pituitary into the bloodstream in response to increasing distension of sensory stretch receptors in the uterine cervix by the babys head sensory impulses are generated and travel to the control centre in the hypothalamus stimulating the posterior pituitary to release more oxytocin in turn this stimulates more forceful uterine contractions and greater stretching of the uterine cervix as the babys head is forced further downwards this is an example of a positive feedback mechanism which stops soon after the baby is delivered when distension of the uterine cervix is greatly reduced fig 95 the process of milk ejection also involves a positive feedback mechanism suckling generates sensory impulses that are transmitted from the breast to the hypothalamus the impulses trigger the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary and oxytocin stimulates contraction of the myoepithelial cells around the glandular cells and ducts of the lactating breast to contract ejecting milk suckling also inhibits the release of prolactin inhibiting hormone pih prolonging prolactin secretion and lactation the role of this hormone in males and nonlactating females remains unclear antidiuretic hormone adh or vasopressin the main effect of antidiuretic hormone is to reduce urine output diuresis is the production of a large volume of urine adh increases the permeability to water of the distal convoluted and collecting tubules of the nephrons of the kidneys ch 13 as a result the reabsorption of water from the glomerular filtrate is increased the amount of adh secreted is influenced by the osmotic pressure of the blood circulating to the osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus as the osmotic pressure rises the secretion of adh increases as in for example dehydration and following haemorrhage more water is therefore reabsorbed and the urine output is reduced this means that the body retains more water and the rise in osmotic pressure is reversed conversely when the osmotic pressure of the blood is low for example after a large fluid intake secretion of adh is reduced less water is reabsorbed and more urine is produced fig 911 at high concentrations for example after severe blood loss adh causes smooth muscle contraction especially vasoconstriction in the blood vessels of the skin and abdominal organs this has a pressor effect raising systemic blood pressure the alternative name of this hormone vasopressin reflects this effect,the endocrine system is made up of ductless glands that secrete hormones chemical messengers directly into the bloodstream these hormones are synthesized from amino acids or cholesterolbased lipids and target distant organs to regulate cellular activities like growth metabolism and homeostasis unlike the autonomic nervous system which initiates quick responses hormones drive slower more precise adjustments the system includes the pituitary thyroid parathyroid adrenal glands pancreatic islets pineal gland thymus ovaries and testes the hypothalamus part of the brain indirectly controls many glands especially the pituitary hormones are regulated through negative feedback mechanisms eg gh tsh acth where hormone release negates the initial stimulus and in rare cases through positive feedback amplifying the stimulus eg oxytocin in labor the pituitary gland is divided into anterior and posterior parts anterior pituitary secretes growth hormone gh thyroidstimulating hormone tsh acth prolactin and gonadotropins lh and fsh with various functions in growth metabolism and reproduction posterior pituitary stores and releases oxytocin and adh synthesized in the hypothalamus affecting uterine contractions milk ejection and water retention in kidneys
thyroid gland fig96 the thyroid gland is situated in the neck in front of the larynx and trachea at the level of the 5th 6th and 7th cervical and 1st thoracic vertebrae it is a highly vascular gland that weighs about 25 g and is surrounded by a fibrous capsule it resembles a butterfly in shape consisting of two lobes one on either side of the thyroid cartilage and upper cartilaginous rings of the trachea the lobes are joined by a narrow isthmus lying in front of the trachea the lobes are roughly coneshaped about 5 cm long and 3 cm wide the arterial blood supply to the gland is through the superior and inferior thyroid arteries the superior thyroid artery is a branch of the external carotid artery and the inferior thyroid artery is a branch of the subclavian artery the venous return is by the thyroid veins which drain into the internal jugular veins two parathyroid glands lie against the posterior surface of each lobe and are sometimes embedded in thyroid tissue the recurrent laryngeal nerve passes upwards close to the lobes of the gland and on the right side it lies near the inferior thyroid artery fig 99 the gland is composed of cuboidal epithelium that forms spherical follicles these secrete and store colloid a thick sticky protein material fig 97 between the follicles there are other cells found singly or in small groups parafollicular cells also called ccells which secrete the hormone calcitonin thyroxine and triiodothyronine iodine is essential for the formation of the thyroid gland hormones thyroxine t4 and triiodothyronine t3 the bodys main sources of iodine are seafood vegetables grown in iodinerich soil and iodinated table salt in the diet the thyroid gland selectively takes up iodine from the blood a process called iodine trapping the thyroid hormones are synthesised as large precursor molecules called thyroglobulin the major constituent of colloid the release of t3 and t4 into the blood is regulated by thyroid stimulating hormone tsh from the anterior pituitary secretion of tsh is stimulated by the thyroid releasing hormone trh from the hypothalamus and secretion of trh is stimulated by exercise stress malnutrition low plasma glucose and sleep the level of secretion of tsh depends on the plasma levels of t3 and t4 because these hormones affect the sensitivity of the anterior pituitary to trh increased levels of t3 and t4 decrease tsh secretion and vice versa fig 98 when the supply of iodine is deficient excess tsh is secreted and there is proliferation of thyroid gland cells and enlargement of the gland see goitre p 230 secretion of t3 and t4 begins about the third month of fetal life and is increased at puberty and in women during the reproductive years especially during pregnancy otherwise it remains fairly constant throughout life thyroid hormones enter the target cells and regulate the expression of genes in the nucleus ie they increase or decrease the synthesis of some proteins including enzymes they combine with specific receptor sites and enhance the effects of other hormones eg adrenaline and noradrenaline t3 and t4 affect most cells of the body by increasing the basal metabolic rate and heat production regulating metabolism of carbohydrates proteins and fats t3 and t4 are essential for normal growth and development especially of the skeleton and nervous system most other organs and systems are also influenced by thyroid hormones physiological effects of t3 and t4 on the heart skeletal muscles skin digestive and reproductive systems are more evident when there is underactivity or overactivity of the thyroid gland these changes are listed in table 93 calcitonin this hormone is secreted by the parafollicular or ccells in the thyroid gland it acts on bone and the kidneys to reduce the blood calcium ca2 level when it is raised it reduces the reabsorption of calcium from bones and inhibits reabsorption of calcium by the renal tubules its effect is opposite to that of parathyroid hormone pth parathormone the hormone secreted by the parathyroid glands release of calcitonin is stimulated by an increase in the blood calcium level this hormone is important during childhood when bones undergo considerable changes in size and shape,the thyroid gland a highly vascular butterflyshaped organ in the neck has two lobes connected by an isthmus it produces the hormones thyroxine t4 and triiodothyronine t3 both of which are crucial for regulating the bodys metabolism growth and development the production of t3 and t4 depends on iodine which is obtained from foods like seafood and iodized salt these hormones are regulated by thyroidstimulating hormone tsh released by the anterior pituitary gland and controlled by the hypothalamus low levels of t3 and t4 in the blood stimulate tsh release while high levels inhibit it when iodine intake is low tsh levels increase causing thyroid gland cells to proliferate and potentially resulting in goiter enlargement of the gland in addition to t3 and t4 the thyroid glands parafollicular cells ccells secrete calcitonin this hormone lowers blood calcium levels by decreasing calcium reabsorption from bones and kidneys and counteracts parathyroid hormone pth calcitonin plays an essential role during childhood supporting bone growth and mineralization
parathyroid glands there are four small parathyroid glands two embedded in the posterior surface of each lobe of the thyroid gland fig 99 they are surrounded by fine connective tissue capsules the cells forming the glands are spherical in shape and are arranged in columns with channels containing blood between them function the parathyroid glands secrete parathyroid hormone pth parathormone secretion is regulated by the blood level of calcium when this falls secretion of pth is increased and vice versa the main function of pth is to increase the blood calcium level when it is low this is achieved by indirectly increasing the amount of calcium absorbed from the small intestine and reabsorbed from the renal tubules if these sources provide inadequate supplies then pth stimulates osteoclasts bonedestroying cells and resorption of calcium from bones parathormone and calcitonin from the thyroid gland act in a complementary manner to maintain blood calcium levels within the normal range this is needed for muscle contraction blood clotting nerve impulse transmission adrenal suprarenal glands there are two adrenal glands one situated on the upper pole of each kidney enclosed within the renal fascia see fig 132 p 340 they are about 4 cm long and 3 cm thick the arterial blood supply to the glands is by branches from the abdominal aorta and renal arteries the venous return is by suprarenal veins the right gland drains into the inferior vena cava and the left into the left renal vein the glands are composed of two parts which have different structures and functions the outer part is the cortex and the inner part the medulla the adrenal cortex is essential to life but the medulla is not adrenal cortex the adrenal cortex produces three groups of steroid hormones from cholesterol they are collectively called adrenocorticocoids corticosteroids corticoids they are glucocorticoids mineralocorticoids sex hormones androgens the hormones in each group have different characteristic actions but due to their structural similarity their actions may overlap glucocorticoids cortisol hydrocortisone corticosterone and cortisone are the main glucocorticoids they are essential for life regulating metabolism and responses to stress secretion is stimulated by acth from the anterior pituitary and by stress fig 910 in nonstressful conditions secretion has marked circadian variations the highest level of hormones occurs between 4 am and 8 am and the lowest between midnight and 3 am when the sleeping and waking pattern is changed it takes several days for adjustment of the acthcortisol secretion to take place see p 217 glucocorticoids have widespread effects and these include gluconeogenesis formation of new sugar from for example protein and hyperglycaemia raised blood glucose level lipolysis breakdown of triglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol for energy production stimulating breakdown of protein releasing amino acids which can be used for synthesis of other proteins eg enzymes or for energy atp production p 316 promoting absorption of sodium and water from renal tubules a weak mineralocorticoid effect in pathological and pharmacological quantities glucocorticoids have an antiinflammatory action suppress the immune response suppress the response of tissues to injury delay wound healing mineralocorticoids aldosterone aldosterone is the main mineralocorticoid its functions are associated with the maintenance of water and electrolyte balance in the body it stimulates the reabsorption of sodium na by the renal tubules and excretion of potassium k in the urine sodium reabsorption is also accompanied by retention of water and therefore aldosterone is involved in the regulation of blood volume and blood pressure too the blood potassium level regulates the amount of aldosterone produced by the adrenal cortex when the blood potassium level rises more aldosterone is secreted fig 911 low blood potassium has the opposite effect angiotensin see below also stimulates the release of aldosterone reninangiotensinaldosterone system when renal blood flow is reduced or blood sodium levels fall the enzyme renin is secreted by kidney cells renin converts the plasma protein angiotensinogen produced by the liver to angiotensin 1 angiotensin converting enzyme ace formed in small quantities in the lungs proximal kidney tubules and other tissues converts angiotensin 1 to angiotensin 2 which stimulates secretion of aldosterone fig 911 it also causes vasoconstriction and increases blood pressure sex hormones sex hormones secreted by the adrenal cortex are mainly androgens male sex hormones and the amounts produced are insignificant compared with those secreted by the testes and ovaries in late puberty and adulthood their role is unclear but it is thought that they contribute to the onset of puberty see ch 19 an elevated level in females causes masculinisation control of secretion is poorly understood adrenal medulla the medulla is completely surrounded by the cortex it develops from nervous tissue in the embryo and is part of the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system it is stimulated by its extensive sympathetic nerve supply to produce the hormones adrenaline and nor adrenaline adrenaline and noradrenaline noradrenaline is the postganglionic neurotransmitter of the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system see fig 79 p 146 adrenaline and some noradrenaline are released into the blood from the adrenal medulla during stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system see fig 743 p 171 they are structurally very similar and this explains their similar effects together they potentiate the fight or flight response after initial sympathetic stimulation by increasing heart rate increasing blood pressure diverting blood to essential organs including the heart brain and skeletal muscles by dilating their blood vessels and constricting those of less essential organs such as the skin increasing metabolic rate dilating the pupils adrenaline has a greater effect on the heart and metabolic processes whereas noradrenaline has more influence on blood vessels response to stress when the body is under stress homeostasis is disturbed to restore it and in some cases to maintain life there are immediate and if necessary longerterm responses stressors include exercise fasting fright temperature changes infection disease and emotional disturbances situations the immediate response is sometimes described as preparing for fight or flight this is mediated by the sympathetic part of the autonomic nervous system and the principal effects are shown in figure 912 in the longer term acth from the anterior pituitary stimulates the release of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids from the adrenal cortex and a more prolonged response to stress occurs,the parathyroid glands are four small glands located behind the thyroid which secrete parathyroid hormone pth pth regulates blood calcium levels by increasing absorption from the intestines reabsorption in the kidneys and release from bones it works with calcitonin from the thyroid to maintain calcium balance for muscle contraction nerve transmission and blood clotting the adrenal glands located on top of each kidney consist of the cortex and medulla the cortex produces glucocorticoids eg cortisol to regulate metabolism and stress responses mineralocorticoids eg aldosterone to control water and electrolyte balance and small amounts of sex hormones androgens the medulla produces adrenaline and noradrenaline which enhance the fight or flight response by increasing heart rate blood pressure and metabolic rate during stress aldosterone is part of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system which helps regulate blood pressure by controlling sodium and water reabsorption in the kidneys
pancreatic islets the cells which make up the pancreatic islets islets of langerhans are found in clusters irregularly distributed throughout the substance of the pancreas unlike the exocrine pancreas which produces pancreatic juice there are no ducts leading from the clusters of islet cells pancreatic hormones are secreted directly into the bloodstream and circulate throughout the body there are three main types of cells in the pancreatic islets alpha cells that secrete glucagon m beta cells that secrete insulin m 5 delta cells that secrete somatostatin ghrih p 217 the normal blood glucose level is between 25 and 53 mmollitre 45 to 95 mg100 ml blood glucose levels are controlled mainly by the opposing actions of insulin and glucagon glucagon increases blood glucose levels insulin reduces blood glucose levels insulin the main function of insulin is to lower blood levels of absorbed nutrients when they rise above normal when these nutrients especially glucose are in excess of immediate needs insulin promotes storage by acting on cell membranes and stimulating uptake and use of glucose by muscle and connective tissue cells increasing conversion of glucose to glycogen glycogenesis especially in the liver and skeletal muscles accelerating uptake of amino acids by cells and the synthesis of protein promoting synthesis of fatty acids and storage of fat in adipose tissue lipogenesis decreasing glycogenolysis preventing the breakdown of protein and fat and gluconeogenesis formation of new sugar from eg protein secretion of insulin is stimulated by increased blood glucose and amino acid levels and gastrointestinal hormones eg gastrin secretin and cholecystokinin secretion is decreased by sympathetic stimulation glucagon adrenaline cortisol and somatostatin ghrih secreted by cells of the pancreatic islets insulin is a polypeptide consisting of about 50 amino acids amounts are expressed in international units iu glucagon the effects of glucagon increase blood glucose levels by stimulating eg conversion of glycogen to glucose in the liver and skeletal muscles glycogenolysis gluconeogenesis secretion of glucagon is stimulated by a low blood glucose level and exercise and decreased by somatostatin and insulin somatostatin ghrih the effect of this hormone also produced by the hypothalamus is to inhibit the secretion of both insulin and glucagon pineal gland or body the pineal gland is a small body attached to the roof of the third ventricle and is connected to it by a short stalk containing nerves many of which terminate in the hypothalamus the pineal gland is about 10 mm long is reddish brown in colour and is surrounded by a capsule melatonin this is the hormone secreted by the pineal gland secretion is influenced by the amount of light entering the eye stimulating the optic pathways and levels fluctuate during each 24hour period being highest at night and lowest around midday although its functions are not fully understood it is believed to be associated with coordination of the circadian and diurnal rhythms of many tissues possibly by influencing the hypothalamus inhibition of growth and development of the sex organs before puberty possibly by preventing synthesis or release of gonadotrophins the gland tends to atrophy after puberty and may become calcified in later life thymus gland the location and structure of the thymus gland are described on page 134 thymosin this is the hormone secreted by the thymus gland and is required for the development of tlymphocytes for cellmediated immunity ch 15 local hormones a number of body tissues not normally described as endocrine glands secrete substances that act locally some of these are described below histamine this hormone is synthesised by mast cells in the tissues and basophils in blood it is released as part of the inflammatory process increasing capillary permeability and dilatation it also causes contraction of smooth muscle of the bronchi and alimentary tract and stimulates the secretion of gastric juice serotonin 5hydroxytryptamine 5ht this is present in platelets in the brain and in the intestinal wall it causes intestinal secretion and contraction of smooth muscle and its role in haemostasis blood clotting is outlined in chapter 4 prostaglandins pgs these are lipid substances that act as local hormones and have wideranging physiological effects in the inflammatory response potentiating pain fever regulating blood pressure blood clotting uterine contractions during labour other chemically similar compounds include leukotrienes and thromboxanes they are active substances found in only small amounts as they are rapidly degraded erythropoietin this hormone is synthesised by the kidneys and increases erythropoiesis the rate of red blood cell formation see fig 44 p 63 gastrointestinal hormones several local hormones including gastrin secretin and cholecystokinin cck influence the secretion of digestive juices and their functions are explained in chapter 12,the pancreatic islets islets of langerhans consist of alpha beta and delta cells that produce glucagon insulin and somatostatin respectively glucagon raises blood glucose by stimulating glycogen breakdown while insulin lowers it by promoting glucose uptake and storage as glycogen in muscles and the liver as well as encouraging protein and fat synthesis somatostatin inhibits the secretion of both insulin and glucagon the pineal gland secretes melatonin influenced by light exposure which regulates circadian rhythms and may inhibit sexual maturation until puberty the thymus gland releases thymosin crucial for the maturation of tlymphocytes essential for cellmediated immunity local hormones function near their site of secretion histamine from mast cells increases blood vessel permeability and smooth muscle contraction during inflammation serotonin contributes to blood clotting intestinal movement and mood regulation prostaglandins have various roles including promoting inflammation fever and pain responses regulating blood pressure and aiding uterine contractions during labor erythropoietin primarily from the kidneys stimulates red blood cell production in response to low oxygen while gastrointestinal hormones like gastrin secretin and cholecystokinin regulate digestive enzyme release
disorders of the anterior pituitary endocrine disorders are commonly caused by tumours or autoimmune diseases and their effects are usually the result of hypersecretion overproduction of hormones hyposecretion underproduction of hormones the abnormalities described in this section are those in which there is a general effect but no specific target gland abnormal secretion of stimulating hormones are included with the disorders of their target glands hypersecretion of anterior pituitary hormones gigantism and acromegaly the most common cause is prolonged hypersecretion of growth hormone gh usually by a hormonesecreting pituitary tumour the conditions are only occasionally due to excess growth hormone releasing hormone ghrh secreted by the hypothalamus as the tumour increases in size compression of nearby structures may lead to hyposecretion of other pituitary hormones of both the anterior and posterior lobes hyposecretion of hormonereleasing factors by the hypothalamus damage to the optic nerves causing visual disturbances effects of excess gh these include excessive growth of bones enlargement of internal organs growth of excess connective tissue enlargement of the heart and a rise in blood pressure reduced glucose tolerance and a predisposition to diabetes mellitus gigantism this occurs when there is excess gh while epiphyseal cartilages of long bones are still growing ie during childhood before ossification of bones is complete it is evident mainly in the bones of the limbs and affected individuals may grow to heights of 21 to 24 m although body proportions remain normal fig 913 acromegaly meaning large extremities this occurs when there is excess gh after ossification is complete the bones become abnormally thick due to ossification of periosteum and there is thickening of the soft tissues these changes are most noticeable as coarse facial features an enlarged tongue and excessively large hands and feet fig 914 hyperprolactinaemia this is caused by a hormonesecreting tumour it causes galactorrhoea amenorrhoea and sterility in women and impotence in men hyposecretion of anterior pituitary hormones the number of hormones and the extent of hyposecretion varies panhypopituitarism is absence of all hormones causes of hyposecretion include tumours of the hypothalamus or pituitary trauma usually caused by fractured base of skull or surgery pressure caused by a tumour adjacent to the pituitary gland eg glioma meningioma infection eg meningitis encephalitis syphilis ischaemic necrosis ionising radiation or cytotoxic drugs ischaemic necrosis simmonds disease is hypofunction of the anterior pituitary gland that only rarely affects the posterior lobe the arrangement of the blood supply makes the gland unusually susceptible to a fall in systemic bp ischaemic necrosis of the gland may follow severe hypotensive shock causing deficient stimulation of target glands and hypofunction of all or some of the thyroid adrenal cortex and gonads the outcome depends on the extent of pituitary necrosis and hormone deficiency in severe cases glucocorticoid deficiency may be life threatening or fatal when this condition is associated with severe haemorrhage during or after childbirth it is known as sheehans syndrome and in this situation the other effects are preceded by failure of lactation pituitary dwarfism lorainlevi syndrome this is caused by severe deficiency of gh and possibly of other hormones in childhood the individual is of small stature but is well proportioned and mental development is not affected puberty is delayed and there may be episodes of hypoglycaemia the condition may be due to genetic abnormality or a tumour frohlichs syndrome in this condition there is panhypopituitarism but the main features are associated with deficiency of gh fsh and lh in children the effects are diminished growth lack of sexual development obesity with female distribution of fat and retarded mental development in a similar condition in adults obesity and sterility are the main features it may be the result of a tumour of the anterior pituitary andor the hypothalamus but in most cases the cause is unknown disorders of the posterior pituitary diabetes insipidus this is a relatively rare condition usually caused by hyposecretion of adh due to damage to the hypothalamus by eg trauma tumour encephalitis occasionally it occurs when the renal tubules do not respond to adh water reabsorption by the renal tubules is deficient leading to excretion of excessive amounts of dilute urine often more than 10 litres daily causing dehydration extreme thirst and polydipsia water balance is disturbed unless fluid intake is greatly increased to compensate for excess losses,disorders of the anterior and posterior pituitary glands often result from tumors or autoimmune conditions leading to hypersecretion excess hormone production or hyposecretion insufficient hormone production hypersecretion of gh leads to gigantism in children characterized by excessive height due to continued bone growth and acromegaly in adults where bones thicken after growth plates close resulting in enlarged extremities and facial features hyperprolactinaemia due to excess prolactin can cause lactation amenorrhea and sterility in women and impotence in men hyposecretion conditions include panhypopituitarism where all anterior pituitary hormones are deficient this can result from tumors trauma or ischemic necrosis eg sheehans syndrome after childbirth leading to underfunctioning target glands pituitary dwarfism occurs due to childhood gh deficiency causing proportionate but short stature and frohlichs syndrome results in growth delays lack of sexual development and obesity posterior pituitary disorder diabetes insipidus involves adh deficiency causing extreme thirst and frequent urination potentially leading to dehydration
disorders of the thyroid gland these fall into three main categories abnormal secretion of thyroid hormones t3 and t4 hyperthyroidism hypothyroidism goitre enlargements of the thyroid gland tumours abnormal thyroid function may arise not only from thyroid disease but also from disorders of the pituitary or hypothalamus in addition insufficient dietary iodine causes deficiency in thyroid hormone production the main effects are caused by an abnormally high or low basal metabolic rate abnormal secretion of thyroid hormones hyperthyroidism this syndrome also known as thyrotoxicosis arises as the body tissues are exposed to excessive levels of t3 and t4 the main effects are due to increased basal metabolic rate table 93 in the elderly cardiac failure is another common consequence as the ageing heart works harder to deliver more blood and nutrients to the hyperactive body cells the main causes are graves disease toxic nodular goitre toxic adenoma a benign tumour p 231 graves disease fig 915 sometimes called exophthalmic goitre this accounts for 90 of cases of thyrotoxicosis more women are affected than men and this disorder usually occurs between the ages of 30 and 50 years there is diffuse swelling hyperplasia of the gland with secretion of excess t3 and t4 in addition to the effects of hyperthyroidism there may also be exophthalmos this is an organspecific autoimmune condition where autoantibodies that mimic the action of tsh are produced and stimulate high levels of t3 and t4 secretion exophthalmos protrusion of the eyeballs this is due to the deposition of excess fat and fibrous tissue behind the eyes it is often present in graves disease it may be caused by autoimmunity different from that associated with hyperplasia of the gland effective treatment of thyrotoxicosis does not reduce the exophthalmos in severe cases the eyelids may not completely cover the eyes during blinking and sleep leading to drying of the conjunctiva and predisposing to infection it does not occur in other forms of thyrotoxicosis toxic nodular goitre in this condition one or two nodules of a gland that is already affected by goitre see simple goitre p 230 become active and secrete excess t3 and t4 causing the effects of hyperthyroidism table 93 it is more common in women than men and after middle age as this condition affects an older age group than graves disease arrhythmias and cardiac failure are more common exophthalmos does not occur in this type of hyperthyroidism hypothyroidism this occurs when there is insufficient t3 and t4 secretion causing cretinism in children myxoedema in adults cretinism this condition is endemic in areas remote from the sea where the soil and diet are severely deficient in iodine and there is therefore insufficient iodine for synthesis of t3 and t4 in sporadic cases there is congenital absence of the thyroid gland in both situations retarded physical growth and mental development become evident within a few weeks or months of birth unless treatment begins early in life the individual remains severely mentally retarded has disproportionately short limbs a large protruding tongue coarse dry skin poor abdominal muscle tone and an umbilical hernia fig 916 myxoedema this condition is prevalent in the elderly and is five times more common in females than males deficiency of t3 and t4 in adults results in an abnormally low metabolic rate and other effects shown in table 93 there may be accumulation of polysaccharide substances in the subcutaneous tissues especially of the face fig 917 the commonest causes are autoimmune thyroiditis severe iodine deficiency see goitre iatrogenic eg antithyroid drugs surgical removal of thyroid tissue ionising radiation autoimmune thyroiditis the most common cause of acquired hypothyroidism is hashimotos disease it is more common in women than men similar conditions that are less common include primary myxoedema and focal thyroiditis and like graves disease it is also an organspecific autoimmune condition autoantibodies that react with thyroglobulin and thyroid gland cells develop and prevent synthesis and release of thyroid hormones causing hypothyroidism simple goitre this is enlargement of the thyroid gland without signs of hyperthyroidism secretion of t3 and t4 is reduced and the low levels stimulate secretion of tsh resulting in hyperplasia of the thyroid gland fig 918 sometimes the extra thyroid tissue is able to maintain normal hormone levels but if not hypothyroidism develops causes are persistent iodine deficiency genetic abnormality iatrogenic eg antithyroid drugs surgical removal of excess thyroid tissue the enlarged gland may cause pressure damage to adjacent tissues especially if it lies in an abnormally low position ie behind the sternum the structures most commonly affected are the oesophagus causing dysphagia the trachea causing dyspnoea and the recurrent laryngeal nerve causing hoarseness of voice tumours of the thyroid gland benign tumours single adenomas are fairly common and may become cystic sometimes the adenoma secretes hormones and thyrotoxicosis may develop the tumours have a tendency to become malignant especially in the elderly malignant tumours these are rare and are usually well differentiated but are sometimes anaplastic disorders of the parathyroid glands hyperparathyroidism excess secretion of parathyroid hormone pth usually by benign tumours of a gland causes reabsorption of calcium from bones raising the blood calcium level hypercalcaemia the effects may be formation of renal calculi complicated by pyelonephritis and renal failure polyuria and polydipsia anorexia muscle weakness general fatigue calcification of soft tissue hypoparathyroidism parathyroid hormone pth deficiency causes hypocalcaemia ie an abnormally low level of calcium in the blood this reduces absorption of calcium from the small intestine and reabsorption from bones and glomerular filtrate low blood calcium causes tetany fig 919 psychiatric disturbances paraesthesia grand mal epilepsy development of cataract opacity of the lens and brittle nails 231 the causes of hypoparathyroidism include damage to or removal of the glands during thyroidectomy ionising radiation usually from radioactive iodine used to treat hyperthyroidism development of autoantibodies to pth and parathyroid cells congenital abnormality of the glands tetany this is caused by hypocalcaemia there are very strong painful spasms of skeletal muscles causing characteristic bending inwards of the hands forearms and feet fig 919 in children there may be laryngeal spasm and convulsions hypocalcaemia is associated with hypoparathyroidism deficiency of vitamin d or dietary deficiency of calcium chronic renal failure when there is excretion of excess calcium in the urine alkalosis metabolic due to persistent vomiting ingestion of excess alkali to alleviate gastric disturbances or respiratory due to hyperventilation disorders of the adrenal cortex hypersecretion of glucocorticoids cushings syndrome cortisol is the main glucocorticoid hormone secreted by the adrenal cortex causes of hypersecretion include hormonesecreting adrenal tumours benign or malignant hypersecretion of adrenocorticotrophic hormone acth by the anterior pituitary abnormal secretion of acth by a nonpituitary tumour eg bronchial carcinoma pancreatic tumour carcinoid tumours prolonged therapeutic use of acth or glucocorticoids eg prednisolone in high doses hypersecretion of cortisol has a wide variety of effects but they may not all be present fig 920 they include painful adiposity of the face moon face neck and abdomen excess protein catabolism causing thinning of subcutaneous tissue and muscle wasting especially of the limbs diminished protein synthesis suppression of growth hormone causing arrest of growth in children osteoporosis and kyphosis if vertebral bodies are involved pathological fractures excessive gluconeogenesis with hyperglycaemia and glycosuria atrophy of lymphoid tissue and depressed immune response susceptibility to infection due to reduced febrile response depressed immune response and phagocytosis impaired migration of phagocytes insomnia excitability euphoria psychosis depression hypertension menstrual disturbances formation of renal calculi peptic ulceration hyposecretion of glucocorticoids inadequate secretion of cortisol causes diminished gluconeogenesis low blood glucose muscle weakness and pallor it may be primary ie due to adrenal cortex disease or secondary due to deficiency of acth from the anterior pituitary in primary deficiency there is also hyposecretion of aldosterone see below but in secondary deficiency aldosterone secretion is not usually affected hypersecretion of mineralocorticoids excess aldosterone affects kidney function causing excessive reabsorption of sodium chloride and water causing increased blood volume and hypertension excessive excretion of potassium causing hypokalaemia which leads to cardiac arrhythmia alkalosis syncope and muscle weakness primary aldosteronism conns syndrome this is due to an excessive secretion of mineralocorticoids independent of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system it is usually caused by a tumour affecting only one adrenal gland secondary aldosteronism this is caused by overstimulation of normal glands by the excessively high blood levels of renin and angiotensin that result from low renal perfusion or low blood sodium hyposecretion of mineralocorticoids hypoaldosteronism results in failure of the kidneys to regulate sodium potassium and water excretion leading to blood sodium deficiency hyponatraemia and potassium excess hyperkalaemia dehydration low blood volume and low blood pressure especially if arteriolar constriction is defective due to deficiency of noradrenaline there is usually hyposecretion of other cortical hormones as in addisons disease chronic adrenal cortex insufficiency addisons disease this is due to hyposecretion of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid hormones the most common causes are development of autoantibodies to cortical cells metastatic tumours and infections autoimmune disease of some other glands is associated with addisons disease eg thyrotoxicosis and hypoparathyroidism the most important effects are muscle weakness and wasting gastrointestinal disturbances eg vomiting diarrhoea anorexia increased pigmentation of the skin especially of exposed areas due to excess acth and the related melaninstimulating hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary listlessness and tiredness hypoglycaemia mental confusion menstrual disturbances and loss of body hair in women electrolyte imbalance including hyponatraemia low blood chloride levels and hyperkalaemia chronic dehydration low blood volume and hypotension the adrenal glands have a considerable reserve of tissue and addisons disease is not usually severely debilitating unless more than 90 of cortical tissue is destroyed acute adrenal cortical insufficiency addisonian crisis this is characterised by sudden severe nausea vomiting diarrhoea hypotension electrolyte imbalance and in severe cases circulatory collapse it is precipitated when an individual with chronic adrenal cortex insufficiency is subjected to stress eg an acute infection,thyroid and parathyroid gland disorders impact metabolic and calcium homeostasis in the body in the thyroid hyperthyroidism thyrotoxicosis involves excess secretion of t3 and t4 hormones increasing basal metabolic rate causes include graves disease where autoantibodies mimic tsh leading to symptoms like exophthalmos eye protrusion and toxic nodular goitre usually seen in older adults with possible heart issues conversely hypothyroidism arises from insufficient t3 and t4 secretion leading to low metabolism it causes cretinism in children marked by growth and developmental delays and myxoedema in adults which includes subcutaneous polysaccharide accumulation goitre an enlarged thyroid can stem from iodine deficiency stimulating tsh secretion and gland swelling parathyroid disorders primarily affect calcium levels hyperparathyroidism raises blood calcium due to overactive pth causing bone demineralization while hypoparathyroidism lowers calcium leading to tetany painful muscle spasms adrenal cortex disorders include cushings syndrome excess cortisol which results in obesity immune suppression and skin changes and addisons disease where deficient cortisol and aldosterone cause fatigue hyperpigmentation and electrolyte imbalance addisonian crisis a severe form can lead to circulatory failure during stress
disorders of the adrenal medulla tumours hormonesecreting tumours are the main abnormality the effects of excess adrenaline and noradrenaline include hypertension often associated with arteriosclerosis and cerebral haemorrhage hyperglycaemia and glycosuria excessive sweating and alternate flushing and blanching raised metabolic rate nervousness headache phaeochromocytoma this is a benign tumour occurring in one or both glands the secretion of hormones may be at a steady high level or in intermittent bursts neuroblastoma this is a malignant tumour occurring in infants and children under 15 years of age tumours that develop early tend to be highly malignant but in this condition there may be spontaneous regression disorders of the pancreatic islets diabetes mellitus this is due to deficiency or absence of insulin or rarely to impairment of insulin activity insulin resistance causing varying degrees of disruption of carbohydrate and fat metabolism type i insulindependent diabetes mellitus iddm this occurs mainly in children and young adults and the onset is usually sudden the deficiency or absence of insulin is due to the destruction of islet cells the causes are unknown but there is a familial tendency suggesting genetic involvement in many cases an autoimmune reaction has occurred in which autoantibodies to islet cells are present antibodies to viruses are present in some cases and these may destroy the 3islet cells directly or by an autoimmune mechanism type ii noninsulindependent diabetes mellitus niddm this is the most common form of diabetes accounting for about 90 of cases most patients are obese and it tends to develop in women over 75 years and men over 65 years the cause is unknown insulin secretion may be below or above normal deficiency of glucose inside body cells may occur when there is hyperglycaemia and a high insulin level this may be due to changes in cell membranes which block the insulinassisted movement of glucose into cells insulin resistance secondary diabetes this may develop as a complication of acute and chronic pancreatitis some drugs eg corticosteroids phenytoin thiazide diuretics secondary to other hormonal disturbances involving hypersecretion of eg growth hormone thyroid hormones cortisol adrenaline pregnancy gestational diabetes gestational diabetes this develops during pregnancy and usually disappears after delivery however diabetes often recurs in later life raised blood glucose levels during pregnancy predispose to the birth of excessively large babies and also to stillbirths and deaths shortly after birth effects of diabetes mellitus raised blood glucose level after the intake of a carbohydrate meal the blood glucose level remains high because glucose uptake and use by body cells is defective conversion of glucose to glycogen in the liver and muscles is diminished there is gluconeogenesis from protein in response to deficiency of intracellular glucose glycosuria and polyuria the concentration of glucose in the glomerular filtrate is the same as in the blood and although diabetes raises the renal threshold for glucose it is not all reabsorbed by the tubules p 344 the remaining glucose in the filtrate raises the osmotic pressure water reabsorption is reduced and the volume of urine produced is increased this causes electrolyte imbalance and excretion of urine of high specific gravity polyuria leads to hypovolaemia extreme thirst and polydipsia weight loss in diabetes cells fail to metabolise glucose in the normal manner resulting in weight loss due to gluconeogenesis from amino acids and body protein causing tissue wasting tissue breakdown and further increase in blood glucose catabolism of body fat releasing some of its energy and excess production of ketoacids ketoacidosis this is due to the accumulation of the intermediate metabolite acetyl coenzyme a which cannot enter the citric acid cycle without oxaloacetic acid see fig 1248 p 318 in diabetes the amount of available oxaloacetic acid is reduced because glucose metabolism is reduced as a result excess acetyl coenzyme a is converted to ketones which are acidic when these accumulate in the blood the ph drops causing ketoacidosis ketones are excreted in the urine ketonuria and by the lungs the consequences are hyperventilation and the excretion of excess bicarbonate acidification of urine and high filtrate osmotic pressure which leads to excessive loss of water polyuria ammonia sodium and potassium coma due to a combination of low blood ph acidosis high plasma osmotic pressure and electrolyte imbalance acute complications of diabetes mellitus diabetic ketoacidosis diabetic coma hyperglycaemic coma this mainly affects insulindependent diabetics ketoacidosis develops owing to increased insulin requirement or increased resistance to insulin due to some added stress such as pregnancy microbial infection infarction cerebrovascular accident the inadequate supply of insulin may also be due to failure by the patient to administer the prescribed dose or inadequate adjustment of the prescribed dose to meet the patients increased needs in some cases severe and dangerous ketoacidosis may occur without loss of consciousness the factors that predispose to the development of hyperglycaemic coma in either type of diabetes include hypovolaemia with severe dehydration due to persistent polyuria high blood osmotic pressure due to excess blood glucose leading to electrolyte imbalance acidosis due to accumulation of ketoacids hypoglycaemic coma this occurs in insulindependent diabetics when the insulin administered is in excess of that needed to balance the food intake and expenditure of energy because neurones are more dependent on glucose for their energy needs than are other cells glucose deprivation causes disturbed neural function leading to coma and if prolonged irreversible damage hypoglycaemia may be the result of accidental overdose of insulin delay in eating after insulin administration gastrointestinal disturbances in which carbohydrate absorption is diminished eg vomiting diarrhoea increased metabolic rate in eg unexpected exercise acute febrile illness an insulinsecreting tumour especially if it produces irregular bursts of secretion common signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia include drowsiness confusion speech difficulty sweating trembling and anxiety longterm complications of diabetes mellitus cardiovascular disturbances changes in blood vessels occur even when the disease is well controlled by insulin andor diet diabetic macroangiopathy the most common lesions are atheroma and calcification of the tunica media of the large muscular arteries in insulindependent diabetics these changes may occur at a relatively early age the most common sequelae are serious and often fatal peripheral vascular disease myocardial infarction cerebral ischaemia and infarction diabetic microangiopathy there is thickening of the epithelial basement membrane of arterioles capillaries and sometimes of venules these changes may lead to peripheral vascular disease progressing to gangrene retinopathy in which microaneurysms and small haemorrhages cause numerous small necrotic points in the retina leading to loss of sight glomerulosclerosis leading to nephrotic syndrome and renal failure peripheral neuropathy especially when myelination is defective infection diabetics are highly susceptible to infection especially by bacteria and fungi possibly because phagocyte activity is depressed by insufficient intracellular glucose infection may cause complications in areas affected by peripheral neuropathy and changes in blood vessels eg in the feet when sensation and blood supply are impaired boils and carbuncles vaginal candidiasis thrush pyelonephritis renal failure this is due to changes affecting the walls of small blood vessels and infection and is a common cause of death in diabetics see diabetic kidney p 352,disorders of the adrenal medulla mainly involve hormonesecreting tumors excess adrenaline and noradrenaline can cause symptoms like hypertension hyperglycemia glycosuria excessive sweating and nervousness phaeochromocytoma is a benign tumor in the adrenal medulla that can secrete hormones in high amounts either consistently or intermittently neuroblastoma a malignant tumor affecting children can show spontaneous regression pancreatic islet disorders include diabetes mellitus characterized by insufficient insulin production or action disrupting carbohydrate and fat metabolism type i diabetes common in young people results from autoimmune destruction of insulinproducing cells type ii diabetes more prevalent in older adults is linked to insulin resistance often associated with obesity secondary diabetes may result from other medical conditions or medications gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy and can lead to complications such as large babies or stillbirths diabetes mellitus can cause high blood glucose polyuria weight loss ketoacidosis and coma longterm complications include cardiovascular issues retinopathy neuropathy and susceptibility to infections cardiovascular diseases kidney failure and gangrene are common in poorly managed diabetes
the respiratory system the cells of the body need energy for their chemical activity that maintains homeostasis most of this energy is derived from chemical reactions which can only take place in the presence of oxygen o2 the main waste product of these reactions is carbon dioxide co2 the respiratory system provides the route by which the supply of oxygen present in the atmospheric air gains entry to the body and it provides the route of excretion of carbon dioxide the condition of the atmospheric air entering the body varies considerably according to the external environment eg it may be dry cold and contain dust particles or it may be moist and hot as the air breathed in moves through the air passages to reach the lungs it is warmed or cooled to body temperature moistened to become saturated with water vapour and cleaned as particles of dust stick to the mucus which coats the lining membrane blood provides the transport system for these gases between the lungs and the cells of the body exchange of gases between the blood and the lungs is called external respiration and that between the blood and the cells internal respiration the organs of the respiratory system are nose pharynx larynx trachea two bronchi one bronchus to each lung bronchioles and smaller air passages two lungs and their coverings the pleura muscles of respiration the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm a general view of the organs of the respiratory system is given in figure 101 nose and nasal cavity position and structure the nasal cavity is the first of the respiratory organs and consists of a large irregular cavity divided into two equal passages by a septum the posterior bony part of the septum is formed by the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone and the vomer anteriorly it consists of hyaline cartilage fig 102 the roof is formed by the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone and the sphenoid bone frontal bone and nasal bones the floor is formed by the roof of the mouth and consists of the hard palate in front and the soft palate behind the hard palate is composed of the maxilla and palatine bones and the soft palate consists of involuntary muscle the medial wall is formed by the septum the lateral walls are formed by the maxilla the ethmoid bone and the inferior conchae fig 103 the posterior wall is formed by the posterior wall of the pharynx lining of the nose the nose is lined with very vascular ciliated columnar epithelium ciliated mucous membrane which contains mucussecreting goblet cells p 43 at the anterior nares this blends with the skin and posteriorly it extends into the nasal part of the pharynx openings into the nasal cavity the anterior nares or nostrils are the openings from the exterior into the nasal cavity hairs are present in this area the posterior nares are the openings from the nasal cavity into the pharynx the paranasal sinuses are cavities in the bones of the face and the cranium which contain air there are tiny openings between the paranasal sinuses and the nasal cavity they are lined with mucous membrane continuous with that of the nasal cavity the main sinuses are maxillary sinuses in the lateral walls frontal and sphenoidal sinuses in the roof fig 103 ethmoidal sinuses in the upper part of the lateral walls fig 103 the sinuses function in speech and also serve to lighten the skull the nasolacrimal ducts extend from the lateral walls of the nose to the conjunctival sacs of the eye p 205 they drain tears from the eyes respiratory function of the nose the nose is the first of the respiratory passages through which the inspired air passes the function of the nose is to begin the process by which the air is warmed moistened and filtered the projecting conchae figs 103 and 104 increase the surface area and cause turbulence spreading inspired air over the whole nasal surface the large surface area maximises warming humidification and filtering warming this is due to the immense vascularity of the mucosa this explains the large blood loss when a nosebleed epistaxis occurs filtering and cleaning of air this occurs as hairs at the anterior nares trap larger particles smaller particles such as dust and microbes settle and adhere to the mucus mucus protects the underlying epithelium from irritation and prevents drying synchronous beating of the cilia wafts the mucus towards the throat where it is swallowed or expectorated humidification this occurs as air travels over the moist mucosa and becomes saturated with water vapour irritation of the nasal mucosa results in sneezing a reflex action that forcibly expels an irritant olfactory function of the nose the nose is the organ of the sense of smell there are nerve endings that detect smell located in the roof of the nose in the area of the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bones and the superior conchae these nerve endings are stimulated by chemical substances given off by odorous materials the resultant nerve impulses are conveyed by the olfactory nerves to the brain where the sensation of smell is perceived p 206 pharynx position,the respiratory system provides oxygen o to body cells for energy production and removes carbon dioxide co a metabolic waste air enters through the nose and nasal cavity where it undergoes initial warming humidification and filtration the nasal cavity lined with vascular ciliated mucous membranes traps and removes particles its rich blood supply helps warm the air to body temperature cilia on the epithelial cells move mucusbound debris to the throat for swallowing or expulsion the air then moves down the respiratory tract passing through structures including the pharynx larynx trachea bronchi and bronchioles before reaching the lungs where gas exchange occurs external respiration refers to gas exchange between the blood and the lungs while internal respiration describes gas transfer between blood and body cells the nasal cavity also plays a sensory role with olfactory receptors which detect chemical signals from odorous substances and transmit them to the brain allowing for the sense of smell the coordinated functions of these structures ensure that air reaching the lungs is clean warm and moist protecting delicate lung tissues and maintaining efficient respiratory function
larynx position the larynx or voice box extends from the root of the tongue and the hyoid bone to the trachea it lies in front of the laryngopharynx at the level of the 3rd 4th 5th and 6th cervical vertebrae until puberty there is little difference in the size of the larynx between the sexes thereafter it grows larger in the male which explains the prominence of the adams apple and the generally deeper voice structures associated with the larynx superiorly the hyoid bone and the root of the tongue inferiorily it is continuous with the trachea anteriorly the muscles attached to the hyoid bone and the muscles of the neck posteriorly the laryngopharynx and 3rd to 6th cervical vertebrae laterally the lobes of the thyroid gland structure cartilages the larynx is composed of several irregularly shaped cartilages attached to each other by ligaments and membranes the main cartilages are 1 thyroid cartilage 1 cricoid cartilage 2 arytenoid cartilages 1 epiglottis hyaline cartilage elastic fibrocartilage the thyroid cartilage figs 106 and 107 this is the most prominent and consists of two flat pieces of hyaline cartilage or laminae fused anteriorly forming the laryngeal prominence adams apple immediately above the laryngeal prominence the laminae are separated forming a vshaped notch known as the thyroid notch the thyroid cartilage is incomplete posteriorly and the posterior border of each lamina is extended to form two processes called the superior and inferior cornu the upper part of the thyroid cartilage is lined with stratified squamous epithelium like the larynx and the lower part with ciliated columnar epithelium like the trachea there are many muscles attached to its outer surface the cricoid cartilage fig 105 this lies below the thyroid cartilage and is also composed of hyaline cartilage it is shaped like a signet ring completely encircling the larynx with the narrow part anteriorly and the broad part posteriorly the broad posterior part articulates with the arytenoid cartilages above and with the inferior cornu of the thyroid cartilage below it is lined with ciliated columnar epithelium and there are muscles and ligaments attached to its outer surface fig 107 the lower border of the cricoid cartilage marks the end of the upper respiratory tract the arytenoid cartilages these are two roughly pyramidshaped hyaline cartilages situated on top of the broad part of the cricoid cartilage forming part of the posterior wall of the larynx they give attachment to the vocal cords and to muscles and are lined with ciliated columnar epithelium the epiglottis this is a leafshaped fibroelastic cartilage attached to the inner surface of the anterior wall of the thyroid cartilage immediately below the thyroid notch it rises obliquely upwards behind the tongue and the body of the hyoid bone it is covered with stratified squamous epithelium if the larynx is likened to a box then the epiglottis acts as the lid it closes off the larynx during swallowing protecting the lungs from accidental inhalation of foreign objects ligaments and membranes there are several ligaments that attach the cartilages to each other and to the hyoid bone figs 106107 and 108 blood and nerve supply blood is supplied to the larynx by the superior and inferior laryngeal arteries and drained by the thyroid veins which join the internal jugular vein the parasympathetic nerve supply is from the superior laryngeal and recurrent laryngeal nerves which are branches of the vagus nerves and the sympathetic nerves are from the superior cervical ganglia one on each side these provide the motor nerve supply to the muscles of the larynx and sensory fibres to the lining membrane interior of the larynx the vocal cords are two pale folds of mucous membrane with cordlike free edges which extend from the inner wall of the thyroid prominence anteriorly to the arytenoid cartilages posteriorly fig 108 when the muscles controlling the vocal cords are relaxed the vocal cords open and the passageway for air coming up through the larynx is clear the vocal cords are said to be abducted fig 109a the pitch of the sound produced by vibrating the vocal cords in this the vocal cords are stretched to this extent and are vibrated by air passing through from the lungs the sound produced is high pitched the pitch of the voice is therefore determined by the tension applied to the vocal cords by the appropriate sets of muscles when not in use the vocal cords are adducted functions production of sound sound has the properties of pitch volume and resonance pitch of the voice depends upon the length and tightness of the cords at puberty the male vocal cords begin to grow longer hence the lower pitch of the adult male voice volume of the voice depends upon the force with which the cords vibrate the greater the force of expired air the more the cords vibrate and the louder the sound emitted resonance or tone is dependent upon the shape of the mouth the position of the tongue and the lips the facial muscles and the air in the paranasal sinuses speech this occurs during expiration when the sounds produced by the vocal cords are manipulated by the tongue cheeks and lips protection of the lower respiratory tract during swallowing deglutition the larynx moves upwards occluding the opening into it from the pharynx and theposition is low when the muscles controlling the vocal cords contract the vocal cords are stretched out tightly across the larynx fig 109b they are said to be adducted when hinged epiglottis closes over the larynx this ensures that food passes into the oesophagus and not into the lower respiratory passages p 295 passageway for air this is between the pharynx and trachea humidifying filtering and warming these continue as inspired air travels through the larynx trachea position the trachea or windpipe is a continuation of the larynx and extends downwards to about the level of the 5th thoracic vertebra where it divides bifurcates at the carina into the right and left bronchi one bronchus going to each lung it is approximately 10 to 11 cm long and lies mainly in the median plane in front of the oesophagus fig 1010 structures associated with the trachea fig 1011 superiorly inferiorly anteriorly posteriorly laterally structure the larynx the right and left bronchi upper part the isthmus of the thyroid gland lower part the arch of the aorta and the sternum the oesophagus separates the trachea from the vertebral column the lungs and the lobes of the thyroid gland structure the trachea is composed of from 16 to 20 incomplete cshaped rings of hyaline cartilages lying one above the other the cartilages are incomplete posteriorly connective tissue and involuntary muscle join the cartilages and form the posterior wall where they are incomplete the soft tissue posterior wall is in contact with the oesophagus fig 1010 there are three layers of tissue which clothe the cartilages of the trachea the outer layer this consists of fibrous and elastic tissue and encloses the cartilages the middle layer this consists of cartilages and bands of smooth muscle that wind round the trachea in a helical arrangement there is some areolar tissue containing blood and lymph vessels and autonomic nerves the inner lining this consists of ciliated columnar epithelium containing mucussecreting goblet cells blood and nerve supply lymph drainage the arterial blood supply this is mainly by the inferior thyroid and bronchial arteries and the venous return is by the inferior thyroid veins into the brachiocephalic veins the nerve supply this is by parasympathetic and sympathetic fibres parasympathetic supply is by the recurrent laryngeal nerves and other branches of the vagi sympathetic supply is by nerves from the sympathetic ganglia lymph lymph from the respiratory passages passes through lymph nodes situated round the trachea and in the carina the area where it divides into two bronchi functions support and patency the arrangement of cartilage and elastic tissue prevents kinking and obstruction of the airway as the head and neck move the absence of cartilage posteriorly allows the trachea to dilate and constrict in response to nerve stimulation and for indentation as the oesophagus distends during swallowing the cartilages prevent collapse of the tube when the internal pressure is less than intrathoracic pressure ie at the end of forced expiration mucociliary escalator this is the synchronous and regular beating of the cilia of the mucous membrane lining that wafts mucus with adherent particles upwards towards the larynx where it is swallowed or expectorated fig 1012 cough reflex nerve endings in the larynx trachea and bronchi are sensitive to irritation that generates nerve impulses which are conducted by the vagus nerves to the respiratory centre in the brain stem p 256 the reflex motor response is deep inspiration followed by closure of the glottis the abdominal and respiratory muscles then contract and suddenly the air is released under pressure expelling mucus andor foreign material from the mouth warming humidifying and filtering of air these continue as in the nose although air is normally saturated and at body temperature when it reaches the trachea,the larynx or voice box is located between the root of the tongue and the trachea positioned at the 3rd to 6th cervical vertebrae this structure larger in males after puberty is composed of several cartilage types such as the thyroid forming the adams apple cricoid arytenoid and the epiglottis which acts as a lid protecting the airway during swallowing the vocal cords within the larynx are mucous membrane folds that vibrate to create sound with pitch influenced by cord tension and volume by airflow force the larynx also humidifies filters and warms inhaled air and contributes to voice resonance through its shape and muscle coordination the trachea or windpipe extends from the larynx to the 5th thoracic vertebra where it divides into the bronchi it is supported by cshaped hyaline cartilage rings that prevent collapse especially during forced expiration its inner lining of ciliated epithelium aids in filtering and moving mucus upward in a process known as the mucociliary escalator the trachea also triggers the cough reflex to expel irritants together the larynx and trachea form critical parts of the respiratory system ensuring efficient air passage sound production and airway protection
bronchi and smaller air passages the two primary bronchi are formed when the trachea divides ie about the level of the 5th thoracic vertebra fig 1013 the right bronchus this is wider shorter and more vertical than the left bronchus and is therefore the more likely of the two to become obstructed by an inhaled foreign body it is approximately 25 cm long after entering the right lung at the hilum it divides into three branches one to each lobe each branch then subdivides into numerous smaller branches the left bronchus this is about 5 cm long and is narrower than the right after entering the lung at the hilum it divides into two branches one to each lobe each branch then subdivides into progressively smaller tubes within the lung substance bronchi and bronchioles structure the bronchi are composed of the same tissues as the trachea they are lined with ciliated columnar epithelium the bronchi progressively subdivide into bronchioles fig 1013 terminal bronchioles respiratory bronchioles alveolar ducts and finally alveoli towards the distal end of the bronchi the cartilages become irregular in shape and are absent at bronchiolar level in the absence of cartilage the smooth muscle in the walls of the bronchioles becomes thicker and is responsive to autonomic nerve stimulation and irritation ciliated columnar mucous membrane changes gradually to nonciliated cuboidalshaped cells in the distal bronchioles blood and nerve supply lymph drainage the arterial blood supply the supply to the walls of the bronchi and smaller air passages is through branches of the right and left bronchial arteries and the venous return is mainly through the bronchial veins on the right side they empty into the azygos vein and on the left into the superior intercostal vein see figs 542 and 543 p 103 the nerve supply this is by parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves the vagus nerves parasympathetic stimulate contraction of smooth muscle in the bronchial tree causing bronchoconstriction and sympathetic stimulation causes bronchodilatation ch 7 the lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes lymph is drained from the walls of the air passages in a network of lymph vessels it passes through lymph nodes situated around the trachea and bronchial tree then into the thoracic duct on the left side and right lymphatic duct on the other functions of air passages not involved in gaseous exchange control of air entry the diameter of the respiratory passages may be altered by contraction or relaxation of the involuntary muscles in their walls thus regulating the volume of air entering the lungs these changes are controlled by the autonomic nerve supply parasympathetic stimulation causes constriction and sympathetic stimulation causes dilatation p 173 the following functions continue as in the upper airways warming and humidifying support and patency removal of particulate matter cough reflex respiratory bronchioles and alveoli structure lobules are the blind ends of the respiratory tract distal to the terminal bronchioles consisting of respiratory bronchioles alveolar ducts and alveoli tiny air sacs fig 1013 it is in these structures that the process of gas exchange occurs the walls gradually become thinner until muscle and connective tissue fade out leaving a single layer of simple squamous epithelial cells in the alveolar ducts and alveoli these distal respiratory passages are supported by a loose network of elastic connective tissue in which macrophages fibroblasts nerves and blood and lymph vessels are embedded the alveoli are surrounded by a network of capillaries the exchange of gases during respiration takes place across two membranes the alveolar and capillary membranes interspersed between the squamous cells are other cells that secrete surfactant a phospholipid fluid which prevents the alveoli from drying out in addition surfactant reduces surface tension and prevents alveolar walls collapsing during expiration secretion of surfactant into the distal air passages and alveoli begins about the 35th week of fetal life its presence in newborn babies facilitates expansion of the lungs and the establishment of respiration it may not be present in sufficient amounts in the immature lungs of premature babies causing difficulty in establishing respiration functions of respiratory bronchioles and alveoli external respiration see p 255 defence against microbes at this level ciliated epithelium goblet cells and mucus are no longer present defence relies on protective cells present within the lung tissue these include lymphocytes and plasma cells which produce antibodies in the presence of antigens and macrophages and polymorphonuclear lymphocytes which are phagocytic these cells are most active in the distal air passages where ciliated epithelium has been replaced by flattened cells warming and humidifying these continue as in the upper airways inhalation of dry or inadequately humidified air over a period of time causes irritation of the mucosa and facilitates the establishment of pathogenic microbes lungs position and associated structures fig 1014 there are two lungs one lying on each side of the midline in the thoracic cavity they are coneshaped and are described as having an apex a base costal surface and medial surface the apex this is rounded and rises into the root of the neck about 25 mm 1 inch above the level of the middle third of the clavicle the structures associated with it are the first rib and the blood vessels and nerves in the root of the neck the base this is concave and semilunar in shape and is closely associated with the thoracic surface of the diaphragm the costal surface this surface is convex and is closely associated with the costal cartilages the ribs and the intercostal muscles the medial surface this surface is concave and has a roughly triangularshaped area called the hilum at the level of the 5th 6th and 7th thoracic vertebrae structures which form the root of the lung enter and leave at the hilum these include the primary bronchus the pulmonary artery supplying the lung and the two pulmonary veins draining it the bronchial artery and veins and the lymphatic and nerve supply fig 1015 the area between the lungs is the mediastinum it is occupied by the heart great vessels trachea right and left bronchi oesophagus lymph nodes lymph vessels and nerves organisation of the lungs the right lung is divided into three distinct lobes superior middle and inferior the left lung is smaller as the heart is situated left of the midline it is divided into only two lobes superior and inferior pleura and pleural cavity the pleura consists of a closed sac of serous membrane one for each lung which contains a small amount of serous fluid the lung is invaginated into this sac so that it forms two layers one adheres to the lung and the other to the wall of the thoracic cavity figs 101 and 1016 the visceral pleura this is adherent to the lung covering each lobe and passing into the fissures which separate them the parietal pleura this is adherent to the inside of the chest wall and the thoracic surface of the diaphragm it remains detached from the adjacent structures in the mediastinum and is continuous with the visceral pleura round the edges of the hilum the pleural cavity this is only a potential space in health the two layers of pleura are separated by only a thin film of serous fluid which allows them to glide over each other preventing friction between them during breathing the serous fluid is secreted by the epithelial cells of the membrane the two layers of pleura with serous fluid between them behave in the same way as two pieces of glass separated by a thin film of water they glide over each other easily but can be pulled apart only with difficulty because of the surface tension between the membranes and the fluid if either layer of pleura is punctured the underlying lung collapses due to its inherent property of elastic recoil interior of the lungs the lungs are composed of the bronchi and smaller air passages alveoli connective tissue blood vessels lymph vessels and nerves the left lung is divided into two lobes and the right into three fig 1015 each lobe is made up of a large number of lobules pulmonary blood supply fig 1017 the pulmonary artery divides into two one branch conveying deoxygenated blood to each lung within the lungs each pulmonary artery divides into many branches which eventually end in a dense capillary network around the walls of the alveoli fig 1018 the walls of the alveoli and those of the capillaries each consist of only one layer of flattened epithelial cells the exchange of gases between air in the alveoli and blood in the capillaries takes place across these two very fine membranes the pulmonary capillaries join up eventually becoming two pulmonary veins in each lung they leave the lungs at the hilum and convey oxygenated blood to the left atrium of the heart the innumerable blood capillaries and blood vessels in the lungs are supported by connective tissue the blood supply to the respiratory passages lymphatic drainage and nerve supply has already been described p 248,the bronchi are air passages formed when the trachea divides into the right and left primary bronchi at the level of the 5th thoracic vertebra the right bronchus is wider shorter and more vertical making it more prone to obstruction while the left bronchus is narrower and longer each bronchus divides within the lungs branching into smaller bronchioles which then terminate in alveolar ducts and alveoli where gas exchange occurs the bronchi and bronchioles are lined with ciliated columnar epithelium that transitions to nonciliated cells in the distal bronchioles the walls contain smooth muscle which can contract or relax controlling air flow in response to autonomic nerve signals parasympathetic causing constriction and sympathetic causing dilation the lungs are divided into lobes three on the right and two on the left they are enclosed by pleura a doublelayered membrane with a lubricating fluid that minimizes friction each lung lobe is further divided into lobules and each alveolus is surrounded by capillaries facilitating gas exchange surfactant secreted in the alveoli prevents collapse and maintains surface tension blood supply involves bronchial arteries for lung tissues and pulmonary arteries for gas exchange
respiration inflation and deflation of the lungs occurring with each breath ensures that regular exchange of gases takes place between the alveoli and the external air muscles of respiration the expansion of the chest during inspiration occurs as a result of muscular activity partly voluntary and partly involuntary the main muscles of respiration in normal quiet breathing are the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm during difficult or deep breathing they are assisted by the muscles of the neck shoulders and abdomen intercostal muscles there are 11 pairs of intercostal muscles that occupy the spaces between the 12 pairs of ribs they are arranged in two layers the external and internal intercostal muscles fig 1019 the external intercostal muscle fibres these extend in a downwards and forwards direction from the lower border of the rib above to the upper border of the rib below the internal intercostal muscle fibres these extend in a downwards and backwards direction from the lower border of the rib above to the upper border of the rib below crossing the external intercostal muscle fibres at right angles the first rib is fixed therefore when the intercostal muscles contract they pull all the other ribs towards the first rib because of the shape of the ribs they move outwards when pulled upwards in this way the thoracic cavity is enlarged anteroposteriorly and laterally the intercostal muscles are stimulated to contract by the intercostal nerves diaphragm the diaphragm is a domeshaped structure separating the thoracic and abdominal cavities it forms the floor of the thoracic cavity and the roof of the abdominal cavity and consists of a central tendon from which muscle fibres radiate to be attached to the lower ribs and sternum and to the vertebral column by two crura when the muscle of the diaphragm is relaxed the central tendon is at the level of the 8th thoracic vertebra fig 1020 when it contracts its muscle fibres shorten and the central tendon is pulled downwards to the level of the 9th thoracic vertebra enlarging the thoracic cavity in length this decreases pressure in the thoracic cavity and increases it in the abdominal and pelvic cavities the diaphragm is supplied by the phrenic nerves the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm contract simultaneously ensuring the enlargement of the thoracic cavity in all directions that is from back to front side to side and top to bottom fig 1021 cycle of respiration this occurs 12 to 15 times per minute and consists of three phases inspiration expiration pause as described previously the visceral pleura is adherent to the lungs and the parietal pleura to the inner wall of the thorax and to the diaphragm between them there is a thin film of serous fluid p 251 inspiration when the capacity of the thoracic cavity is increased by simultaneous contraction of the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm the parietal pleura moves with the walls of the thorax and the diaphragm this reduces the pressure in the pleural cavity to a level considerably lower than atmospheric pressure the visceral pleura follows the parietal pleura pulling the lung with it this stretches the lungs and the pressure within the alveoli and in the air passages falls drawing air into the lungs in an attempt to equalise the atmospheric and alveolar air pressures the process of inspiration is active as it requires expenditure of energy for muscle contraction the negative pressure created in the thoracic cavity aids venous return to the heart and is known as the respiratory pump expiration relaxation of the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm results in downward and inward movement of the rib cage fig 1021 and elastic recoil of the lungs as this occurs pressure inside the lungs exceeds that in the atmosphere and therefore air is expelled from the respiratory tract the lungs still contain some air and are prevented from complete collapse by the intact pleura this process is passive as it does not require the expenditure of energy after expiration there is a pause before the next cycle begins physiological variables affecting respiration elasticity elasticity is the term used to describe the ability of the lung to return to its normal shape after each breath loss of elasticity of the connective tissue in the lungs necessitates forced expiration and increased effort on inspiration compliance this is a measure of the distensibility of the lungs ie the effort required to inflate the alveoli when compliance is low the effort needed to inflate the lungs is greater than normal eg in some diseases where elasticity is reduced or when insufficient surfactant is present it should be noted that compliance and elasticity are opposing forces airflow resistance when this is increased eg in bronchoconstriction more respiratory effort is required to inflate the lungs lung volumes and capacities fig1022 in normal quiet breathing there are about 15 complete respiratory cycles per minute the lungs and the air passages are never empty and as the exchange of gases takes place only across the walls of the alveolar ducts and alveoli the remaining capacity of the respiratory passages is called the anatomical dead space about 150 ml tidal volume tv this is the amount of air which passes into and out of the lungs during each cycle of quiet breathing about 500 ml inspiratory reserve volume irv this is the extra volume of air that can be inhaled into the lungs during maximal inspiration inspiratory capacity 1c this is the amount of air that can be inspired with maximum effort it consists of the tidal volume 500 ml plus the inspiratory reserve volume functional residual capacity frc this is the amount of air remaining in the air passages and alveoli at the end of quiet expiration tidal air mixes with this air causing relatively small changes in the composition of alveolar air as blood flows continuously through the pulmonary capillaries this means that the interchange of gases is not interrupted between breaths preventing marked changes in the concentration of blood gases the functional residual volume also prevents collapse of the alveoli on expiration expiratory reserve volume erv this is the largest volume of air which can be expelled from the lungs during maximal expiration residual volume rv this cannot be directly measured but is the volume of air remaining in the lungs after forced expiration vital capacity vc this is the maximum volume of air which can be moved into and out of the lungs vc tidal volume irv erv alveolar ventilation this is the volume of air that moves into and out of the alveoli per minute it is equal to the tidal volume minus the anatomical dead space multiplied by the respiratory rate lung function tests are carried out to determine respiratory function and are based on the parameters outlined above results of these tests can help in diagnosis and monitoring of respiratory disorders composition of air atmospheric pressure at sea level is 1013 kilopascals kpa or 760 mmhg with the increase in height above sea level atmospheric pressure is progressively reduced and at 5500 m about twothirds the height of mount everest 8850 m it is about half that at sea level under water pressure increases by approximately 1 atmosphere per 10 m below sea level air is a mixture of gases nitrogen oxygen carbon dioxide water vapour and small quantities of inert gases the percentage of each is listed in table 101 each gas in the mixture exerts a part of the total pressure proportional to its concentration ie the partial pressure table 102 this is denoted as eg po2 pco2 alveolar air the composition of alveolar air remains fairly constant and is different from atmospheric air it is saturated with water vapour and contains more carbon dioxide and less oxygen saturation with water vapour provides 63 kpa 47 mmhg thus reducing the partial pressure of all the other gases present gaseous exchange between the alveoli and the bloodstream external respiration is a continuous process as the alveoli are never empty so it is independent of the respiratory cycle during each inspiration only some of the alveolar gases are exchanged expired air this is a mixture of alveolar air and atmospheric air in the dead space its composition is shown in table 101,respiration ensures continuous gas exchange in the lungs primarily between alveoli and external air this process relies on the muscles of respirationthe diaphragm and intercostal muscles the diaphragm is a domeshaped muscle that separates the thoracic and abdominal cavities when it contracts it moves downward increasing thoracic volume and reducing pressure this negative pressure draws air into the lungs aided by the intercostal muscles that lift the rib cage outward during expiration these muscles relax allowing the lungs to recoil and expel air passively each respiratory cycle has three phases inspiration expiration and a brief pause occurring roughly 1215 times per minute key lung volumes include tidal volume tv the normal air exchanged per breath inspiratory reserve volume irv expiratory reserve volume erv and residual volume rv all of which contribute to vital capacity vcthe maximum air a person can move in and out of the lungs lung elasticity compliance and airflow resistance impact breathing efficiency alveolar air enriched with co and water vapor is distinct from atmospheric air facilitating effective and continuous gas exchange within the alveoli even between breaths
diffusion of gases exchange of gases occurs when a difference in partial pressure exists across semipermeable membranes gases move by diffusion from the higher concentration to the lower until equilibrium is established p 26 atmospheric nitrogen is not used by the body so its partial pressure remains unchanged and is the same in inspired and expired air alveolar air and in the blood external respiration this is exchange of gases by diffusion between the alveoli and the blood each alveolar wall is one cell thick and is surrounded by a network of tiny capillaries the walls of which are also only one cell thick the total area for gas exchange in the lungs is 70 to 80 square metres venous blood arriving at the lungs has travelled from all the active tissues of the body and contains high levels of co2 and low levels of o2 carbon dioxide diffuses from venous blood down its concentration gradient into the alveoli until equilibrium with alveolar air is reached by the same process oxygen diffuses from the alveoli into the blood the slow flow of blood through the capillaries increases the time available for diffusion to occur when blood leaves the alveolar capillaries the oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations are in equilibrium with those of alveolar air fig 1023 internal respiration this is exchange of gases by diffusion between blood in the capillaries and the body cells gaseous exchange does not occur across the walls of the arteries carrying blood from the heart to the tissues because their walls are too thick po2 of blood arriving at the capillary bed is therefore the same as blood leaving the lungs blood arriving at the tissues has been cleansed of its co2 and saturated with o2 during its passage through the lungs and therefore has a higher po2 and a lower pco2 than the tissues this creates concentration gradients between the blood and the tissues and gaseous exchange therefore occurs fig 1024 o2 diffuses from the bloodstream through the capillary wall into the tissues co2 diffuses from the cells into the extracellular fluid then into the bloodstream towards the venous end of the capillary transport of gases in the bloodstream transport of blood oxygen and carbon dioxide is essential for internal respiration to occur oxygen oxygen is carried in the blood in chemical combination with haemoglobin as oxyhaemoglobin 985 of blood o2 in solution in plasma water 15 of blood o2 oxyhaemoglobin is an unstable compound that under certain conditions readily dissociates releasing oxygen factors that increase dissociation include raised carbon dioxide content of tissue fluid raised temperature and 23diphosphoglycerate 23dpg is a substance present in red blood cells in active tissues there is increased production of carbon dioxide and heat which leads to increased release of oxygen in this way oxygen is available to tissues in greatest need when oxygen leaves the erythrocyte the deoxygenated haemoglobin turns purplish in colour carbon dioxide carbon dioxide is one of the waste products of metabolism it is excreted by the lungs and is transported by three mechanisms most of it is in the form of bicarbonate ions hco3 in the plasma 70 of blood co2 some is dissolved in the plasma 7 of blood co2 some is carried in erythrocytes loosely combined with haemoglobin as carbaminohaemoglobin 23 of blood co2 control of respiration control of respiration is normally involuntary voluntary control is exerted during activities such as speaking and singing but is overridden if blood co2 rises hypercapnia the respiratory centre this is formed by groups of nerve cells that control the rate and depth of respiration fig 1025 they are situated in the brain stem in the medulla oblongata and the pons the interrelationship between these groups of cells is complex in the medulla there are inspiratory neurones and expiratory neurones neurones in the pneumotaxic and apneustic centres situated in the pons influence the inspiratory and expiratory neurones of the medulla motor impulses leaving the respiratory centre pass in the phrenic and intercostal nerves to the diaphragm and intercostal muscles respectively chemoreceptors these are receptors that respond to changes in the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid they are located centrally and peripherally central chemoreceptors these are on the surface of the medulla oblongata and are bathed in cerebrospinal fluid when the arterial pco2 rises hypercapnia even slightly the central chemoreceptors respond by stimulating the respiratory centre increasing ventilation of the lungs and reducing arterial pco2 the sensitivity of the central chemoreceptors to raised arterial pco2 is the most important factor in maintaining homeostasis of blood gases in health a small reduction in po2 hypoxaemia has the same but less pronounced effect but a substantial reduction has a depressing effect peripheral chemoreceptors these are situated in the arch of the aorta and in the carotid bodies fig 1025 they are more sensitive to small rises in arterial pco2 than to similarly low arterial po2 levels nerve impulses generated in the peripheral chemoreceptors are conveyed by the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves to the medulla and stimulate the respiratory centre the rate and depth of breathing are then increased an increase in blood acidity decreased ph or raised h stimulates the peripheral chemoreceptors resulting in increased ventilation increased co2 excretion and increased blood ph other factors that influence respiration breathing may be modified by the higher centres in the brain by speech singing emotional displays eg crying laughing fear drugs eg sedatives alcohol sleep temperature influences breathing in fever respiration is increased due to increased metabolic rate while in hypothermia it is depressed as is metabolism temporary changes in respiration occur in swallowing sneezing and coughing the heringbreuer reflex prevents overinflation of the lungs stretch receptors situated in the thoracic wall generate nerve inhibitory impulses when the lungs have inflated they travel via the vagus nerves to the respiratory centre normally quiet breathing is adequate to maintain arterial po2 and pco2 levels however on strenous exercise both the rate and depth of breathing increase increasing oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide excretion in order to meet increased needs and so maintain homeostasis when intense respiratory effort is required the accessory muscles of respiration are used the most important is the sternodeidomastoid fig 181 contraction of these muscles in addition to the diaphragm and intercostal muscles ensures the maximum increase in the capacity of the thoracic cavity effective control of respiration enables the body to maintain homeostasis of blood gases over a wide range of physiological environmental and pathological conditions,gas exchange occurs across semipermeable membranes through diffusion where gases move from high to low partial pressures this process called external respiration takes place between alveoli and blood facilitated by thin alveolar and capillary walls venous blood rich in co and low in o releases co into the alveoli while absorbing o in internal respiration o diffuses from blood to tissues and co moves into blood for transport oxygen transport occurs mainly through oxyhaemoglobin in red blood cells while carbon dioxide is carried as bicarbonate ions dissolved plasma or carbaminohaemoglobin the respiratory centre in the brainstem regulates involuntary breathing chemoreceptors monitor co and o levels triggering respiratory adjustments for blood gas homeostasis central chemoreceptors in the medulla respond primarily to co increases while peripheral chemoreceptors in the aorta and carotid bodies react to blood acidity and ph changes adjusting ventilation to balance co and o respiratory rate varies with emotional states temperature and activities like speaking the heringbreuer reflex prevents lung overinflation by sending inhibitory signals to the brain thus respiratory control maintains oxygen supply and carbon dioxide removal across varying physiological needs
disorders of the upper respiratory tract infectious and inflammatory disorders inflammation of the upper respiratory tract can be caused by inhaling irritants but is commonly due to infection such infections are usually caused by viruses that lower the resistance of the respiratory tract to other infections this allows bacteria dormant in the tract to invade the tissues such infections are a threat to life only if they spread to the lungs or other organs inflammatory swelling and exudate block the airway microbes are usually spread by droplet infection in dust or by contaminated equipment and dressings if not completely resolved acute infection may become chronic viruses enter host cells and replicate inside them where they are protected both from the bodys own defences and from many drug treatments interferons secreted by lymphocytes provide some degree of protection against viruses by limiting their ability to replicate p 374 viral infections cause acute inflammation of mucous membrane leading to tissue congestion and profuse exudate of watery fluid secondary infection by bacteria usually results in purulent discharge viral infections commonly cause severe illness and sometimes death in infants young children and the elderly in adults influenza is an incapacitating condition but is rarely fatal unless infection spreads to the lungs common cold and influenza the common cold coryza is usually caused by the rhinoviruses and is a highly infectious normally mild illness characterised mainly by a runny nose rhinorrhoea sneezing sore throat and sometimes slight fever normally a cold runs its course over a few days influenza is caused by a different group of viruses and produces far more severe symptoms than a cold including very high temperatures and muscle pains complete recovery can take weeks and secondary bacterial infections are more common than with a simple cold sinusitis this is usually caused by spread of microbes from the nose and pharynx to the mucous membrane lining the paranasal sinuses in maxillary sphenoidal ethmoidal and frontal bones the primary viral infection is usually followed by bacterial infection eg streptococcus pyogenes streptococcus pneumoniae staphylococcus aureus the congested mucosa may block the openings between the nose and the sinuses preventing drainage of mucopurulent discharge if there are repeated attacks or if recovery is not complete the infection may become chronic tonsillitis viruses and streptococcus pyogenes are common causes of inflammation of the palatine tonsils palatine arches and walls of the pharynx severe infection may lead to suppuration and abscess formation quinsy occasionally the infection spreads into the neck causing cellulitis following acute tonsillitis swelling subsides and the tonsil returns to normal but repeated infection may lead to chronic inflammation fibrosis and permanent enlargement endotoxins from tonsillitis caused by streptococcus pyogenes are associated with the development of rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis the nasopharyngeal tonsils lie on the upper wall of the nasopharynx fig 103 and when inflamed are better known as the adenoids temporary enlargement is a protective reaction to infection of nasal and pharyngeal mucosa and the tissue returns to normal after the infection has subsided but repeated infections can leave them enlarged and fibrotic this can cause airway obstruction and can be a problem especially in children pharyngitis this usually accompanies common colds and tonsillitis viruses with superimposed bacterial infection cause acute inflammation of the mucous membrane of the pharynx nose and sinuses laryngitis and tracheitis the larynx and trachea are subject to the same viral and bacterial infections as the nose and pharynx the infection may become chronic expecially in tobacco smokers and people who live or work in a polluted atmosphere acute inflammation may follow damage caused by an endotracheal tube especially if it is used for long periods or has an inflated cuff laryngotracheobronchitis croup in children is a rare but serious complication of upper respiratory tract infections the airway is obstructed by marked swelling around the larynx and epiglottis accompanied by wheeze and breathlessness dyspnoea diphtheria this is an infection of the pharynx caused by corynebacterium diphtheriae that may extend to the nasopharynx and trachea a thick fibrous membrane forms over the area and may obstruct the airway powerful exotoxins may severely damage cardiac and skeletal muscle the liver kidneys and adrenal glands where immunisation is widespread diphtheria is comparatively rare hay fever allergic rhinitis in this condition atopic immediate hypersensitivity develops to foreign proteins antigens eg pollen mites in pillow feathers animal dander the acute nonmicrobial inflammation of nasal mucosa and conjunctiva causes rhinorrhoea excessive watery exudate from the nose redness of the eyes and excessive secretion of tears the first time the antigen is encountered and absorbed ige antibodies are produced by blymphocytes which adhere to the surface of mast cells and basophils in the mucosa subsequent contact with the same antigen causes an immediate antigenantibody reaction stimulating the release of histamine and related substances from the granules of mast cells and basophils these substances cause vasodilatation increased permeability of capillary walls hypersecretion by glands and swelling of tissues see fig 151 p 375 atopic hypersensitivity tends to run in families but no genetic factor has yet been identified other forms of atopic hypersensitivity include childhood onset asthma see below eczema in infants and young children food allergies tumours benign haemangiomata these occur in the nasal septum they consist of abnormal proliferations of blood vessels interspersed with collagen fibres of irregular size and arrangement the blood vessels tend to rupture and cause persistent bleeding epistaxis malignant carcinoma of the nose sinuses nasopharynx and larynx is relatively rare diseases of the bronchi acute bronchitis this is usually a secondary bacterial infection of the bronchi it is usually preceded by a common cold or influenza and it may also complicate measles and whooping cough in children the viruses depress normal defence mechanisms allowing bacteria already present in the respiratory tract to multiply eg streptococcus pneumoniae haemophilus influenzae streptococcus pyogenes staphylococcus aureus downward spread of infection may lead to bronchiolitis and bronchopneumonia may develop especially in children and in debilitated often elderly adults chronic bronchitis chronic bronchitis is defined clinically when an individual has had a cough with sputum for 3 months in 2 successive years it is a progressive inflammatory disease resulting from prolonged irritation of the bronchial epithelium one or more of the following predisposing factors are usually present acute bronchitis commonly caused by haemophilus influenzae or streptococcus pneumoniae cigarette smoking atmospheric pollutants eg motor vehicle exhaust fumes industrial chemicals sulphur dioxide urban fog previous episodes of acute bronchitis it develops mostly in middleaged men who are chronic heavy smokers and may have a familial predisposition the changes occurring in the mucous membrane of the bronchi include thickening increase in the number and size of mucous glands oedema reduction in the number of ciliated cells narrowing of bronchioles due to fibrosis following repeated inflammatory episodes reduced ciliary activity causes stagnation in the bronchi of the excessive amount of mucus secreted if the mucus and bronchial lining are colonised by bacteria pus is formed stagnant mucus may partially or completely obstruct small bronchioles the severe difficulty in breathing dyspnoea with active expiratory effort raises the air pressure in the alveoli and may rupture the alveolar walls causing emphysema p 261 damp cold conditions tend to exacerbate the disease and spread of infected mucus to the alveoli may cause pneumonia as the disease progresses inflamed tissue of the bronchi is progressively replaced by fibrous tissue ventilation of the lungs is severely impaired causing breathlessness leading to hypoxia pulmonary hypertension and rightsided heart failure as respiratory failure develops arterial blood po2 is reduced hypoxaemia and is accompanied by a rise in arterial blood pco2 hypercapnia when the condition becomes more severe the respiratory centre in the medulla responds to hypoxaemia rather than to hypercapnia asthma asthma is an inflammatory disease of the airways in which the mucous membrane and muscle layers of the bronchi become thickened and the mucous glands enlarge reducing airflow in the lower respiratory tract during an asthmatic attack spasmodic contraction of bronchial muscle bronchospasm constricts the airway and there is excessive secretion of thick sticky mucus which further reduces the airway inspiration is normal but only partial expiration is achieved so the lungs become hyperinflated and there is severe dyspnoea and wheezing the duration of attacks usually varies from a few minutes to hours and very occasionally days status asthmaticus in severe acute attacks the bronchi may be obstructed by mucus plugs leading to acute respiratory failure hypoxia and possibly death nonspecific factors that may precipitate asthma attacks include cold air cigarette smoking air pollution upper respiratory tract infection emotional stress strenuous exercise there are two types of asthma which generally give rise to identical symptoms and are treated in the same way important differences include typical age of onset and the contribution of an element of allergy childhood onset extrinsic allergic atopic asthma this type occurs in children and young adults who have atopic type 1 hypersensitivity to foreign protein eg pollen dust containing mites from carpets feather pillows animal dander fungi a history of infantile eczema or food allergies is common and there are often close family members with a history of allergy the same disease process occurs as in hay fever antigens allergens are inhaled and absorbed by the bronchial mucosa this stimulates the production of ige antibodies that bind to the surface of mast cells and basophils round the bronchial blood vessels when the allergen is encountered again the antigenantibody reaction results in the release of histamine and other related substances that stimulate mucus secretion and muscle contraction attacks tend to become less frequent and less severe with age adult onset intrinsic asthma this type occurs later in adult life and there is no history of childhood allergic reactions it is associated with chronic inflammation of the upper respiratory tract eg chronic bronchitis nasal polyps antigens are rarely identified but drug hypersensitivity may develop later especially to aspirin and penicillin attacks tend to increase in severity and there may be irreversible damage to the lungs eventually impaired lung ventilation leads to hypoxia pulmonary hypertension and rightsided heart failure most asthmatics whatever the aetiology can usually have their disease well controlled with inhaled antiinflammatory and bronchodilator agents and live a normal life bronchiectasis this is permanent abnormal dilatation of bronchi and bronchioles it is associated with chronic bacterial infection and in some cases there is a history of childhood bronchiolitis and bronchopneumonia cystic fibrosis or bronchial tumour the bronchi become obstructed by mucus pus and inflammatory exudate and the alveoli distal to the blockage collapse as trapped air is absorbed interstitial elastic tissue degenerates and is replaced by fibrous adhesions that attach the bronchi to the parietal pleura the pressure of inspired air in these damaged bronchi leads to dilatation proximal to the blockage the persistent severe coughing to remove copious purulent sputum causes intermittent increases in pressure in the blocked bronchi leading to further dilatation the lower lobe of the lung is usually affected suppuration is common if a blood vessel is eroded haemoptysis may occur or pyaemia leading to abscess formation elsewhere in the body commonly the brain progressive fibrosis of the lung leads to hypoxia pulmonary hypertension and rightsided heart failure,upper respiratory tract disorders infections and inflammation common cold and influenza viral infections causing mild to severe symptoms influenza may result in secondary bacterial infections sinusitis infection in the sinuses typically viral with secondary bacterial invasion tonsillitis and pharyngitis inflammation of the tonsilspharynx severe cases can cause chronic inflammation and possible complications laryngitis and tracheitis infections can become chronic particularly in smokers leading to airway obstruction diphtheria caused by corynebacterium diphtheriae forming a thick membrane that may block the airway allergic reactions hay fever allergic rhinitis triggered by allergens like pollen causing nasal inflammation tumors benign and malignant tumors rare but can cause nasal bleeding or obstruction lower respiratory tract disorders bronchitis acute bronchitis often follows a cold may lead to pneumonia chronic bronchitis persistent cough with sputum due to prolonged irritation eg smoking pollutants asthma childhood onset allergicextrinsic triggered by allergens leading to bronchospasms adult onset nonallergicintrinsic associated with chronic inflammation becoming more severe with age bronchiectasis permanent bronchial dilation due to chronic infection can lead to severe lung issues and heart failure
disorders of the lungs emphysema fig 1026 pulmonary emphysema in this form of the disease there is irreversible distension of the respiratory bronchioles alveolar ducts and alveoli reducing the surface area for the exchange of gases there are two main types and both are usually present panacinar emphysema the walls between adjacent alveoli break down the alveolar ducts dilate and there is loss of interstitial elastic tissue the lungs become distended and their capacity is increased because the volume of air in each breath remains unchanged it constitutes a smaller proportion of the total volume of air in the distended alveoli reducing the partial pressure of oxygen the consequence of this is to reduce the concentration gradient of o2 across the alveolar membrane therefore decreasing diffusion of o2 into the blood the merging of alveoli reduces the surface area for diffusion of gases homeostasis of arterial blood o2 and co2 levels is maintained at rest by hyperventilation as the disease progresses the combined effect of these changes may lead to hypoxia pulmonary hypertension and eventually rightsided heart failure predisposing factors include cigarette smoking believed to promote the release of proteolytic enzymes from mast cells and basophils in the lungs acute inflammation of bronchi and lungs increased pressure caused by coughing which stretches the already damaged structures congenital deficiency of an antiproteolytic enzyme cqantitrypsin which causes deficiency of supporting elastic tissue in the lungs centrilobular emphysema in this form there is irreversible dilatation of the respiratory bronchioles in the centre of lobules when inspired air reaches the dilated area the pressure falls leading to a reduction in alveolar air pressure reduced ventilation efficiency and reduced partial pressure of oxygen as the disease progresses the resultant hypoxia leads to pulmonary hypertension and rightsided heart failure predisposing conditions exacerbated by persistent severe coughing include recurrent bronchiolitis pneumoconiosis chronic bronchitis and cigarette smoking interstitial emphysema interstitial emphysema means the presence of air in the thoracic interstitial tissues and this may happen in one of the following ways from the outside by injury eg fractured rib stab wound from the inside when an alveolus ruptures through the pleura eg during an asthmatic attack in bronchiolitis coughing as in whooping cough the air in the tissues usually tracks upwards to the soft tissues of the neck where it is gradually absorbed causing no damage a large quantity in the mediastinum may limit heart movement pneumonia fig 1027 this occurs when protective processes fail to prevent inhaled or bloodborne microbes reaching and colonising the lungs the following are some predisposing factors impaired coughing the effectiveness of coughing as an aid to the removal of infected mucus may be reduced when the individual is unconscious or by damage to sensory nerve endings in the walls of the respiratory passages the cough reflex centre in the medulla oblongata nerves to the respiratory passages lungs and muscles of respiration the diaphragm and intercostal muscles voluntary inhibition may occur if coughing causes pain eg following abdominal surgery damage to the epithelial lining of the tract ciliary action may be impaired or the epithelium destroyed by eg tobacco smoking inhaling noxious gases infection defective alveolar phagocytosis depressed macrophage activity may be caused by tobacco smoking alcohol anoxia oxygen toxicity pulmonary oedema and congestion bronchopneumonia frequently occurs in patients with hypostatic pulmonary oedema and congestive heart failure the relationship is not clear general lowering of resistance to infection factors involved include leukopenia chronic diseases impaired immune response caused by eg ionising radiation corticosteroid drugs unusually virulent infections hypothermia lobar pneumonia this is infection of one or more lobes by streptococcus pneumoniae mainly types 1 2 and 3 the infection leads to production of watery inflammatory exudate in the alveoli this accumulates and fills the lobule then overflows into adjacent lobules spreading the microbes it is of sudden onset and pleuritic pain accompanies inflammation of the visceral pleura if not treated by antibacterial drugs the disease goes through a series of stages followed by resolution and reinflation of the lobes in 2 to 3 weeks complications of lobar pneumonia incomplete resolution if the fibrous exudate formed as the infection subsides is not completely cleared it may become permanently solid tough leathery and airless reducing the surface area for gaseous exchange pleural effusion and empyema when infection spreads to the pleura inflammatory exudate accumulates effusion in the pleural cavity and pus is formed empyema healing may lead to formation of fibrous adhesions which prevent normal expansion of the lung spread of infection this may be to local tissues or cause pericarditis acute endocarditis meningitis acute otitis media arthritis lung abscess this may develop but only rarely when antimicrobial drugs are available cardiac complications these include endocarditis or toxic myocarditis that may lead to heart failure especially in elderly people bronchopneumonia infection is spread from the bronchi to terminal bronchioles and alveoli as these become inflamed fibrous exudate accumulates and there is an influx of leukocytes small foci of consolidation develop there is frequently incomplete resolution with fibrosis bronchiectasis is a common complication leading to further acute attacks lung fibrosis and progressive destruction of lung substance bronchopneumonia occurs most commonly in infancy and old age and death is fairly common especially when the condition complicates debilitating diseases predisposing factors include debility due to eg cancer uraemia cerebral haemorrhage congestive heart failure malnutrition hypothermia chronic bronchitis bronchiectasis cystic fibrosis general anaesthetics which depress respiratory and ciliary activity acute viral infections inhalation of gastric contents in eg unconsciousness very deep sleep following excessive alcohol consumption drug overdose inhalation of infected material from the paranasal sinuses or upper respiratory tract microbes causing bronchopneumonia staphylococcus aureus infection is usually preceded by influenza measles whooping cough or chronic lung disease incomplete resolution may cause abscess formation with rupture into the pleural cavity empyema and possibly pneumothorax pleural adhesions may form during healing and limit lung expansion friedlanders bacillus klebsiella pneumoniae this commensal is sometimes present in the upper respiratory tract especially where there is advanced dental caries it commonly causes pneumonia in men over 50 years and is often associated with diabetes mellitus and alcoholism legionella pneumonophila these microbes are widely distributed in water tanks shower heads and air conditioning systems and are therefore commonly found in institutions such as hospitals and hotels they may cause a severe form of pneumonia legionnaires disease complicated by gastrointestinal disturbances headache mental confusion and renal failure streptococcus pyogenes infection is usually preceded by influenza or measles in very severe cases death may occur within a few days pseudomonas pyocyanea this organism causes a type of pneumonia acquired by crossinfection in hospitals especially in patients with mechanically assisted ventilation or tracheostomy it is resistant to many antibacterial agents and multiplies at room temperature in eg water soap solution eye drops ointments weak antiseptics streptococcus pneumoniae pneumococcus this is a commensal in the respiratory tract which may cause lobar pneumonia or bronchopneumonia usually preceded by virus infection it affects mainly debilitated bedridden patients when there is stagnation of mucus in the respiratory passages other organisms some viruses protozoa and fungi may cause pneumonia in people whose general resistance is lowered or whose immune systems are depressed by eg drugs lung abscess local suppuration and necrosis within the lung substance is most commonly caused by streptococcus viridans streptococcus pyogenes streptococcus pneumoniae staphylococcus aureus sources of infection inhalation infected matter from the paranasal sinuses gums and the upper respiratory passages may be inhaled an important predisposing factor is inhalation of regurgitated gastric contents that may occur during coma emergency anaesthesia very deep sleep following alcohol consumption drug overdose or sniffing volatile gases from eg glue aspiration pneumonia the hydrochloric acid and food particles cause severe irritation of the upper respiratory tract allowing bacteria already present to invade the tissues and spread to the lungs pneumonia lung abscess may complicate pneumonia especially when the latter is caused by staphylococcus aureus streptococcus pneumoniae or friedlanders bacillus septic embolism thrombophlebitis and rightsided endocarditis are the main sources of septic emboli that cause lung abscess traumatic penetration of the lung pathogenic microbes may enter the lung when both skin and lung are penetrated eg in compound fracture of rib stab wound gunshot wound during surgery local spread of infection microbes may spread from the pleural cavity oesophagus spine or a subphrenic abscess recovery from lung abscess may be complete or lead to complications eg chronic suppuration septic emboli may spread to other parts of the body eg the brain causing cerebral abscess or meningitis subpleural abscesses may spread and cause empyema and possibly bronchopleural fistula formation erosion of a pulmonary blood vessel leading to haemorrhage,lung disorders emphysema a chronic irreversible condition where alveoli and bronchioles distend reducing gas exchange panacinar emphysema adjacent alveoli break down losing elastic tissue and causing hypoxia pulmonary hypertension and potential rightsided heart failure main causes include smoking and alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency centrilobular emphysema bronchioles in lobule centers dilate reducing oxygen intake and often leading to heart complications linked to smoking and chronic infections pneumonia lung inflammation from microbial infection risk factors include impaired coughing epithelial damage and lowered immunity lobar pneumonia often caused by streptococcus pneumoniae affecting one or more lobes and spreading through exudate complications include pleural effusion empyema and cardiac issues bronchopneumonia infection spreads from bronchi to alveoli causing fibrosis seen in elderly infants or chronic disease patients caused by bacteria like staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella lung abscess localized infection leading to necrosis often following aspiration or embolism it can cause systemic infection empyema and hemorrhage
tuberculosis this infection is caused by one of two forms of mycobacteria mycobacterium tuberculosis humans are the main host the microbes cause pulmonary tuberculosis and are spread either by droplet infection from an individual with active tuberculosis or in dust contaminated by infected sputum mycobacterium bovis animals are the main host the microbes are usually spread to humans by untreated milk from infected cows causing infection of the alimentary tract in britain the incidence has been greatly reduced by the elimination of bovine tuberculosis and the pasteurisation of milk it is still a significant infection in many countries phases of pulmonary tuberculosis primary tuberculosis when microbes are inhaled they colonise a lung bronchiole usually towards the apex of the lung there may be no evidence of clinical disease during the initial stage of nonspecific inflammation later cellmediated tlymphocytes respond to the microbes antigens and the individual becomes sensitised macrophages surround the microbes at the site of infection forming ghon foci tubercles some macrophages containing live microbes are spread in lymph and infect hilar lymph nodes primary complexes are formed consisting of ghon foci plus infected hilar lymph nodes necrosis caseation may reduce the core of foci to a cheeselike substance consisting of dead macrophages dead lung tissue and live and dead microbes primary tuberculosis is usually asymptomatic there are various outcomes the disease may be permanently arrested the foci becoming fibrosed and calcified microbes may survive in the foci and become the source of postprimary infection months or years later the disease may spread throughout the lung forming multiple small foci to the respiratory passages causing bronchopneumonia or bronchiectasis to the pleura causing pleurisy with or without effusion to other parts of the body via lymph and blood leading to wide spread of the infection and the development of numerous small foci throughout the body miliary tuberculosis weight loss and malaise develop insidiously and night sweats are common secondary postprimary tuberculosis this phase occurs only in people previously sensitised by a primary lesion usually situated in the apex of one or both lungs it may be caused by a new infection or by reactivation of infection by microbes surviving in ghon foci as sensitisation has already occurred tlymphocytes stimulate an immediate immune reaction followed by phagocytosis the subsequent course of the disease is variable eg it may be arrested healing occurring with fibrosis and calcification of the foci foci containing live microbes may be walled off by fibrous tissue becoming a potential source of future infection live microbes in foci may break out through the fibrous walls and cause further infection pleurisy with or without effusion or empyema may develop haemoptysis expectoration of bloodstained sputum may occur if a small blood vessel is eroded and bleeds into the respiratory tract caseous material containing live microbes may be expectorated leaving cavities in the lung and become a source of infection of the other lung bronchi trachea and larynx the alimentary tract when microbes are swallowed microbes may spread in blood and lymph leading to widespread infection and the development of numerous small foci throughout the body miliary tuberculosis bovine tuberculosis follows the same course but primary complexes develop in the intestines pneumoconioses occupational lung diseases this group of lung diseases is caused by inhaling organic or inorganic atmospheric pollutants to cause pneumoconiosis particles must be so small that they are carried in inspired air to the level of the respiratory bronchioles and alveoli where they can only be cleared by phagocytosis larger particles are trapped by mucus higher up the tract and expelled by ciliary action and coughing other contributory factors include high concentration of pollutants in the air long exposure to pollutants reduced numbers of macrophages and ineffectual phagocytosis cigarette smoking coal workers pneumoconiosis this is caused by inhaling dust from soft bituminous coal it occurs in two forms simple pneumoconiosis the particles of coal dust lodge mainly in the upper twothirds of the lungs and are ingested by macrophages inside the alveoli some macrophages remain in the alveoli and some move out into the surrounding tissues and adhere to the outside of the alveolar walls respiratory bronchioles blood vessels and to the visceral pleura macrophages are unable to digest inorganic particles and when they die they are surrounded by fibrous tissue fibrosis is progressive during exposure to coal dust but tends to stop when exposure stops early in the disease there may be few clinical signs unless emphysema develops or there is concurrent chronic bronchitis pneumoconiosis with progressive massive fibrosis this develops in a small number of cases sometimes after the worker is no longer exposed to coal dust masses of fibrous tissue develop and progressively encroach on the blood vessels and bronchioles large parts of the lung are destroyed and emphysema is extensive leading to pulmonary oedema pulmonary hypertension and rightsided cardiac failure the reasons for the severity of the disease are not clear one factor may be hypersensitivity to antigens released by the large number of dead macrophages about 40 of the patients have tuberculosis silicosis this may be caused by longterm exposure to dust containing silicon compounds highrisk industries are quarrying granite slate sandstone mining hard coal gold tin copper stone masonry and sand blasting glass and pottery work when silica particles are inhaled they accumulate in the alveoli the particles are ingested by macrophages some of which remain in the alveoli and some move out into the connective tissues around respiratory bronchioles and blood vessels and close to the pleura progressive fibrosis is stimulated which eventually obliterates the blood vessels and respiratory bronchioles fibrous adhesions form between the two layers of pleura and eventually fix the lung to the chest wall the relationship between the presence of silicon and the production of excess fibrous tissue is not clear it may be that inflammation is caused by silicic acid which gradually forms when silicon compounds dissolve there is an immune reaction in which silicon is the antigen fibrosis is stimulated by enzymes released when macrophages containing silicon die silicosis appears to predispose to the development of tuberculosis which rapidly progresses to tubercular bronchopneumonia and possibly to miliary tuberculosis gradual destruction of lung tissue leads to pulmonary hypertension and rightsided heart failure asbestosrelated diseases disease caused by inhaling asbestos fibres usually develop after 10 to 20 years exposure but sometimes after only 2 years asbestos miners and workers involved in making and using some products containing asbestos are at risk the types associated with disease are crocidolite blue asbestos chrysotile white asbestos and amosite brown asbestos asbestosis this occurs when asbestos fibres are inhaled in dust in spite of their large size the particles penetrate to the level of respiratory bronchioles and alveoli macrophages accumulate in the alveoli and the shorter fibres are ingested the larger fibres form asbestos bodies consisting of fibres surrounded by macrophages protein material and iron deposits their presence in sputum indicates exposure to asbestos but not necessarily that there is asbestosis the macrophages that have engulfed fibres move out of the alveoli and accumulate round respiratory bronchioles and blood vessels stimulating the formation of fibrous tissue there is progressive destruction of lung tissue with the development of dyspnoea chronic hypoxia pulmonary hypertension and rightsided cardiac failure the link between inhaled asbestos and fibrosis is not clear it may be that asbestos stimulates the macrophages to secrete enzymes that promote fibrosis or that it stimulates an immune reaction causing fibrosis pleural mesothelioma the majority of cases of this malignant tumour of the pleura are linked with previous exposure to asbestos dust eg asbestos workers and people living near asbestos mines and factories mesothelioma may develop after widely varying duration of exposure to asbestos from 3 months to 60 years and is usually associated with crocidolite fibres blue asbestos the latent period between exposure and the appearance of symptoms may range from 10 to 40 years the tumour involves both layers of pleura and as it grows it obliterates the pleural cavity compressing the lung lymph and bloodspread metastases are commonly found in the hilar and mesenteric lymph nodes the other lung liver thyroid and adrenal glands bone skeletal muscle and brain byssinosis this is caused by the inhalation of fibres of cotton flax and hemp over a period of years the fibres cause bronchial irritation and possibly the release of histaminelike substances at first breathless attacks similar to asthma occur only when the individual is at work later they become more persistent and chronic bronchitis and emphysema may develop leading to chronic hypoxia pulmonary hypertension and rightsided heart failure extrinsic allergic alveolitis this group of conditions is caused by inhaling materials contaminated by moulds and fungi eg those in table 103 the contaminants act as antigens causing antigenantibody reactions in the walls of the alveoli there is excess fluid exudate and the accumulation of platelets lymphocytes and plasma cells the alveolar walls become thick and there is progressive fibrosis leading to pulmonary hypertension and rightsided heart failure,tuberculosis tuberculosis tb is caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis human host or mycobacterium bovis animal host m tuberculosis spreads through droplets or contaminated dust causing pulmonary tb in humans while m bovis is transmitted via untreated milk mainly affecting the alimentary tract primary tuberculosis initial infection occurs when bacteria colonize the lung apex forming tubercles or ghon foci primary tb may be asymptomatic arrested by fibrosis or may spread to other organs via lymph and blood potentially causing miliary tb secondary tuberculosis this reactivation phase occurs in previously infected individuals primarily in lung apices it can lead to fibrosis cavitation and potentially disseminate via blood or lymph pneumoconioses occupational lung diseases this category includes diseases from inhaling small airborne particles leading to lung inflammation and fibrosis coal workers pneumoconiosis coal dust particles cause lung fibrosis potentially leading to massive fibrosis emphysema and cardiac failure silicosis caused by inhaling silica dust leading to fibrosis pleural adhesions and an increased risk of tuberculosis asbestosis inhalation of asbestos fibers leads to lung fibrosis hypoxia and risk of mesothelioma a malignant pleural tumor
chemically induced lung diseases paraquat lldimethyl44 bipyridylium chloride within hours of ingestion of this weedkiller it is bloodborne to the lungs and begins to cause irreversible damage the alveolar membrane becomes swollen pulmonary oedema develops and alveolar epithelium is destroyed the kidneys are also damaged and death may be due to combined respiratory and renal failure or cardiac failure cytotoxic drugs busulphan bleomycin methotrexate these and other drugs used in cancer treatment may cause inflammation that heals by fibrosis of interstitial tissue in the lungs and is followed by alveolar fibrosis oxygen toxicity the lungs may be damaged by a high concentration of oxygen administered for several days eg in intensive care units to premature babies in incubators the mechanisms involved are unknown but effects include m progressive decrease in lung compliance pulmonary oedema fibrosis of lung tissue breakdown of capillary walls in severe cases pneumonia may develop followed by pulmonary hypertension and rightsided heart failure retinopathy of prematurity this affects premature babies requiring highconcentration oxygen therapy the oxygen may stimulate immature retinal blood vessels to constrict causing fibrosis retinal detachment and blindness p 211 bronchial carcinoma primary bronchial carcinoma is a common form of malignancy the tumour usually develops in a main bronchus forming a large friable mass that projects into the lumen sometimes causing obstruction mucus then collects and predisposes to development of infection as the tumour grows it may erode a blood vessel causing haemoptysis the cause is not known but there is a strong positive association with cigarette smoking and the inhalation of other peoples smoke passive smoking spread of bronchial cancer this does not follow any particular pattern or sequence the modes of spread are infiltration of local tissues and the transport of tumour fragments in blood and lymph if blood or lymph vessels are eroded fragments may spread while the tumour is quite small a metastatic tumour may therefore cause symptoms before the primary in the lung has been detected local spread this may be within the lung to the other lung or to mediastinal structures eg blood vessels nerves oesophagus lymphatic spread tumour fragments spread along lymph vessels to successive lymph nodes in which they may cause metastatic tumours fragments may enter lymph draining from a tumour or gain access to a larger vessel when its walls have been eroded by a growing tumour early symptoms may be due to pressure caused by enlarged lymph nodes in the thorax blood spread tumour cells usually enter the blood when a blood vessel is eroded by local spread of the tumour the most common sites of bloodborne metastases are the liver brain adrenal glands bones and kidneys lung collapse fig1028 the clinical effects of collapse of all or part of a lung depend on how much of the lung is affected fairly large sections of a single lung can be out of action without obvious symptoms the term atelectasis is often used to described lung collapse there are four main causes of this condition obstruction of an airway absorption collapse impaired surfactant function pressure collapse alveolar hypoventilation obstruction of an airway absorption collapse the amount of lung affected depends on the size of the obstructed air passage distal to the obstruction air is trapped and absorbed the lung collapses and secretions collect these may become infected causing abscess formation shortterm obstruction is usually followed by reinflation of the lung without lasting illeffects prolonged obstruction leads to progressive fibrosis and permanent collapse sudden obstruction may be due to inhalation of a foreign body or a mucus plug formed during an asthmatic attack or in chronic bronchitis gradual obstruction may be due to a bronchial tumour or pressure on a bronchus by eg enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes aortic aneurysm impaired surfactant function premature babies born before the 34th week are unable to expand their lungs by their own respiratory effort because their lungs are too immature to produce surfactant p 249 surfactant coats the inner surface of each alveolus and reduces surface tension allowing alveolar expansion during inspiration these babies need to be mechanically ventilated until their lungs begin to produce surfactant this problem is called respiratory disease of the newborn rdn in the condition called adult respiratory distress syndrome ards dilution of surfactant by fluid collecting in the alveoli pulmonary oedema causes surfactant efficiency to be reduced and atelectasis follows these patients are often gravely ill already and collapse of substantial areas of lung contributes to the mortality rate of around 50 pressure collapse when air or fluid enters the pleural cavity the negative pressure becomes positive preventing lung expansion the collapse usually affects only one lung and may be partial or complete there is no obstruction of the airway pneumothorax in this condition there is air in the pleural cavity it may occur spontaneously or be the result of trauma spontaneous pneumothorax this may be either primary or secondary primary spontaneous pneumothorax is of unknown cause and occurs in fit and healthy people usually males between 20 and 40 years secondary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs when air enters the pleural cavity traumatic pneumothorax this is due to a penetrating injury eg compound fracture of rib stab or gunshot wound surgery tension pneumothorax this occurs as a complication when a flap or oneway valve develops between the lungs and the pleural cavity air enters the pleural cavity during inspiration but cannot escape on expiration and steadily accumulates this causes shift of the mediastinum and compression of the other lung resulting in severe respiratory distress and is often fatal haemothorax this is blood in the pleural cavity it may be caused by penetrating chest injury involving blood vessels ruptured aortic aneurysm erosion of a blood vessel by a malignant tumourafter the visceral pleura ruptures due to lung disease eg emphysema asthma pulmonary tuberculosis bronchial cancer pleural effusion this is excess fluid in the pleural cavity and may be caused by increased hydrostatic pressure eg heart failure increased blood volume increased capillary permeability due to local inflammation eg pneumonia pulmonary tuberculosis bronchial cancer mesothelioma decreased plasma osmotic pressure eg nephrotic syndrome p 352 cirrhosis of the liver p 335 impaired lymphatic drainage eg malignant tumour involving the pleura fibrous adhesions which limit reinflation may form between the layers of pleura following haemothorax and pleural effusion alveolar hypoventilation in the normal individual breathing quietly at rest there will always be some atelectatic lobules within the lungs due to the low tidal volume these lobules will reexpand without difficulty at the next deep inspiration another common cause of hypoventilation atelectasis occurs postoperatively particularly after chest and upper abdominal surgery when pain restricts thoracic expansion postoperative atelectasis predisposes to chest infections because mucus collects in the underventilated airways and is not expectorated,chemically induced lung diseases chemicals such as paraquat cytotoxic drugs and highconcentration oxygen can cause severe lung damage paraquat ingested paraquat reaches the lungs causing irreversible alveolar damage pulmonary edema and potential respiratory or renal failure cytotoxic drugs cancer drugs like busulfan and bleomycin may cause lung inflammation that leads to interstitial and alveolar fibrosis oxygen toxicity prolonged high oxygen levels can decrease lung compliance cause pulmonary edema and eventually fibrosis in infants it can lead to retinopathy of prematurity potentially causing blindness bronchial carcinoma a primary malignancy in the lungs often linked to smoking it can cause obstruction infection and haemoptysis tumors spread via blood and lymph with metastasis to organs such as the liver and brain lung collapse atelectasis caused by airway obstruction surfactant deficiency pressure changes or hypoventilation it includes obstruction collapse obstructions trap air leading to absorption and collapse possibly resulting in fibrosis impaired surfactant function common in premature infants and critically ill adults ards pressure collapse caused by pneumothorax or haemothorax which prevent lung expansion pleural conditions include pleural effusion pneumothorax and haemothorax leading to limited lung expansion and potential complications

carbohydrates these are found in a wide variety of foods eg sugar jam cereals bread biscuits pasta convenience foods fruit and vegetables they consist of carbon hydrogen and oxygen the hydrogen and oxygen being in the same proportion as in water carbohydrates are classified according to the complexity of the chemical substances of which they are formed monosaccharides carbohydrates are digested in the alimentary canal and when absorbed they are in the form of monosaccharides examples include glucose see fig 27 p 23 fructose and galactose these are chemically the simplest form in which a carbohydrate can exist they are made up of single units or molecules which if they were broken down further would cease to be sugars disaccharides these consist of two monosaccharide molecules chemically combined to form sugars eg sucrose see fig 27 maltose and lactose polysaccharides these consist of complex molecules made up of large numbers of monosaccharide molecules in chemical combination eg starches glycogen cellulose and dextrins not all polysaccharides can be digested by human beings eg cellulose and other substances present in vegetables fruit and some cereals pass through the alimentary canal almost unchanged functions of digestible carbohydrates these include provision of rapidly available energy and heat protein sparing ie when there is an adequate supply of carbohydrate in the diet protein does not need to be used to provide energy and heat provision of a store of energy when carbohydrate is eaten in excess of the bodys needs as it is converted to fat and deposited in the fat depots eg under the skin proteins or nitrogenous foods proteins are broken down into their constituent amino acids by digestion and it is in this form that they are absorbed through the intestinal wall dietary protein is the main source of nitrogen that can be used in the body if it is absent from the diet the body goes into negative nitrogen balance this is because amino acids are constantly being used to form enzymes hormones and cell proteins and the turnover of cells is accompanied by the formation of nitrogenous waste materials that are excreted by the kidneys amino acids see fig 28 these are composed of the elements carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen some contain minerals such as iron copper zinc iodine sulphur and phosphate they are divided into two categories essential and nonessential essential amino acids cannot be synthesised in the body therefore they must be included in the diet nonessential amino acids are those which can be synthesised in the body the essential and nonessential amino acids are shown in box 111 the nutritional value of a protein depends on the amino acids of which it is composed complete proteins this term is given to protein foods which contain all the essential amino acids in the proportions required to maintain health they are derived almost entirely from animal sources and include meat fish milk eggs soya beans and milk products excluding butter protein quality the nutritional value of a protein its quality is measured by how well it meets the nutritional needs of the body highquality protein is usually of animal origin easily digested and contains all essential amino acids in the proportions required by the body one way of measuring a proteins quality is to feed it to animals and measure how much is retained in the body for growth and repair this is called the biological value bv a balanced diet containing all the amino acids required may be achieved by eating a range of foods containing lowquality proteins provided that deficiencies in amino acid content of any one of the constituent proteins of the diet is supplied by another a balanced vegetarian diet which consists primarily of lowerquality protein eg vegetables cereals and pulses is based on this principle functions of proteins amino acids are used for growth and repair of body cells and tissues synthesis of enzymes plasma proteins antibodies immunoglobulins and some hormones provision of energy normally a secondary function this becomes important only when there is not enough carbohydrate in the diet and fat stores are depleted when protein is eaten in excess of the bodys needs the nitrogenous part is detached ie it is deaminated and excreted by the kidneys the remainder is converted to fat for storage in the fat depots eg in the fat cells of adipose tissue p 316 fats saturated or animal fat containing mainly saturated fatty acids and glycerol is found in milk cheese butter eggs meat and oily fish such as herring cod and halibut all animal sources of protein contain some saturated fat cholesterol is synthesised in the body and is also obtained in the diet from full fat dairy products fatty meat and egg yolk unsaturated or vegetable fat containing mainly unsaturated fatty acids and glycerol is found in some margarine and in most vegetable oils linoleic linolenic and arachidonic acids are polyunsaturated fatty acids that are essential in the diet because they cannot be synthesised in the body they are the precursors of prostaglandins thromboxanes and leukotrienes p 226 functions of fats these include provision of a source of chemical energy and heat support of certain body organs eg the kidneys the eyes transport and storage of the fatsoluble vitamins a d e k constituent of nerve sheaths and of sebum the secretion of sebaceous glands in the skin formation of cholesterol and steroid hormones storage of energy as fat in adipose tissue under the skin and in the mesentery when eaten in excess of requirements insulationas a subcutaneous layer it reduces heat loss through the skin satiety value when gastric contents chyme containing fat enter the duodenum the emptying time of the stomach is prolonged postponing the return of hunger,carbohydrates proteins and fats are essential nutrients with distinct roles in the body carbohydrates found in foods like sugar cereals and vegetables consist of carbon hydrogen and oxygen they are classified as monosaccharides singleunit sugars like glucose disaccharides twounit sugars like sucrose and polysaccharides complex sugars like starch they provide energy spare protein for other uses and are stored as fat if consumed in excess proteins are vital for cell growth repair and the production of enzymes hormones and antibodies made of amino acids essential and nonessential proteins are categorized by quality with highquality sources like meat and eggs containing all essential amino acids lowquality proteins found in vegetables and cereals can still meet dietary needs if combined appropriately fats include saturated fats from animal sources like milk and meat and unsaturated fats from plants like oils they supply energy support organs transport fatsoluble vitamins insulate the body and provide satiety essential fatty acids such as linoleic acid are precursors to key biological compounds and must be obtained from the diet
vitamins vitamins are chemical compounds required in very small quantities which are essential for normal metabolism and health they are found widely distributed in food and are divided into two main groups fatsoluble vitamins a d e and k watersoluble vitamins b complex c fatsoluble vitamins vitamin a retinol this vitamin is found in such foods as cream egg yolk liver fish oil milk cheese and butter it is absent from vegetable fats and oils but is added to margarine during manufacture it can be formed in the body from certain carotenes the main dietary sources of which are green vegetables fruit and carrots vitamin a and carotene are only absorbed from the small intestine satisfactorily if fat absorption is normal although some is synthesised in the body the daily dietary requirement is 600 to 700 ug the main roles of vitamin a in the body are generation of the lightsensitive pigment rhodopsin visual purple in the retina of the eye cell growth and differentiation this is especially important in fastgrowing cells such as the epithelial cells covering both internal and external body surfaces promotion of immunity and defence against infection promotion of growth eg in bones the first sign of vitamin a deficiency is night blindness due to defective retinal pigment other consequences include xerophthalmia which is drying and thickening of the conjunctiva and ultimately there is ulceration and destruction of the conjunctiva this is a common cause of blindness in developing countries atrophy and keratinisation of other epithelial tissues leads to increased incidence of infections of the ear and the respiratory genitourinary and alimentary tracts immunity is compromised and bone development may be slow and faulty vitamin d vitamin d3 is found mainly in animal fats such as eggs butter cheese fish liver oils humans and other animals can synthesise vitamin d by the action of the ultraviolet rays of the sun on a form of cholesterol in the skin 7dehydrocholesterol vitamin d regulates calcium and phosphate metabolism by increasing their absorption in the gut and stimulating their retention by the kidneys it therefore promotes the calcification of bones and teeth deficiency causes rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults due to deficient absorption and utilisation of calcium and phosphate the daily requirement is 10 ug and stores in fat and muscle are such that deficiency may not be apparent for several years vitamin e this is a group of eight substances called tocopherols they are found in nuts egg yolk wheat germ whole cereal milk and butter vitamin e is an antioxidant which means that it protects body constituents such as membrane lipids from being destroyed in oxidative reactions deficiency is rare because of the widespread occurrence of this vitamin in foods and is usually seen only in premature babies and in conditions associated with impaired fat absorption eg cystic fibrosis haemolytic anaemia occurs as abnormal red blood cell membranes rupture white blood cells can likewise be affected and vitamin e supplements boost immune function neurological abnormalities such as ataxia and visual disturbances may occur if the deficiency is severe recently vitamin e has been shown to protect against coronary artery disease recommended daily intake is 10 mg for men and 8 mg for women but this should be increased in highfat diets vitamin k the sources of vitamin k are fish liver leafy green vegetables and fruit it is synthesised in the large intestine by microbes and significant amounts are absorbed absorption is dependent upon the presence of bile salts in the small intestine the normal daily requirement is 1 ugkg body weight and only a small amount is stored in the liver and spleen vitamin k is required by the liver for the production of prothrombin and factors vii ix and x all essential for the clotting of blood p 67 deficiency therefore prevents normal blood coagulation it may occur in adults when there is obstruction to the flow of bile severe liver damage and in malabsorption conditions such as coeliac disease newborn infants may be given vitamin k because their intestines are sterile and require several weeks to become colonised with vitamin kproducing bacteria watersoluble vitamins vitamin b complex this is a group of watersoluble vitamins that promote activity of enzymes at various stages in the chemical breakdown catabolism of nutrients to release energy vitamin b thiamine this vitamin is present in nuts yeast egg yolk liver legumes meat and the germ of cereals it is rapidly destroyed by heat the daily requirement is 08 to 1 mg and the body stores only about 30 mg thiamine is essential for the complete aerobic release of energy from carbohydrate when it is absent there is accumulation of lactic and pyruvic acids which may lead to accumulation of tissue fluid oedema and heart failure thiamine is also important for nervous system function because of the dependency of these tissues on glucose for fuel deficiency causes beriberi which occurs mainly in countries where polished rice is the chief constituent of the diet in beriberi there is severe muscle wasting stunted growth in children polyneuritis causing degeneration of motor sensory and some autonomic nerves susceptibility to infections if untreated death occurs due to cardiac failure or severe microbial infection the main cause of thiamine deficiency in developed countries is chronic alcohol abuse where the diet is usually poor neurological symptoms include memory loss ataxia and visual disturbances sometimes these are reversed with oral thiamine supplements vitamin b2 riboflavine riboflavine is found in yeast green vegetables milk liver eggs cheese and fish roe the daily requirement is 11 to 13 mg and only small amounts are stored in the body it is concerned with carbohydrate and protein metabolism especially in the eyes and skin deficiency leads to blurred vision cataract formation and corneal ulceration cracking of the skin commonly around the mouth angular stomatitis lesions of intestinal mucosa folic acid this is found in liver kidney fresh leafy green vegetables and yeast it is synthesised by bacteria in the large intestine and significant amounts derived from this source are believed to be absorbed the daily requirement is 200 ug and as only a small amount is stored in the body deficiency is evident within a short time it is essential for dna synthesis and when lacking mitosis cell division is impaired this manifests particularly in rapidly dividing tissues such as blood and folate deficiency therefore leads to a type of megaloblastic anaemia p 70 which is reversible with folate supplements deficiency at conception and during early pregnancy is linked to an increased incidence of spina bifida p 189 niacin nicotinic acid this is found in liver cheese yeast whole cereals eggs fish and nuts in addition the body can synthesise it from the amino acid tryptophan it is associated with energyreleasing reactions in cells in fat metabolism it inhibits the production of cholesterol and assists in fat breakdown deficiency occurs mainly in areas where maize is the chief constituent of the diet because niacin in maize is in an unusable form the daily requirement is 12 to 17 mg pellagra develops within 6 to 8 weeks of severe deficiency it is characterised by redness of the skin in parts exposed to light especially in the neck anorexia nausea dysphagia and inflammation of the lining of the mouth delirium mental disturbance and dementia vitamin b6 pyridoxine this is found in egg yolk peas beans soya beans yeast meat and liver the daily requirement is about 12 to 14 mg and dietary deficiency is rare although certain drugs eg alcohol and antituberculous drugs antagonise the vitamin and can induce deficiency states it is associated with amino acid metabolism including the synthesis of nonessential amino acids and molecules such as haem and nucleic acids vitamin b12 cyanocobalamin vitamin b12 consists of a number of cobalamin compounds containing cobalt it is found in liver meat eggs milk and fermented liquors the normal daily requirement is 15 ug like folic acid vitamin b12 is essential for dna synthesis and deficiency also leads to a megaloblastic anaemia which is correctable with supplements however vitamin b12 is also required for formation and maintenance of myelin the fatty substance that surrounds and protects some nerves deficiency accordingly causes peripheral neuropathy andor spinal cord degeneration such neurological changes are irreversible the presence of intrinsic factor in the stomach is essential for vitamin b12 absorption and deficiency is usually associated with insufficient intrinsic factor p 70 pantothenic acid this is found in many foods and is associated with amino acid metabolism the daily safe intake is 3 to 7 mg and no deficiency diseases have been identified biotin this is found in yeast egg yolk liver kidney and tomatoes and is synthesised by microbes in the intestine it is associated with the metabolism of carbohydrates the daily safe intake is 10 to 200 jig deficiency is rare vitamin c ascorbic acid this is found in fresh fruit especially blackcurrants oranges grapefruit and lemons and also in rosehips and green vegetables the vitamin is very soluble in water and is easily destroyed by heat so cooking may be a factor in the development of scurvy the daily requirement is 40 mg and after 2 to 3 months deficient intake becomes apparent vitamin c is associated with protein metabolism especially the laying down of collagen fibres in connective tissue vitamin c like vitamin e acts as an antioxidant protecting body molecules from damaging oxidative reactions when deficiency occurs collagen production is affected leading to fragility of blood vessels delayed wound healing and poor bone repair gums become swollen and spongy and the teeth loosen in their sockets,vitamins are essential chemical compounds required in small amounts for metabolism and overall health they are divided into fatsoluble a d e k and watersoluble vitamins b complex c fatsoluble vitamins vitamin a supports vision immunity and cellular growth deficiency causes night blindness and immune issues vitamin d aids calcium and phosphate absorption essential for bone health deficiency leads to rickets and osteomalacia vitamin e protects cells from oxidative damage deficiency is rare but can cause anaemia and immune deficiencies vitamin k is crucial for blood clotting synthesized in the intestines deficiency impacts clotting watersoluble vitamins vitamin b complex includes several b vitamins that support energy release and nervous system health for example thiamine is vital for carbohydrate metabolism deficiency can lead to beriberi vitamin b12 and folic acid are essential for dna synthesis with deficiencies causing anaemia and nervous system disorders vitamin c supports collagen formation and wound healing deficiency results in scurvy which affects blood vessel integrity and bone repair
mineral salts mineral salts inorganic compounds are necessary within the body for all body processes usually in only small quantities calcium this is found in milk cheese eggs green vegetables and some fish an adequate supply should be obtained in a normal wellbalanced diet although requirements are higher in pregnant women and growing children 99 of body calcium is found in the bones where it is an essential structural component calcium is also involved in the coagulation of blood and the mechanism of muscle contraction phosphate sources of phosphate include cheese oatmeal liver and kidney if there is sufficient calcium in the diet it is unlikely that there will be a phosphate deficiency it is associated with calcium and vitamin d in the hardening of bones and teeth 85 of body phosphate is found in these sites phosphates are an essential part of systems of energy storage inside cells as adenosine triphosphate atp fig 212 p 25 sodium sodium is found in most foods especially fish meat eggs milk artificially enriched bread and as cooking and table salt the normal intake of sodium chloride per day varies from 5 to 20 g and the daily requirement is 16 g excess is excreted in the urine it is the most commonly occurring extracellular cation and is associated with contraction of muscles transmission of nerve impulses along axons maintenance of the electrolyte balance in the body potassium this substance is to be found widely distributed in all foods especially fruit and vegetables the normal intake of potassium chloride is 35 g per day and this is in excess of potassium requirements it is the most commonly occurring intracellular cation and is involved in many chemical activities inside cells including contraction of muscles transmission of nerve impulses maintenance of the electrolyte balance in the body iron iron as a soluble compound is found in liver kidney beef egg yolk wholemeal bread and green vegetables in normal adults about 1 mg of iron is lost from the body daily the normal daily diet contains more ie 9 to 15 mg but only 515 of intake is absorbed iron is essential for the formation of haemoglobin in the red blood cells it is also necessary for oxidation of carbohydrate and in the synthesis of some hormones and neurotransmitters iron deficiency is a relatively common condition and causes anaemia if iron stores become sufficiently depleted menstruating and pregnant women have increased iron requirements as do young people experiencing growth spurts iron deficiency anaemia may also occur in chronic bleeding eg peptic ulcer disease iodine iodine is found in saltwater fish and in vegetables grown in soil containing iodine in some parts of the world where iodine is deficient in soil very small quantities are added to table salt the daily requirement of iodine depends upon the individuals metabolic rate some people have a higher normal metabolic rate than others and their iodine requirements are greater the daily requirement is 140 ug it is essential for the formation of thyroxine and triiodothyronine two hormones secreted by the thyroid gland p 220 fibre fibre is the indigestible part of the diet that comes from plants and meat it consists of bran cellulose and other polysaccharides it is widely distributed in wholemeal flour the husks of cereals and in vegetables dietary fibre is partly digested by microbes in the large intestine with gas flatus formation the daily requirement of fibre is not less than 20 g functions of dietary fibre fibre provides bulk to the diet and helps to satisfy the appetite stimulates peristalsis muscular activity of the alimentary tract attracts water increasing bulk and softness of faeces increases frequency of defecation preventing constipation prevents some gastrointestinal disorders eg diverticular disease p 328 water water makes up about 70 of the body weight in men and about 60 in women a man weighing 65 kg contains about 40 litres of water 28 of which are intracellular and 12 extracellular extracellular water consists of 2 to 3 litres in plasma and the remainder interstitial fluid see fig 216 p 28 a large amount of water is lost each day in faeces sweat and urine under normal circumstances this is balanced by intake in food and to satisfy thirst dehydration with serious consequences may occur if intake does not balance loss functions of water these include provision of the moist internal environment which is required by all living cells in the body ie all the cells except the superficial layers of the skin the nails the hair and outer hard layer of the teeth participation in all the chemical reactions which occur inside and outside the body cells dilution and moistening of food see saliva p 292 regulation of body temperature as a constituent of sweat which is secreted onto the skin it evaporates cooling the body surface p 365 a major constituent of blood and tissue fluid it transports some substances in solution and some in suspension round the body dilution of waste products and poisonous substances in the body providing the medium for the excretion of waste products eg urine and faeces,mineral salts are inorganic compounds essential in small amounts for various body functions calcium found in dairy and vegetables vital for bones blood clotting and muscle function most body calcium is in bones phosphate present in cheese and meats works with calcium and vitamin d to harden bones and teeth critical for atp in cells sodium commonly from salt and enriched foods necessary for muscle contraction nerve transmission and electrolyte balance potassium found in fruits and vegetables supports muscle function nerve signaling and cellular electrolyte balance iron in red meats and greens needed for hemoglobin in red blood cells and cellular energy deficiency leads to anemia iodine in saltwater fish and iodized salt required for thyroid hormone production essential for metabolic regulation fibre a plantbased part of the diet that aids digestion attracts water to soften waste and prevents constipation water comprising 6070 of body weight water maintains cellular environments regulates temperature and assists in waste excretion
the digestive system the digestive system is the collective name used to describe the alimentary canal some accessory organs and a variety of digestive processes which take place at different levels in the canal to prepare food eaten in the diet for absorption the alimentary canal begins at the mouth passes through the thorax abdomen and pelvis and ends at the anus fig 121 it has a general structure which is modified at different levels to provide for the processes occurring at each level fig 122 the complex of digestive processes gradually breaks down the foods eaten until they are in a form suitable for absorption for example meat even when cooked is chemically too complex to be absorbed from the alimentary canal it therefore goes through a series of changes which release its constituent nutrients amino acids mineral salts fat and vitamins chemical substances or enzymes p 26 which effect these changes are secreted into the canal by specialised glands some of which are in the walls of the canal and some outside the canal but with ducts leading into it after absorption nutrients are used to synthesise body constituents they provide the raw materials for the manufacture of new cells hormones and enzymes and the energy needed for these and other processes and for the disposal of waste materials the activities in the digestive system can be grouped under five main headings i ngestion this is the process of taking food into the alimentary tract propulsion this moves the contents along the alimentary tract digestion this consists of mechanical breakdown of food by eg mastication chewing chemical digestion of food by enzymes present in secretions produced by glands and accessory organs of the digestive system absorption this is the process by which digested food substances pass through the walls of some organs of the alimentary canal into the blood and lymph capillaries for circulation round the body elimination food substances which have been eaten but cannot be digested and absorbed are excreted by the bowel as faeces organs of the digestive system alimentary tract this is a long tube through which food passes it commences at the mouth and terminates at the anus and the various parts are given separate names although structurally they are remarkably similar the parts are mouth pharynx oesophagus stomach small intestine large intestine rectum and anal canal accessory organs various secretions are poured into the alimentary tract some by glands in the lining membrane of the organs eg gastric juice secreted by glands in the lining of the stomach and some by glands situated outside the tract the latter are the accessory organs of digestion and their secretions pass through ducts to enter the tract they consist of 3 pairs of salivary glands pancreas liver and the biliary tract the organs and glands are linked physiologically as well as anatomically in that digestion and absorption occur in stages each stage being dependent upon the previous stage or stages basic structure of the alimentary canal the layers of the walls of the alimentary canal follow a consistent pattern from the oesophagus onwards this basic structure does not apply so obviously to the mouth and the pharynx which are considered later in the chapter in the different organs from the oesophagus onwards modifications of structure are found which are associated with special functions the basic structure is described here and any modifications in structure and function are described in the appropriate section the walls of the alimentary tract are formed by four layers of tissue adventitia or outer covering muscle layer submucosal layer mucosa lining adventitia outer covering in the thorax this consists of loose fibrous tissue and in the abdomen the organs are covered by a serous membrane called peritoneum peritoneum the peritoneum is the largest serous membrane of the body fig 123a it consists of a closed sac containing a small amount of serous fluid within the abdominal cavity it is richly supplied with blood and lymph vessels and contains a considerable number of lymph nodes it provides a physical barrier to local spread of infection and can isolate an infective focus such as appendicitis preventing involvement of other abdominal structures it has two layers the parietal layer which lines the abdominal wall the visceral layer which covers the organs viscera within the abdominal and pelvic cavities the arrangement of the peritoneum is such that the organs are invaginated into the closed sac from below behind and above so that they are at least partly covered by the visceral layer this means that pelvic organs are covered only on their superior surface the stomach and intestines deeply invaginated from behind are almost completely surrounded by peritoneum and have a double fold the mesentery that attaches them to the posterior abdominal wall the fold of peritoneum enclosing the stomach extends beyond the greater curvature of the stomach and hangs down in front of the abdominal organs like an apron fig 123b this is the greater omentum and it stores fat which provides both insulation and a longterm energy store the pancreas spleen kidneys and adrenal glands are invaginated from behind but only their anterior surfaces are covered and are therefore retroperitoneal the liver is invaginated from above and is almost completely covered by peritoneum which attaches it to the inferior surface of the diaphragm the main blood vessels and nerves pass close to the posterior abdominal wall and send branches to the organs between folds of peritoneum the parietal peritoneum lines the anterior abdominal wall the two layers of peritoneum are actually in contact and friction between them is prevented by the presence of serous fluid secreted by the peritoneal cells thus the peritoneal cavity is only a potential cavity a similar arrangement is seen with the membranes covering the lungs the pleura p 251 in the male it is completely closed but in the female the uterine tubes open into it and the ovaries are the only structures inside ch 19 muscle layer with some exceptions this consists of two layers of smooth involuntary muscle the muscle fibres of the outer layer are arranged longitudinally and those of the inner layer encircle the wall of the tube between these two muscle layers are blood vessels lymph vessels and a plexus network of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves called the myenteric or auerbachs plexus these nerves supply the adjacent smooth muscle and blood vessels contraction and relaxation of these muscle layers occurs in waves which push the contents of the tract onwards this type of contraction of smooth muscle is called peristalsis fig 124 muscle contraction also mixes food with the digestive juices onward movement of the contents of the tract is controlled at various points by sphincters consisting of an increased number of circular muscle fibres they also act as valves preventing backflow in the tract the control allows time for digestion and absorption to take place submucosa this layer consists of loose connective tissue with some elastic fibres within this layer are plexuses of blood vessels and nerves lymph vessels and varying amounts of lymphoid tissues the blood vessels consist of arterioles venules and capillaries the nerve plexus is the submucosal or meissners plexus consisting of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves which supply the mucosal lining mucosa this consists of three layers of tissue mucous membrane formed by columnar epithelium is the innermost layer and has three main functions protection secretion and absorption lamina propria consisting of loose connective tissue which supports the blood vessels that nourish the inner epithelial layer and varying amounts of lymphoid tissue that has a protective function muscularis mucosa a thin outer layer of smooth muscle that provides involutions of the mucosa layer eg gastric glands villi mucous membrane in parts of the tract which are subject to great wear and tear or mechanical injury this layer consists of stratified squamous epithelium with mucussecreting glands just below the surface in areas where the food is already soft and moist and where secretion of digestive juices and absorption occur the mucous membrane consists of columnar epithelial cells interspersed with mucussecreting goblet cells fig 125 mucus lubricates the walls of the tract and protects them from digestive enzymes below the surface in the regions lined with columnar epithelium are collections of specialised cells or glands which pour their secretions into the lumen of the tract the secretions include saliva from the salivary glands gastric juice from the gastric glands intestinal juice from the intestinal glands pancreatic juice from the pancreas bile from the liver these are digestive juices and they contain the enzymes which chemically break down food under the epithelial lining are varying amounts of lymphoid tissue,the digestive system consists of the alimentary canal and accessory organs which work together to break down food for nutrient absorption the alimentary canal a continuous tube from the mouth to the anus is modified at different levels to support various digestive processes including ingestion propulsion digestion absorption and elimination key processes ingestion taking in food propulsion moving food through the canal digestion mechanical and chemical breakdown primarily by enzymes from glands absorption movement of nutrients into the blood and lymph elimination removal of undigested food as feces alimentary canal components mouth pharynx esophagus stomach small intestine large intestine rectum and anal canal accessory organs salivary glands pancreas liver and biliary tract which secrete enzymes for digestion the canal has four primary tissue layers adventitia outer covering becomes the peritoneum in the abdomen muscle layer creates peristalsis to move food submucosa contains blood vessels nerves and lymph tissue mucosa innermost lining for protection secretion and absorption peritoneum a doublelayered serous membrane in the abdomen that covers and supports digestive organs
mouth the mouth or oral cavity is bounded by muscles and bones anteriorly by the lips posteriorly it is continuous with the oropharynx laterally by the muscles of the cheeks superiorly by the bony hard palate and muscular soft palate inferiorly by the muscular tongue and the soft tissues of the floor of the mouth the oral cavity is lined throughout with mucous membrane consisting of stratified squamous epithelium containing small mucussecreting glands the part of the mouth between the gums alveolar ridges and the cheeks is the vestibule and the remainder of the cavity is the mouth proper the mucous membrane lining of the cheeks and the lips is reflected on to the gums or alveolar ridges and is continuous with the skin of the face the palate forms the roof of the mouth and is divided into the anterior hard palate and the posterior soft palate fig 121 the bones forming the hard palate are the maxilla and the palatine bones the soft palate is muscular curves downwards from the posterior end of the hard palate and blends with the walls of the pharynx at the sides the uvula is a curved fold of muscle covered with mucous membrane hanging down from the middle of the free border of the soft palate originating from the upper end of the uvula there are four folds of mucous membrane two passing downwards at each side to form membranous arches the posterior folds one on each side are the palatopharyngeal arches and the two anterior folds are the palatoglossal arches on each side between the arches is a collection of lymphoid tissue called the palatine tonsil tongue the tongue is a voluntary muscular structure which occupies the floor of the mouth it is attached by its base to the hyoid bone see fig 104 p 242 and by a fold of its mucous membrane covering called the frenulum to the floor of the mouth fig 1211 the superior surface consists of stratified squamous epithelium with numerous papillae little projections containing nerve endings of the sense of taste sometimes called the taste buds there are three varieties of papillae fig 1212 vallate papillae usually between 8 and 12 altogether are arranged in an inverted v shape towards the base of the tongue these are the largest of the papillae and are the most easily seen fungiform papillae are situated mainly at the tip and the edges of the tongue and are more numerous than the vallate papillae filiform papillae are the smallest of the three types they are most numerous on the surface of the anterior twothirds of the tongue blood supply the main arterial blood supply to the tongue is by the lingual branch of the external carotid artery venous drainage is by the lingual vein which joins the internal jugular vein nerve supply the nerves involved are the hypoglossal nerves 12th cranial nerves which supply the voluntary muscle tissue the lingual branch of the mandibular nerves which are the nerves of somatic ordinary sensation ie pain temperature and touch the facial and glossophanryngeal nerves 7th and 9th cranial nerves which are the nerves of the special sensation of taste functions of the tongue the tongue plays an important part in mastication chewing deglutition swallowing speech p 245 taste p 207 nerve endings of the sense of taste are present in the papillae and widely distributed in the epithelium of the tongue soft palate pharynx and epiglottis teeth the teeth are embedded in the alveoli or sockets of the alveolar ridges of the mandible and the maxilla fig 1213 each individual has two sets or dentitions the temporary or deciduous teeth and the permanent teeth figs 1214 and 1215 at birth the teeth of both dentitions are present in immature form in the mandible and maxilla there are 20 temporary teeth 10 in each jaw they begin to erupt when the child is about 6 months old and should all be present after 24 months table 121 the permanent teeth begin to replace the deciduous teeth in the 6th year of age and this dentition consisting of 32 teeth is usually complete by the 24th year functions of the teeth the incisor and canine teeth are the cutting teeth and are used for biting off pieces of food whereas the premolar and molar teeth with broad flat surfaces are used for grinding or chewing food fig 1216 structure of a tooth fig 1217 although the shapes of the different teeth vary the structure is the same and consists of the crown the part which protrudes from the gum the root the part embedded in the bone the neck the slightly narrowed region where the crown merges with the root in the centre of the tooth is the pulp cavity containing blood vessels lymph vessels and nerves and surrounding this is a hard ivorylike substance called dentine outside the dentine of the crown is a thin layer of very hard substance the enamel the root of the tooth on the other hand is covered with a substance resembling bone called cement which fixes the tooth in its socket blood vessels and nerves pass to the tooth through a small foramen at the apex of each root blood supply most of the arterial blood supply to the teeth is by branches of the maxillary arteries the venous drainage is by a number of veins which empty into the internal jugular veins nerve supply the nerve supply to the upper teeth is by branches of the maxillary nerves and to the lower teeth by branches of the mandibular nerves these are both branches of the trigeminal nerves 5th cranial nerves see p 166,the mouth or oral cavity is enclosed by muscles and bones lined with a mucous membrane for protection and moisture it is divided into the vestibule space between cheeks and gums and the mouth proper the palate forms its roof with the hard palate in front and the soft palate including the uvula at the back tongue a muscular organ aiding in chewing swallowing speech and taste it is connected to the floor of the mouth by the frenulum and covered with tastesensitive papillae blood is supplied by the lingual artery and it receives sensory and motor signals from several cranial nerves teeth anchored in jaw sockets they consist of incisors and canines cutting and premolars and molars grinding each tooth has a crown above the gum root embedded in bone and neck blood vessels and nerves enter through the root apex ensuring nourishment and sensation key functions chewing taste and speech
salivary glands salivary glands pour their secretions into the mouth there are three pairs the parotid glands the submandibular glands and the sublingual glands parotid glands these are situated one on each side of the face just below the external acoustic meatus see fig 81 p 192 each gland has a parotid duct opening into the mouth at the level of the second upper molar tooth submandibular glands these lie one on each side of the face under the angle of the jaw the two submandibular ducts open on the floor of the mouth one on each side of the frenulum of the tongue sublingual glands these glands lie under the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth in front of the submandibular glands they have numerous small ducts that open into the floor of the mouth structure of the salivary glands the glands are all surrounded by a fibrous capsule they consist of a number of lobules made up of small acini lined with secretory cells fig 1218b the secretions are poured into ductules which join up to form larger ducts leading into the mouth nerve supply the glands are supplied by parasympathetic and sympathetic nerve fibres parasympathetic stimulation increases secretion whereas sympathetic stimulation decreases it blood supply arterial supply is by various branches from the external carotid arteries and venous drainage is into the external jugular veins composition of saliva saliva is the combined secretions from the salivary glands and the small mucussecreting glands of the lining of the oral cavity about 15 litres of saliva is produced daily and it consists of water mineral salts enzyme salivary amylase mucus lysozyme immunoglobulins bloodclotting factors secretion of saliva secretion of saliva is under autonomic nerve control parasympathetic stimulation causes vasodilatation and profuse secretion of watery saliva with a relatively low content of enzymes and other organic substances sympathetic stimulation causes vasoconstriction and secretion of small amounts of saliva rich in organic material especially from the submandibular glands reflex secretion occurs when there is food in the mouth and the reflex can easily become conditioned so that the sight smell and even the thought of food stimulates the flow of saliva functions of saliva chemical digestion of polysaccharides saliva contains the enzyme amylase that begins the breakdown of complex sugars reducing them to the disaccharide maltose the optimum ph for the action of salivary amylase is 68 slightly acid salivary ph ranges from 58 to 74 depending on the rate of flow the higher the flow rate the higher is the ph enzyme action continues during swallowing until terminated by the strongly acidic ph 15 to 18 of the gastric juices which degrades the amylase lubrication of food dry food entering the mouth is moistened and lubricated by saliva before it can be made into a bolus ready for swallowing cleansing and lubricating an adequate flow of saliva is necessary to cleanse the mouth and keep its tissues soft moist and pliable it helps to prevent damage to the mucous membrane by rough or abrasive foodstuffs nonspecific defence lysozyme immunoglobulins and clotting factors combat invading microbes taste the taste buds are stimulated only by chemical substances in solution dry foods stimulate the sense of taste only after thorough mixing with saliva the senses of taste and smell are closely linked in the enjoyment or otherwise of food pharynx the pharynx is divided for descriptive purpose into three parts the nasopharynx oropharynx and laryngopharynx see p 243 the nasopharynx is important in respiration the oropharynx and laryngopharynx are passages common to both the respiratory and the digestive systems food passes from the oral cavity into the pharynx then to the oesophagus below with which it is continuous the walls of the pharynx are built of three layers of tissue the lining membrane mucosa is stratified squamous epithelium continuous with the lining of the mouth at one end and with the oesophagus at the other the middle layer consists of fibrous tissue which becomes thinner towards the lower end and contains blood and lymph vessels and nerves the outer layer consists of a number of involuntary constrictor muscles which are involved in swallowing when food reaches the pharynx swallowing is no longer under voluntary control blood supply the blood supply to the pharynx is by several branches of the facial arteries venous drainage is into the facial veins and the internal jugular veins nerve supply this is from the pharyngeal plexus and consists of parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves parasympathetic supply is mainly by the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves and sympathetic from the cervical ganglia oesophagus the oesophagus is about 25 cm long and about 2 cm in diameter and lies in the median plane in the thorax in front of the vertebral column behind the trachea and the heart it is continuous with the pharynx above and just below the diaphragm it joins the stomach it passes between muscle fibres of the diaphragm behind the central tendon at the level of the 10th thoracic vertebra immediately the oesophagus has passed through the diaphragm it curves upwards before opening into the stomach this sharp angle is believed to be one of the factors which prevents the regurgitation backward flow of gastric contents into the oesophagus the upper and lower ends of the oesophagus are closed by sphincter muscles the upper cricopharyngeal sphincter prevents air passing into the oesophagus during inspiration and the aspiration of oesophageal contents the cardiac or lower oesophageal sphincter prevents the reflux of acid gastric contents into the oesophagus there is no thickening of the circular muscle in this area and this sphincter is therefore physiological ie this region can act as a sphincter without the presence of the anatomical features when intraabdominal pressure is raised eg during inspiration and defaecation the tone of the lower sphincter muscle increases there is an added pinching effect by the contracting muscle fibres of the diaphragm structure there are four layers of tissue as shown in figure 122 as the oesophagus is almost entirely in the thorax the outer covering the adventitia consists of elastic fibrous tissue the proximal third is lined by stratified squamous epithelium and the distal third by columnar epithelium the middle third is lined by a mixture of the two blood supply arterial the thoracic region of the oesophagus is supplied mainly by the oesophageal arteries branches from the aorta the abdominal region is supplied by branches from the inferior phrenic arteries and the left gastric branch of the coeliac artery venous drainage from the thoracic region venous drainage is into the azygos and hemiazygos veins the abdominal part drains into the left gastric vein there is a venous plexus at the distal end that links the upward and downward venous drainage ie the general and portal nerve supply sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves terminate in the myenteric and submucosal plexuses parasympathetic fibres are branches of the vagus nerves fig 126 functions of the mouth pharynx and oesophagus formation of a bolus when food is taken into the mouth it is masticated or chewed by the teeth and moved round the mouth by the tongue and muscles of the cheeks fig 1220 it is mixed with saliva and formed into a soft mass or bolus ready for deglutition or swallowing the length of time that food remains in the mouth depends to a large extent on the consistency of the food some foods need to the chewed longer than others before the individual feels that the mass is ready for swallowing deglutition or swallowing fig 1221 this occurs in three stages after mastication is complete and the bolus has been formed it is initiated voluntarily but completed by a reflex involuntary action 1 the mouth is closed and the voluntary muscles of the tongue and cheeks push the bolus backwards into the pharynx 2 the muscles of the pharynx are stimulated by a reflex action initiated in the walls of the oropharynx and coordinated in the medulla and lower pons in the brain stem contraction of these muscles propels the bolus down into the oesophagus all other routes that the bolus could possibly take are closed the soft palate rises up and closes off the nasopharynx the tongue and the pharyngeal folds block the way back into the mouth and the larynx is lifted up and forward so that its opening is occluded by the overhanging epiglottis preventing entry into the airway 3 the presence of the bolus in the pharynx stimulates a wave of peristalsis which propels the bolus through the oesophagus to the stomach peristaltic waves pass along the oesophagus only after swallowing fig 124 otherwise the walls are relaxed ahead of a peristaltic wave the cardiac sphincter guarding the entrance to the stomach relaxes to allow the descending bolus to pass into the stomach usually constriction of the cardiac sphincter prevents reflux of gastric acid into the oesophagus other factors preventing gastric reflux include the attachment of the stomach to the diaphragm by the peritoneum the maintenance of an acute angle between the oesophagus and the fundus of the stomach ie an acute cardiooesophageal angle increased tone of the cardiac sphincter when intraabdominal pressure is increased and the pinching effect of diaphragm muscle fibres the walls of the oesophagus are lubricated by mucus which assists the passage of the bolus during the peristaltic contraction of the muscular wall,the salivary glands consisting of parotid submandibular and sublingual glands release saliva into the mouth through ducts playing key roles in digestion protection and lubrication saliva a fluid secreted by these glands is made up of water enzymes salivary amylase mucus lysozyme and immunoglobulins which together assist in food breakdown pathogen defense and maintaining oral moisture its secretion is regulated by autonomic nerves parasympathetic stimulation produces a watery saliva aiding digestion while sympathetic stimulation results in a thicker saliva with higher organic content primarily from the submandibular glands the pharynx a shared structure for the respiratory and digestive systems is divided into the nasopharynx oropharynx and laryngopharynx it receives chewed food bolus from the mouth initiating the swallowing process or deglutition the esophagus a 25 cm muscular tube connects the pharynx to the stomach and has sphincters at both ends the upper cricopharyngeal sphincter blocks air entry while the cardiac sphincter prevents gastric acid reflux swallowing occurs in three stages voluntary movement of the bolus into the pharynx reflex action moving it to the esophagus and a peristaltic wave pushing it toward the stomach facilitated by mucosal lubrication and coordinated muscle contractions
stomach the stomach is a jshaped dilated portion of the alimentary tract situated in the epigastric umbilical and left hypochondriac regions of the abdominal cavity organs associated with the stomach fig 1222 anteriorly left lobe of liver and anterior abdominal wall posteriorly abdominal aorta pancreas spleen left kidney and adrenal gland superiorly diaphragm oesophagus and left lobe of liver inferiorly transverse colon and small intestine to the left diaphragm and spleen to the rightliver and duodenum structure of the stomach fig 1223 the stomach is continuous with the oesophagus at the cardiac sphincter and with the duodenum at the pyloric sphincter it has two curvatures the lesser curvature is short lies on the posterior surface of the stomach and is the downwards continuation of the posterior wall of the oesophagus just before the pyloric sphincter it curves upwards to complete the j shape where the oesophagus joins the stomach the anterior region angles acutely upwards curves downwards forming the greater curvature then slightly upwards towards the pyloric sphincter the stomach is divided into three regions the fundus the body and the antrum at the distal end of the pyloric antrum is the pyloric sphincter guarding the opening between the stomach and the duodenum when the stomach is inactive the pyloric sphincter is relaxed and open and when the stomach contains food the sphincter is closed walls of the stomach the four layers of tissue that comprise the basic structure of the alimentary canal fig 122 are found in the stomach but with some modifications muscle layer fig 1224 this consists of three layers of smooth muscle fibres an outer layer of longitudinal fibres a middle layer of circular fibres an inner layer of oblique fibres in this respect the stomach is different from other regions of the alimentary tract as it has three layers of muscle instead of two fig 122 this arrangement allows for the churning motion characteristic of gastric activity as well as peristaltic movement circular muscle is strongest in the pyloric antrum and sphincter mucosa when the stomach is empty the mucous membrane lining is thrown into longitudinal folds or rugae and when full the rugae are ironed out and the surface has a smooth velvety appearance numerous gastric glands are situated below the surface in the mucous membrane they consist of specialised cells that secrete gastric juice into the stomach blood supply arterial blood is supplied to the stomach by branches of the coeliac artery and venous drainage is into the portal vein figures 127 and 129 give details of the names of these vessels nerve supply the sympathetic supply to the stomach is mainly from the coeliac plexus and the parasympathetic supply is from the vagus nerves sympathetic stimulation reduces the motility of the stomach and the secretion of gastric juice vagal stimulation has the opposite effect fig 126 gastric juice and functions of the stomach stomach size varies with the volume of food it contains which may be 15 litres or more in an adult when a meal has been eaten the food accumulates in the stomach in layers the last part of the meal remaining in the fundus for some time mixing with the gastric juice takes place gradually and it may be some time before the food is sufficiently acidified to stop the action of salivary amylase gastric muscle contraction consists of a churning movement that breaks down the bolus and mixes it with gastric juice and peristaltic waves that propel the stomach contents towards the pylorus when the stomach is active the pyloric sphincter closes strong peristaltic contraction of the pyloric antrum forces gastric contents after they are sufficiently liquefied through the pylorus into the duodenum in small spurts gastric juice about 2 litres of gastric juice are secreted daily by special secretory glands in the mucosa fig 1225 it consists of secreted by gastric glands water mineral salts mucus secreted by goblet cells in the glands and on the stomach surface hydrochloric acid secreted by parietal m intrinsic factor 1 cells in the gastric glands inactive enzyme precursors pepsinogens secreted by chief cells in the glands functions of gastric juice water further liquefies the food swallowed hydrochloric acid acidifies the food and stops the action of salivary amylase kills ingested microbes provides the acid environment needed for effective digestion by pepsins pepsinogens are activated to pepsins by hydrochloric acid and by pepsins already present in the stomach they begin the digestion of proteins breaking them into smaller molecules pepsins act most effectively at ph 15 to 35 intrinsic factor a protein is necessary for the absorption of vitamin b12 from the ileum mucus prevents mechanical injury to the stomach wall by lubricating the contents it prevents chemical injury by acting as a barrier between the stomach wall and the corrosive gastric juice hydrochloric acid is present in potentially damaging concentrations and pepsins digest protein secretion of gastric juice there is always a small quantity of gastric juice present in the stomach even when it contains no food this is known as fasting juice secretion reaches its maximum level about 1 hour after a meal then declines to the fasting level after about 4 hours there are three phases of secretion of gastric juice fig 1226 1 cephalic phase this flow of juice occurs before food reaches the stomach and is due to reflex stimulation of the vagus nerves initiated by the sight smell or taste of food when the vagus nerves have been cut vagotomy this phase of gastric secretion stops 2 gastric phase when stimulated by the presence of food the enteroendocrine cells in the pyloric antrum and duodenum secrete gastrin a hormone which passes directly into the circulating blood gastrin circulating in the blood which supplies the stomach stimulates the gastric glands to produce more gastric juice in this way the secretion of digestive juice is continued after the completion of the meal and the end of the cephalic phase gastrin secretion is suppressed when the ph in the pyloric antrum falls to about 15 3 intestinal phase when the partially digested contents of the stomach reach the small intestine a hormone complex enterogastrone is produced by endocrine cells in the intestinal mucosa which slows down the secretion of gastric juice and reduces gastric motility two of the hormones forming this complex are secretin and cholecystokinin cck by slowing the emptying rate of the stomach the contents of the duodenum become more thoroughly mixed with bile and pancreatic juice this phase of gastric secretion is most marked when the meal has had a high fat content the rate at which the stomach empties depends to a large extent on the type of food eaten a carbohydrate meal leaves the stomach in 2 to 3 hours a protein meal remains longer and a fatty meal remains in the stomach longest functions of the stomach these include temporary storage allowing time for the digestive enzymes pepsins to act chemical digestion pepsins convert proteins to polypeptides mechanical breakdown the three smooth muscle layers enable the stomach to act as a churn gastric juice is added and the contents are liquefied to chyme limited absorption of water alcohol and some lipidsoluble drugs nonspecific defence against microbes provided by hydrochloric acid in gastric juice vomiting may be a response to ingestion of gastric irritants eg microbes or chemicals preparation of iron for absorption further along the tract the acid environment of the stomach solubilises iron salts which is required before iron can be absorbed production of intrinsic factor needed for absorption of vitamin b12 in the terminal ileum regulation of the passage of gastric contents into the duodenum when the chyme is sufficiently acidified and liquefied the pyloric antrum forces small jets of gastric contents through the pyloric sphincter into the duodenum,the stomach a jshaped organ in the upper abdomen functions as a site for food storage digestion and defense its structure includes distinct regionsthe fundus body and antrumand is connected to the esophagus by the cardiac sphincter and to the duodenum by the pyloric sphincter the stomachs muscle layer unique with three layers of fibers longitudinal circular and oblique enables both churning and peristalsis to thoroughly mix food with gastric juice gastric juice produced by specialized gastric glands includes water hydrochloric acid mucus pepsinogen inactive enzyme and intrinsic factor this acidic environment serves multiple roles it halts salivary digestion kills pathogens activates pepsin for protein digestion and prepares iron for absorption intrinsic factor is also crucial for absorbing vitamin b12 in the intestine gastric juice secretion occurs in three phases the cephalic phase triggered by food sightsmell gastric phase triggered by food in the stomach and intestinal phase which slows secretion as food enters the intestine main functions include breaking down food mechanically and chemically limited absorption of water and alcohol preparing iron for absorption and regulating chyme release into the duodenum
small intestine the small intestine is continuous with the stomach at the pyloric sphincter and leads into the large intestine at the ileocaecal valve it is a little over 5 metres long and lies in the abdominal cavity surrounded by the large intestine in the small intestine the chemical digestion of food is completed and most of the absorption of nutrients takes place the small intestine comprises three main sections continuous with each other the duodenum is about 25 cm long and curves around the head of the pancreas secretions from the gall bladder and pancreas are released into the duodenum through a common structure the hepatopancreatic ampulla and the opening into the duodenum is guarded by the hepatopancreatic sphincter of oddi fig 1242 the jejunum is the middle section of the small intestine and is about 2 metres long the ileum or terminal section is about 3 metres long and ends at the ileocaecal valve which controls the flow of material from the ileum to the caecum the first part of the large intestine and prevents regurgitation structure of the small intestine the walls of the small intestine are composed of the four layers of tissue shown in figure 122 some modifications of the peritoneum and mucosa mucous membrane lining are described below peritoneum a double layer of peritoneum called the mesentery attaches the jejunum and ileum to the posterior abdominal wall fig 123a the attachment is quite short in comparison with the length of the small intestine therefore it is fanshaped the large blood vessels and nerves lie on the posterior abdominal wall and the branches to the small intestine pass between the two layers of the mesentery mucosa the surface area of the small intestine mucosa is greatly increased by permanent circular folds villi and microvilli the permanent circular folds unlike the rugae of the stomach are not smoothed out when the small intestine is distended fig 1229 they promote mixing of chyme as it passes along the villi are tiny fingerlike projections of the mucosal layer into the intestinal lumen about 05 to 1 mm long fig 1230 their walls consist of columnar epithelial cells or enterocytes with tiny microvilli 1 m long on their free border goblet cells that secrete mucus are interspersed between the enterocytes these epithelial cells enclose a network of blood and lymph capillaries the lymph capillaries are called lacteals because absorbed fat gives the lymph a milky appearance absorption and some final stages of digestion of nutrients take place in the enterocytes before entering the blood and lymph capillaries the intestinal glands are simple tubular glands situated below the surface between the villi the cells of the glands migrate upwards to form the walls of the villi replacing those at the tips as they are rubbed off by the intestinal contents the entire epithelium is replaced every 3 to 5 days during migration the cells form digestive enzymes that lodge in the microvilli and together with intestinal juice complete the chemical digestion of carbohydrates protein and fats numerous lymph nodes are found in the mucosa at irregular intervals throughout the length of the small intestine the smaller ones are known as solitary lymphatic follicles and about 20 or 30 larger nodes situated towards the distal end of the ileum are called aggregated lymphatic follicles peyers patches these lymphatic tissues packed with defensive cells are strategically placed to neutralise ingested antigens ch 15 blood supply figs 128 and 129 the superior mesenteric artery supplies the whole of the small intestine and venous drainage is by the superior mesenteric vein which joins other veins to form the portal vein nerve supply innervation of the small intestine is both sympathetic and parasympathetic fig 126 intestinal juice about 1500 ml of intestinal juice are secreted daily by the glands of the small intestine it consists of water mucus mineral salts enzyme enterokinase enteropeptidases the ph of intestinal juice is usually between 78 and 80 functions of the small intestine the functions are onward movement of its contents which is produced by peristalsis secretion of intestinal juice completion of chemical digestion of carbohydrates protein and fats in the enterocytes of the villi protection against infection by microbes that have survived the antimicrobial action of the hydrochloric acid in the stomach by the solitary lymph follicles and aggregated lymph follicles secretion of the hormones cholecystokinin cck and secretin absorption of nutrients chemical digestion in the small intestine when acid chyme passes into the small intestine it is mixed with pancreatic juice bile and intestinal juice and is in contact with the enterocytes of the villi in the small intestine the digestion of all the nutrients is completed carbohydrates are broken down to monosaccharides proteins are broken down to amino acids fats are broken down to fatty acids and glycerol pancreatic juice pancreatic juice enters the duodenum at the hepatopancreatic ampulla and consists of water mineral salts enzymes amylase lipase inactive enzyme precursors trypsinogen chymotrypsinogen procarboxypeptidase pancreatic juice is alkaline ph 8 because it contains significant quantities of bicarbonate ions which are alkaline in solution when acid stomach contents enter the duodenum they are mixed with pancreatic juice and bile and the ph is raised to between 6 and 8 this is the ph at which the pancreatic enzymes amylase and lipase act most effectively functions digestion of proteins trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen are inactive enzyme precursors activated by enterokinase enteropeptidase an enzyme in the microvilli which converts them into the active proteolytic enzymes trypsin and chymotrypsin these enzymes convert polypeptides to tripeptides dipeptides and amino acids it is important that they are produced as inactive precursors and are activated only upon arrival in the duodenum otherwise they would digest the pancreas digestion of carbohydrates pancreatic amylase converts all digestible polysaccharides starches not acted upon by salivary amylase to disaccharides digestion of fats lipase converts fats to fatty acids and glycerol to aid the action of lipase bile salts emulsify fats ie reduce the size of the globules increasing their surface area control of secretion the secretion of pancreatic juice is stimulated by secretin and cck produced by endocrine cells in the walls of the duodenum the presence in the duodenum of acid material from the stomach stimulates the production of these hormones bile bile secreted by the liver is unable to enter the duodenum when the hepatopancreatic sphincter is closed therefore it passes from the hepatic duct along the cystic duct to the gall bladder where it is stored fig 1242 bile has a ph of 8 and between 500 and 1000 ml are secreted daily it consists of water mineral salts mucus bile salts bile pigments mainly bilirubin cholesterol functions the bile salts sodium taurocholate and sodium glycocholate emulsify fats in the small intestine the bile pigment bilirubin is a waste product of the breakdown of erythrocytes and is excreted in the bile rather than in the urine because of its low solubility in water bilirubin is altered by microbes in the large intestine some of the resultant urobilinogen which is highly water soluble is reabsorbed and then excreted in the urine but most is converted to stercobilin and excreted in the faeces fatty acids are insoluble in water which makes them very difficult to absorb through the intestinal wall bile salts make fatty acids soluble enabling both these and fatsoluble vitamins eg vitamin k to be readily absorbed stercobilin colours and deodorises the faeces release from the gall bladder when a meal has been eaten the hormone cck is secreted by the duodenum during the intestinal phase of secretion of gastric juice p 298 this stimulates contraction of the gall bladder and relaxation of the hepatopancreatic sphincter enabling the bile and pancreatic juice to pass into the duodenum together a more marked activity is noted if chyme entering the duodenum contains a high proportion of fat intestinal secretions the principal constituents of intestinal secretions are water mucus mineral salts enzyme enterokinase enteropeptidase most of the digestive enzymes in the small intestine are contained in the enterocytes of the walls of the villi digestion of carbohydrate protein and fat is completed by direct contact between these nutrients and the microvilli and within the enterocytes the enzymes involved in completing the chemical digestion of food in the enterocytes of the villi are peptidases lipase sucrase maltase and lactase chemical digestion associated with enterocytes alkaline intestinal juice ph 78 to 80 assists in raising the ph of the intestinal contents to between 65 and 75 enterokinase activates pancreatic peptidases such as trypsin which convert some polypeptides to amino acids and some to smaller peptides the final stage of breakdown to amino acids of all peptides occurs inside the enterocytes lipase completes the digestion of emulsified fats to fatty acids and glycerol partly in the intestine and partly in the enterocytes sucrase maltase and lactase complete the digestion of carbohydrates by converting disaccharides such as sucrose maltose and lactose to monosaccharides inside the enterocytes control of secretion mechanical stimulation of the intestinal glands by chyme is believed to be the main stimulus for the secretion of intestinal juice although the hormone secretin may also be involved absorption of nutrients fig1231 absorption of nutrients occurs by two possible processes diffusion monosaccharides amino acids fatty acids and glycerol diffuse slowly down their concentration gradients into the enterocytes from the intestinal lumen active transport monosaccharides amino acids fatty acids and glycerol may be actively transported into the villi this is faster than diffusion disaccharides dipeptides and tripeptides are also actively transported into the enterocytes where their digestion is completed before transfer into the capillaries of the villi monosaccharides and amino acids pass into the capillaries in the villi and fatty acids and glycerol into the lacteals some proteins are absorbed unchanged eg antibodies present in breast milk and oral vaccines such as poliomyelitis vaccine the extent of protein absorption is believed to be limited other nutrients such as vitamins mineral salts and water are also absorbed from the small intestine into the blood capillaries fatsoluble vitamins are absorbed into the lacteals along with fatty acids and glycerol vitamin b12 combines with intrinsic factor in the stomach and is actively absorbed in the terminal ileum the surface area through which absorption takes place in the small intestine is greatly increased by the circular folds of mucous membrane and by the very large number of villi and microvilli present it has been calculated that the surface area of the small intestine is about five times that of the whole body large amounts of fluid enter the alimentary tract each day fig 1232 of this only about 500ml is not absorbed by the small intestine and passes into the large intestine,the small intestine a 5meterlong tube in the abdominal cavity plays a vital role in digestion and nutrient absorption it connects the stomach to the large intestine through the ileocaecal valve and consists of three main sections the duodenum jejunum and ileum the duodenum receives bile and pancreatic juices crucial for breaking down fats proteins and carbohydrates the mucosal lining has circular folds villi and microvilli greatly increasing the surface area for nutrient absorption nutrients are absorbed through enterocytes in the villi either by diffusion or active transport enzymes like enterokinase activate pancreatic proteases and lipase breaks down fats aided by bile salts that emulsify fats to improve digestion hormones such as cholecystokinin cck and secretin regulate the secretion of bile and pancreatic juices responding to the presence of chyme from the stomach the small intestines functions include peristalsis for movement of contents secretion of intestinal juice completion of digestion protection against infection through lymphoid follicles and absorption of vital nutrients like monosaccharides amino acids and vitamins only about 500 ml of fluid continues to the large intestine as the small intestine absorbs most of the digestive tracts fluids
large intestine colon rectum and anal canal the large intestine this is about 15 metres long beginning at the caecum in the right iliac fossa and terminating at the rectum and anal canal deep in the pelvis its lumen is larger than that of the small intestine it forms an arch round the coiledup small intestine fig 1233 for descriptive purposes the colon is divided into the caecum ascending colon transverse colon descending colon sigmoid colon rectum and anal canal the caecum this is the first part of the colon it is a dilated region which has a blind end inferiorly and is continuous with the ascending colon superiorly just below the junction of the two the ileocaecal valve opens from the ileum the vermiform appendix is a fine tube closed at one end which leads from the caecum it is usually about 13 cm long and has the same structure as the walls of the colon but contains more lymphoid tissue fig 1234 the ascending colon this passes upwards from the caecum to the level of the liver where it curves acutely to the left at the hepatic flexure to become the transverse colon the transverse colon this is a loop of colon which extends across the abdominal cavity in front of the duodenum and the stomach to the area of the spleen where it forms the splenic flexure and curves acutely downwards to become the descending colon the descending colon this passes down the left side of the abdominal cavity then curves towards the midline after it enters the true pelvis it is known as the sigmoid colon the sigmoid colon this part describes an sshaped curve in the pelvis then continues downwards to become the rectum the rectum this is a slightly dilated section of the colon about 13 cm long it leads from the sigmoid colon and terminates in the anal canal the anal canal this is a short passage about 38 cm long in the adult and leads from the rectum to the exterior two sphincter muscles control the anus the internal sphincter consisting of smooth muscle fibres is under the control of the autonomic nervous system and the external sphincter formed by skeletal muscle is under voluntary control fig 1235 structure the four layers of tissue described in the basic structure of the gastrointestinal tract fig 122 are present in the colon the rectum and the anal canal the arrangement of the longitudinal muscle fibres is modified in the colon they do not form a smooth continuous layer of tissue but are collected into three bands called taeniae coli situated at regular intervals round the colon they stop at the junction of the sigmoid colon and the rectum as these bands of muscle tissue are slightly shorter than the total length of the colon they give a sacculated or puckered appearance to the organ fig 1235 the longitudinal muscle fibres spread out as in the basic structure and completely surround the rectum and the anal canal the anal sphincters are formed by thickening of the circular muscle layer in the submucosal layer there is more lymphoid tissue than in any other part of the alimentary tract providing nonspecific defence against invasion by resident and other microbes in the mucosal lining of the colon and the upper region of the rectum are large numbers of goblet cells forming simple tubular glands which secrete mucus they are not present beyond the junction between the rectum and the anus the lining membrane of the anus consists of stratified squamous epithelium continuous with the mucous membrane lining of the rectum above and which merges with the skin beyond the external anal sphincter in the upper section of the anal canal the mucous membrane is arranged in 6 to 10 vertical folds the anal columns each column contains a terminal branch of the superior rectal artery and vein blood supply arterial supply is mainly by the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries fig 128 the superior mesenteric artery supplies the caecum ascending and most of the transverse colon the inferior mesenteric artery supplies the remainder of the colon and the proximal part of the rectum the distal section of the rectum and the anus are supplied by branches from the internal iliac arteries venous drainage is mainly by the superior and inferior mesenteric veins which drain blood from the parts supplied by arteries of the same names these veins join the splenic and gastric veins to form the portal vein fig 129 veins draining the distal part of the rectum and the anus join the internal iliac veins functions of the large intestine rectum and anal canal absorption the contents of the ileum which pass through the ileocaecal valve into the caecum are fluid even though some water has been absorbed in the small intestine in the large intestine absorption of water continues until the familiar semisolid consistency of faeces is achieved mineral salts vitamins and some drugs are also absorbed into the blood capillaries from the large intestine microbial activity the large intestine is heavily colonised by certain types of bacteria which synthesise vitamin k and folic acid they include escherichia coli enterobacter aerogenes streptococcus faecalis and clostridium perfringens welchii these microbes are commensals in humans they may become pathogenic if transferred to another part of the body eg escherichia coli may cause cystitis if it gains access to the urinary bladder gases in the bowel consist of some of the constituents of air mainly nitrogen swallowed with food and drink and as a feature of some anxiety states hydrogen carbon dioxide and methane are produced by bacterial fermentation of unabsorbed nutrients especially carbohydrate gases pass out of the bowel as flatus large numbers of microbes are present in the faeces mass movement the large intestine does not exhibit peristaltic movement as it is seen in other parts of the digestive tract only at fairly long intervals about twice an hour does a wave of strong peristalsis sweep along the transverse colon forcing its contents into the descending and sigmoid colons this is known as mass movement and it is often precipitated by the entry of food into the stomach this combination of stimulus and response is called the gastrocolic reflex defaecation usually the rectum is empty but when a mass movement forces the contents of the sigmoid colon into the rectum the nerve endings in its walls are stimulated by stretch in the infant defaecation occurs by reflex involuntary action however sometime in the second or third year of life the ability to override the defaecation reflex is developed in practical terms this acquired voluntary control means that the brain can inhibit the reflex until such time as it is convenient to defaecate the external anal sphincter is under conscious control through the pudendal nerve thus defaecation involves involuntary contraction of the muscle of the rectum and relaxation of the internal anal sphincter contraction of the abdominal muscles and lowering of the diaphragm increase the intraabdominal pressure valsalvas manoeuvre and so assist the process of defaecation when defaecation is voluntarily postponed the feeling of fullness and need to defaecate tends to fade until the next mass movement occurs and the reflex is initiated again repeated suppression of the reflex may lead to constipation constituents of faeces the faeces consist of a semisolid brown mass the brown colour is due to the presence of stercobilin p 310 and fig 1241 even though absorption of water takes place in the large intestine water still makes up about 60 to 70 of the weight of the faeces the remainder consists of fibre indigestible cellular plant and animal material dead and live microbes epithelial cells from the walls of the tract fatty acids mucus secreted by the epithelial lining of the large intestine mucus helps to lubricate the faeces and an adequate amount of roughage in the diet ensures that the contents of the colon are sufficiently bulky to stimulate defaecation,the large intestine or colon is a 15meterlong organ beginning at the caecum and ending at the anal canal with a larger lumen than the small intestine its parts include the caecum ascending transverse descending sigmoid colon rectum and anal canal the large intestine absorbs water salts vitamins and some drugs changing liquid waste from the ileum into semisolid feces key bacteria such as e coli and streptococcus faecalis synthesize vitamins like k and produce gases from unabsorbed nutrients released as flatus unique movements like the mass movement a strong peristaltic wave that propels content through the colon and the gastrocolic reflex stimulated by food intake help move contents defecation combines reflex actions and voluntary control through the external sphincter it involves the rectal muscle contracting the internal sphincter relaxing and a rise in intraabdominal pressure achieved by contracting abdominal muscles valsalvas maneuver the colons structure features taeniae coli bands giving it a puckered look and goblet cells in the mucosa which secrete mucus for lubrication feces which are brown due to stercobilin consist of 6070 water indigestible fibers dead and live microbes epithelial cells and mucus
pancreas the pancreas is a pale grey gland weighing about 60 grams it is about 12 to 15 cm long and is situated in the epigastric and left hypochondriac regions of the abdominal cavity see figs 336 and 337 p 51 it consists of a broad head a body and a narrow tail the head lies in the curve of the duodenum the body behind the stomach and the tail lies in front of the left kidney and just reaches the spleen the abdominal aorta and the inferior vena cava lie behind the gland the pancreas is both an exocrine and endocrine gland the exocrine pancreas this consists of a large number of lobules made up of small alveoli the walls of which consist of secretory cells each lobule is drained by a tiny duct and these unite eventually to form the pancreatic duct which extends the whole length of the gland and opens into the duodenum just before entering the duodenum the pancreatic duct joins the common bile duct to form the hepatopancreatic ampulla the duodenal opening of the ampulla is controlled by the hepatopancreatic sphincter of oddi the function of the exocrine pancreas is to produce pancreatic juice containing enzymes that digest carbohydrates proteins and fats p 301 the endocrine pancreas distributed throughout the gland are groups of specialised cells called the pancreatic islets of langerhans the islets have no ducts so the hormones diffuse directly into the blood the function of the endocrine pancreas is to secrete the hormones insulin and glucagon which are principally concerned with control of blood glucose levels blood supply the splenic and mesenteric arteries supply arterial blood to the pancreas and the venous drainage is by the veins of the same names that join other veins to form the portal vein figs 127 and 129 nerve supply as in the alimentary tract parasympathetic stimulation increases the secretion of pancreatic juice and sympathetic stimulation depresses it liver the liver is the largest gland in the body weighing between 1 and 23 kg it is situated in the upper part of the abdominal cavity occupying the greater part of the right hypochondriac region part of the epigastric region and extending into the left hypochondriac region its upper and anterior surfaces are smooth and curved to fit the under surface of the diaphragm fig 1237 its posterior surface is irregular in outline fig 1238 organs associated with the liver superiorly and diaphragm and anterior abdominal anteriorly wall inferiorly stomach bile ducts duodenum hepatic flexure of the colon right kidney and adrenal gland posteriorly oesophagus inferior vena cava aorta gall bladder vertebral column and diaphragm laterally lower ribs and diaphragm the liver is enclosed in a thin inelastic capsule and incompletely covered by a layer of peritoneum folds of peritoneum form supporting ligaments attaching the liver to the inferior surface of the diaphragm it is held in position partly by these ligaments and partly by the pressure of the organs in the abdominal cavity the liver has four lobes the two most obvious are the large right lobe and the smaller wedgeshaped left lobe the other two the caudate and quadrate lobes are areas on the posterior surface fig 1238 the portal fissure this is the name given to the region on the posterior surface of the liver where various structures enter and leave the gland the portal vein enters carrying blood from the stomach spleen pancreas and the small and large intestines the hepatic artery enters carrying arterial blood it is a branch from the coeliac artery which is a branch from the abdominal aorta nerve fibres sympathetic and parasympathetic enter here the right and left hepatic ducts leave carrying bile from the liver to the gall bladder lymph vessels leave the liver draining some lymph to abdominal and some to thoracic nodes blood supply figs 127 and 129 the hepatic artery and the portal vein take blood to the liver hepatic veins varying in number leave the posterior surface and immediately enter the inferior vena cava just below the diaphragm structure the lobes of the liver are made up of tiny lobules just visible to the naked eye fig 1239a these lobules are hexagonal in outline and are formed by cubicalshaped cells the hepatocytes arranged in pairs of columns radiating from a central vein between two pairs of columns of cells there are sinusoids blood vessels with incomplete walls containing a mixture of blood from the tiny branches of the portal vein and hepatic artery fig 1239b this arrangement allows the arterial blood and portal venous blood with a high concentration of nutrients to mix and come into close contact with the liver cells amongst the cells lining the sinusoids are hepatic macrophages kupffer cells whose function is to ingest and destroy any foreign particles present in the blood flowing through the liver blood drains from the sinusoids into central or centrilobular veins these then join with veins from other lobules forming larger veins until eventually they become the hepatic veins which leave the liver and empty into the inferior vena cava just below the diaphragm figure 1240 shows the system of blood flow through the liver one of the functions of the liver is to secrete bile in figure 1239b it is seen that bile canaliculi run between the columns of liver cells this means that each column of hepatocytes has a blood sinusoid on one side and a bile canaliculus on the other the canaliculi join up to form larger bile canals until eventually they form the right and left hepatic ducts which drain bile from the liver lymphoid tissue and a system of lymph vessels are present in each lobule functions of the liver the liver is an extremely active organ some of its functions have already been described and they will only be mentioned here carbohydrate metabolism conversion of glucose to glycogen in the presence of insulin and converting liver glycogen back to glucose in the presence of glucagon these changes are important regulators of the blood glucose level after a meal the blood in the portal vein has a high glucose content and insulin converts some to glycogen for storage glucagon converts this glycogen back to glucose as required to maintain the blood glucose level within relatively narrow limits fat metabolism desaturation of fat ie converts stored fat to a form in which it can be used by the tissues to provide energy protein metabolism deamination of amino acids removes the nitrogenous portion from the amino acids not required for the formation of new protein urea is formed from this nitrogenous portion which is excreted in urine breaks down genetic material of wornout cells of the body to form uric acid which is excreted in the urine transamination removes the nitrogenous portion of amino acids and attaches it to other carbohydrate molecules forming new nonessential amino acids fig 1246 synthesis of plasma proteins and most of the blood clotting factors from the available amino acids occurs in the liver breakdown of erythrocytes and defence against microbes this is carried out by phagocytic kupffer cells hepatic macrophages in the sinusoids detoxification of drugs and noxious substances these include ethanol alcohol and toxins produced by microbes metabolism of ethanol this follows consumption of alcoholic drinks inactivation of hormones these include insulin glucagon cortisol aldosterone thyroid and sex hormones synthesis of vitamin a from carotene carotene is the provitamin found in some plants eg carrots and green leaves of vegetables production of heat the liver uses a considerable amount of energy has a high metabolic rate and produces a great deal of heat it is the main heatproducing organ of the body secretion of bile the hepatocytes synthesise the constituents of bile from the mixed arterial and venous blood in the sinusoids these include bile salts bile pigments and cholesterol storage the substances include fatsoluble vitamins a d e k iron copper some watersoluble vitamins eg riboflavine niacin pyridoxine folic acid and vitamin b12 composition of bile about 500 ml of bile are secreted by the liver daily bile consists of water mineral salts mucus bile pigments mainly bilirubin bile salts which are derived from the primary bile acids cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid cholesterol the bile acids cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid are synthesised by hepatocytes from cholesterol conjugated combined with either glycine or taurine then secreted into bile as sodium or potassium salts in the small intestine they emulsify fats aiding their digestion in the terminal ileum most of the bile salts are reabsorbed and return to the liver in the portal vein this enterohepatic circulation or recycling of bile salts ensures that large amounts of bile salts enter the small intestine daily from a relatively small bile acid pool fig 1241 bilirubin is one of the products of haemolysis of erythrocytes by hepatic macrophages kupffer cells in the liver and by other macrophages in the spleen and bone marrow in its original form bilirubin is insoluble in water and is carried in the blood bound to albumin in hepatocytes it is conjugated with glucuronic acid and becomes water soluble before being excreted in bile bacteria in the intestine change the form of bilirubin and most is excreted as stercobilinogen in the faeces a small amount is reabsorbed and excreted in urine as urobilinogen fig 1241 jaundice is yellow pigmentation of the tissues seen in the skin and conjunctiva caused by excess blood bilirubin p 337,the pancreas is a 1215 cm gland located behind the stomach it serves both exocrine digestive and endocrine hormonal functions the exocrine part consists of lobules with alveoli that produce pancreatic enzymes released into the duodenum the endocrine part contains islets of langerhans which secrete insulin and glucagon to regulate blood glucose blood supply comes from splenic and mesenteric arteries the liver weighing 123 kg is the bodys largest gland located in the upper right abdomen it has four lobes and is divided into hexagonal lobules with hepatocytes and kupffer cells functions include carbohydrate fat and protein metabolism detoxification and hormone inactivation the liver also produces bile which aids fat digestion and undergoes enterohepatic circulation kupffer cells break down red blood cells producing bilirubin bile contains water salts mucus and bilirubin and bile salts emulsify fats additionally the liver stores vitamins iron and copper and produces heat due to its high metabolic rate
biliary tract bile ducts fig 1242 the right and left hepatic ducts join to form the common hepatic duct just outside the portal fissure the hepatic duct passes downwards for about 3 cm where it is joined at an acute angle by the cystic duct from the gall bladder the cystic and hepatic ducts together form the common bile duct which passes downwards behind the head of the pancreas to be joined by the main pancreatic duct at the hepatopancreatic ampulla the opening of the combined ducts into the duodenum is controlled by the hepatopancreatic sphincter sphincter of oddi the common bile duct is about 75 cm long and has a diameter of about 6 mm structure the walls of the bile ducts have the same layers of tissue as those described in the basic structure of the alimentary canal fig 122 in the cystic duct the mucous membrane lining is arranged in irregularly situated circular folds which have the effect of a spiral valve bile passes through the cystic duct twice once on its way into the gall bladder and again when it is expelled from the gall bladder to the common bile duct and thence to the duodenum gall bladder the gall bladder is a pearshaped sac attached to the posterior surface of the liver by connective tissue it has a fundus or expanded end a body or main part and a neck which is continuous with the cystic duct structure the gall bladder has the same layers of tissue as those described in the basic structure of the alimentary canal with some modifications peritoneum covers only the inferior surface the gall bladder is in contact with the posterior surface of the right lobe of the liver and is held in place by the visceral peritoneum of the liver muscle layer there is an additional layer of oblique muscle fibres mucous membrane displays small rugae when the gall bladder is empty that disappear when it is distended with bile blood supply the cystic artery a branch of the hepatic artery supplies blood to the gall bladder blood is drained away by the cystic vein which joins the portal vein nerve supply nerve impulses are conveyed by sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve fibres there are the same autonomic plexuses as those described in the basic structure fig 122 functions of the gall bladder these include reservoir for bile concentration of the bile by up to 10 or 15fold by absorption of water through the walls of the gall bladder release of stored bile when the muscle wall of the gall bladder contracts bile passes through the bile ducts to the duodenum contraction is stimulated by the hormone cholecystokinin cck secreted by the duodenum the presence of fat and acid chyme in the duodenum relaxation of the hepatopancreatic sphincter of oddi is caused by cck and is a reflex response to contraction of the gall bladder,the biliary tract transports bile from the liver to the duodenum aiding digestion the right and left hepatic ducts from the liver merge into the common hepatic duct which connects to the cystic duct from the gall bladder forming the common bile duct this duct roughly 75 cm long runs behind the pancreas joining with the main pancreatic duct at the hepatopancreatic ampulla the flow into the duodenum is regulated by the hepatopancreatic sphincter sphincter of oddi the gall bladder is a pearshaped organ attached to the liver acting as a bile reservoir its walls are layered similarly to the alimentary canal with a muscle layer containing additional oblique muscle fibers and rugae which flatten when the gall bladder fills with bile blood supply comes from the cystic artery and nerve signals are conveyed by both sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers bile release triggered by cholecystokinin cck in response to fats in the duodenum facilitates fat digestion
metabolism metabolism constitutes all the chemical reactions that occur in the body using absorbed nutrients to provide energy by chemical oxidation of nutrients make new or replacement body substances two types of processes are involved catabolism this process breaks down large molecules into smaller ones releasing chemical energy that is stored as adenosine triphosphate atp and heat heat is used to maintain core body temperature at the optimum level for chemical activity 368c excess heat is lost through the skin and excreta p 365 anabolism this is building up or synthesis of large molecules from smaller ones and requires a source of energy usually atp anabolism and catabolism usually involve a series of chemical reactions known as metabolic pathways these permit controlled efficient and gradual transfer of energy from atp rather than large intracellular explosions metabolic pathways are switched on and off by hormones providing control of metabolism and meeting individual requirements both processes occur continually in all cells maintaining an energy balance very active tissues such as muscle or liver need an adequate energy supply to support their requirements energy the energy produced in the body may be measured and expressed in units of work joules or units of heat kilocalories a kilocalorie kcal is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 litre of water by 1 degree celsius 1c on a daily basis the bodys collective metabolic processes generate a total of about 3 million kilocalories 1 kcal 4184 joules j 4184 kilojoules kj the nutritional value of carbohydrates protein and fats eaten in the diet may be expressed in kilojoules per gram or kcal per gram 1 gram of carbohydrate provides 17 kilojoules 4 kcal 1 gram of protein provides 17 kilojoules 4 kcal 1 gram of fat provides 38 kilojoules 9 kcal energy balance body weight remains constant when energy intake in the form of nutrients is equal to energy use when intake exceeds requirement body weight increases conversely body weight decreases when nutrient intake does not meet energy requirements metabolic rate the metabolic rate is the rate at which energy is released from the fuel molecules inside cells as most of the processes involved require oxygen and produce carbon dioxide as waste the metabolic rate can be estimated by measuring oxygen uptake or carbon dioxide excretion the basal metabolic rate bmr is the rate of metabolism when the individual is at rest in a warm environment and is in the postabsorptive state ie has not had a meal for at least 12 hours in this state the release of energy is sufficient to meet only the essential needs of vital organs such as the heart lungs nervous system and kidneys the postabsorptive state is important because the intake of food especially protein stimulates an increase in metabolic rate possibly due to increased energy utilisation by the liver this is called the specific dynamic action sda of food in measuring the bmr the surface area of the body is taken into account because energy in the form of heat is lost through the skin surface area in square metres is calculated from the height and weight of the individual some of the wide variety of factors that affect the metabolic rate are shown in table 123 most foods contain a mixture of different amounts of carbohydrate protein fat minerals vitamins fibre and water carbohydrates proteins and fats are the sources of energy and they are obtained from the variety of food usually in the following proportions protein 1015 fat 1530 carbohydrate 5575 central metabolic pathways much of the metabolic effort of cells is concerned with energy production to fuel cellular activities certain common pathways are central to this function fuel molecules enter these central energyproducing pathways and in a series of steps during which a series of intermediate molecules are formed and energy is released these fuel molecules are chemically broken down the end results of these processes are energy production and carbon dioxide and water called metabolic water formation much of the energy is stored as atp although some is lost as heat the carbon dioxide is excreted through the lungs the preferred fuel molecule is glucose but alternatives should glucose be unavailable include amino acids fatty acids glycerol and occasionally nucleic acids each of these may enter the central energyproducing pathways and be converted to energy carbon dioxide and water there are three central metabolic pathways fig 1248 glycolysis the citric acid or krebs cycle oxidative phosphorylation products from glycolysis enter the citric acid cycle and products from the citric acid cycle proceed to oxidative phosphorylation the fates of the different fuel molecules entering the central metabolic pathways are discussed in the following sections metabolism of carbohydrate erythrocytes and neurones can use only glucose for fuel and therefore maintenance of blood glucose levels is needed to provide a constant energy source to these cells most other cells can also use other sources of fuel digested carbohydrate mainly glucose is absorbed into the blood capillaries of the villi of the small intestine it is transported by the portal circulation to the liver where it is dealt with in several ways fig 1243 glucose may be oxidised to provide the chemical energy in the form of atp necessary for the considerable metabolic activity which takes place in the liver p 309 some glucose may remain in the circulating blood to maintain the normal blood glucose of about 25 to 53 millimoles per litre mmol1 45 to 95 mg100 ml some glucose if in excess of the above requirements may be converted to the insoluble polysaccharide glycogen in the liver and in skeletal muscles insulin is the hormone necessary for this change to take place the formation of glycogen inside cells is a means of storing carbohydrate without upsetting the osmotic equilibrium before it can be used to maintain blood levels or to provide atp it must be broken down again into its constituent glucose units liver glycogen constitutes a store of glucose used for liver activity and to maintain the blood glucose level muscle glycogen provides the glucose requirement of muscle activity adrenaline thyroxine and glucagon are the main hormones associated with the breakdown of glycogen to glucose carbohydrate in excess of that required to maintain the blood glucose level and glycogen level in the tissues is converted to fat and stored in the fat depots all the cells of the body require energy to carry out their metabolic processes including multiplication of cells for replacement of worn out cells contraction of muscle fibres and synthesis of secretions produced by glandular tissues the oxidation of carbohydrate and fat provides most of the energy required by the body when glycogen stores are low and more glucose is needed the body can make glucose from noncarbohydrate sources eg amino acids glycerol this is called gluconeogenesis formation of new glucose carbohydrate and energy release fig 1244 glucose is broken down in the body giving energy carbon dioxide and metabolic water catabolism of glucose occurs in a series of steps with a little energy being released at each stage the total number of atp molecules which may be generated from the complete breakdown of one molecule of glucose is 38 but for this to be achieved the process must occur in the presence of oxygen aerobically in the absence of oxygen anaerobically this number is greatly reduced the process is therefore significantly less efficient aerobic respiration catabolism aerobic catabolism of glucose can occur only if the oxygen supply is adequate and is the process by which energy is released during prolonged manageable exercise when exercise levels become very intense the energy requirements of the muscle outstrip the oxygen supply and anaerobic breakdown then occurs such high levels of activity can be sustained for only short periods because there is accumulation of wastes mainly lactic acid and reduced efficiency of the energy production process the first stage of glucose catabolism is glycolysis this is an anaerobic process that takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell through a number of intermediate steps one glucose molecule is converted to two molecules of pyruvic acid with the net production of two molecules of atp the remainder of the considerable energy stores locked up in the original molecule of glucose is released only if there is enough oxygen to allow the pyruvic acid molecules to enter the biochemical roundabout called the citric acid cycle fig 1244 this takes place in the mitochondria of the cell and is oxygen dependent for every two molecules of pyruvic acid entering the citric acid cycle a further two molecules of atp are formed this is far short of the maximum 38 atp molecules that can be formed the remaining 34 molecules of atp come from the third energygenerating process oxidative phosphorylation a process dependent on hydrogen atoms released during earlier stages of glucose breakdown oxidative phosphorylation like the citric acid cycle can occur only in the presence of oxygen and takes place in the mitochondria anaerobic catabolism when oxygen levels in the cell are low the molecule of glucose still undergoes glycolysis and is split into two molecules of pyruvic acid because glycolysis is an anaerobic process however the pyruvic acid does not enter the citric acid cycle or progress to oxidative phosphorylation instead it is converted anaerobically to lactic acid buildup of lactic acid causes the pain and cramps of overexercised muscles when oxygen levels are restored lactic acid is reconverted to pyruvic acid which may then enter the citric acid cycle fate of the end products of carbohydrate metabolism lactic acid some of the lactic acid produced by anaerobic catabolism of glucose may be oxidised in the cells to carbon dioxide and water but first it must be changed back to pyruvic acid if complete oxidation does not take place lactic acid passes to the liver in the circulating blood where it is converted to glucose and may then take any of the pathways open to glucose fig 1243 carbon dioxide this is excreted from the body as a gas by the lungs metabolic water this is added to the considerable amount of water already present in the body excess is excreted as urine by the kidneys,metabolism refers to all chemical reactions in the body divided into catabolism breaking down molecules to release energy stored in atp and heat and anabolism building molecules requiring energy the energy from these reactions can be measured in kilocalories or joules key nutrients carbohydrates proteins fats have specific energy values with carbohydrates and proteins providing 17 kjg and fats providing 38 kjg energy balance occurs when energy intake matches energy expenditure maintaining body weight metabolic rate reflects the speed of cellular energy release estimated via oxygen intake or co output the basal metabolic rate bmr is the resting energy expenditure needed for essential organs central metabolic pathwaysglycolysis citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylationefficiently convert fuel mainly glucose to energy co and water with glucose as the preferred fuel aerobic respiration fully breaks down glucose to generate 38 atp molecules while anaerobic catabolism without oxygen produces lactic acid leading to fatigue end products of metabolism include carbon dioxide exhaled water excreted by kidneys and lactic acid converted back to pyruvate or glucose in the liver
diseases of the mouth inflammatory and infectious conditions physical damage injury may be caused to tissues in and around the mouth by foods and other substances taken into the mouth if they are excessively hot or cold abrasive corrosive corrosive chemicals are the most likely to cause serious tissue damage and acute inflammation the outcome depends on the extent and depth of the injury thrush oral candidiasis this acute fungal infection of the epithelium of the mouth is caused by the yeast candida albicans in adults it causes infection mainly in debilitated people and in those whose immunity is suppressed by steroids antibiotics or cytotoxic drugs in babies it may be a severe infection sometimes causing epidemics in nurseries by crossinfection it occurs most commonly in bottlefed babies chronic thrush may develop affecting the roof of the mouth in people who wear dentures the fungus survives in the fine grooves on the upper surface of the denture and repeatedly reinfects the epithelium angular cheilitis painful cracks develop in folds of tissue at the corners of the mouth usually occurring in elderly debilitated people especially if they do not wear their dentures and the folds remain moist the usual causal organisms are candida albicans and staphylococcus aureus dietary deficiency of iron and vitamins in the b group predispose to this condition acute gingivitis vincents infection this is an acute infection with severe ulceration of the lips gums mouth throat and the palatine tonsil it is caused by two commensal organisms acting together borrelia vincenti and a fusiform bacillus both organisms may be present in the mouth and only cause the disease in the presence of malnutrition debilitating disease poor mouth hygiene injury caused by previous infection aphthous stomatitis recurrent oral ulceration extremely painful ulcers occur singly or in crops inside the mouth they are often found in association with iron and vitamin b group deficiency but a link has not been established viral infections acute herpetic gingivostomatitis this is caused by herpes simplex virus and is the commonest oral virus infection it is characterised by extensive and very painful ulceration secondary or recurrent herpes lesions cold sores lesions caused by herpes simplex virus occur round the nose and on the lips after an outbreak the viruses remain dormant within the cells later outbreaks usually at the same site are precipitated by a variety of stimuli including failing immune response in old age tumours of the mouth squamous cell carcinoma this is the most common type of malignant tumour in the mouth and carries a poor prognosis the usual sites are the lower lip and the edge of the tongue ulceration occurs frequently and there is early spread to surrounding tissues and cervical lymph nodes developmental defects cleft palate and cleft lip harelip during embryonic development the roof of the mouth hard palate develops as two separate right and left halves this occurs from the lips anteriorly to the uvula posteriorly before birth these two halves fuse along the midline if fusion is incomplete a cleft division occurs which may be very minor or it may be substantial cleft lip fig 1249b may be merely a minor notch in the upper lip or substantial when the lip is completely split in one or two places and the nose is involved in cleft palate there is a gap between the two halves of the palate which creates a channel of communication between the mouth and the nasal cavity fig 1249c factors believed to play a causative part in these conditions include genetic abnormalities and fetal exposure to detrimental factors such as hypoxia certain drugs or poor nutrition between weeks 7 and 10 of pregnancy speech development and the activities of eating and drinking cannot take place normally until the defect has been surgically repaired diseases of the salivary glands mumps this is an acute inflammatory condition of the salivary glands especially the parotids it is caused by the mumps virus one of the parainfluenza group the virus is inhaled in infected droplets and during the 18 to 21day incubation period viruses multiply elsewhere in the body before spreading to the salivary glands the virus is present in saliva for about 7 days before and after symptoms appear so infection may spread to others during this 2week period they may also spread to the pancreas causing pancreatitis the testes causing orchitis after puberty and sometimes atrophy of the glands and sterility the brain causing meningitis or meningoencephalitis in developed countries children are usually vaccinated against mumps in their preschool years calculus formation calculi stones are formed in the salivary glands by the crystallisation of mineral salts in saliva they may partially or completely block the ducts leading to swelling of the gland a predisposition to infection and in time atrophy the causes are not known tumours of the salivary glands mixed tumours pleomorphic salivary adenoma this benign tumour consists of epithelial and connective tissue cells and occurs mainly in the parotid gland a second tumour may develop in the same gland several years after the first has been removed it rarely undergoes malignant change carcinoma malignant tumours may occur in any salivary gland or duct some forms have a tendency to infiltrate nerves in the surrounding tissues causing severe pain lymph spread is to the cervical nodes diseases of the oesophagus oesophageal varices fig 1250 in conditions such as cirrhosis or venous thrombosis blood flow into the liver via the portal vein is obstructed and blood pressure within the portal system rises portal hypertension this forces blood from the portal vein into anastomotic veins which redirect shunt blood into the systemic venous circulation bypassing the liver fifty per cent or more of the portal blood may be shunted into anastomotic veins leading to rising pressure in these veins too one route taken by the shunted blood is into veins of the distal oesophagus which become distended and weakened by the abnormally high volume of blood varices develop when the weakest regions of the vessel wall bulge outwards into the lumen of the oesophagus and being thin walled and fragile they are easily eroded by swallowed foodstuffs bleeding may be slight but chronic leading to iron deficiency anaemia however sudden rupture can cause lifethreatening haemorrhage inflammatory and infectious conditions peptic reflux oesophagitis this condition the commonest cause of indigestion is caused by persistent regurgitation of acid gastric juice into the oesophagus causing irritation and painful ulceration haemorrhage occurs when blood vessels are eroded persistent reflux leads to chronic inflammation and if damage is extensive secondary healing with fibrosis occurs shrinkage of ageing fibrous tissue may cause stricture of the oesophagus reflux of gastric contents is associated with increase in the intraabdominal pressure eg in pregnancy constipation and obesity high acid content of gastric juice low levels of secretion of the hormone gastrin leading to reduced sphincter action at the lower end of the oesophagus the presence of hiatus hernia p 330 swallowing caustic materials when swallowed caustic materials burn the walls of the oesophagus causing an inflammatory reaction the extent of the damage depends on the concentration and amount swallowed following severe injury healing causes fibrosis and there is a risk of oesophageal stricture developing later as the fibrous tissue shrinks microbial infections infections are relatively rare and are usually spread from the mouth or pharynx the microbes most commonly involved are candida albicans which causes thrush and herpes viruses bottlefed babies and adults with diminished immunity are most susceptible achalasia this problem tends to occur in young adults the cardiac sphincter is constricted and because of this obstruction blocking the passage of ingested materials into the stomach the oesophagus becomes dilated and the muscle layer hypertrophies autonomic nerve supply to the oesophageal muscle is abnormal but the cause of the condition is not known the condition may lead to dysphagia regurgitation of gastric contents and possibly aspiration pneumonia oesophageal rupture this may occur usually at the distal end if the oesophagus is suddenly distended during a vomiting attack by ingestion of foreign bodies by passage of an instrument gastric contents pass into the mediastinum causing acute inflammation the cause of weakness in the wall of the oesophagus is not known tumours of the oesophagus benign tumours occur rarely malignant tumours these occur more often in males than females the most common sites are the distal end of the oesophagus and at the levels of the larynx and bifurcation of the trachea the tumours are mainly of two types either of which may eventually lead to oesophageal obstruction scirrhous fibrous tumours these spread round the circumference and along the oesophagus they cause thickening of the wall and loss of elasticity soft tissue tumours these grow into the lumen and spread along the wall the causes of malignant change are not known but may be associated with diet and regular consumption of very hot food spread of a malignant tumour at the level of the bifurcation of the trachea may ulcerate the wall of the oesophagus the trachea or a bronchus leading to aspiration pneumonia other local spread may involve adjacent mediastinal structures such as lymph nodes death is usually due to oesophageal obstruction before metastasis occurs congenital abnormalities the most common congenital abnormalities of the oesophagus are oesophageal atresia in which the lumen is narrow or blocked tracheooesophageal fistula in which there is an opening between the oesophagus and the trachea through which milk or regurgitated gastric contents are aspirated one or both abnormalities may be present the causes of these developmental deficiencies are not known,the mouth and esophagus can be affected by various diseases involving inflammation infection physical damage developmental defects and tumors thrush oral candidiasis is a fungal infection caused by candida albicans affecting immunocompromised individuals and bottlefed babies angular cheilitis is a painful condition caused by yeast and bacteria often due to iron and vitamin deficiencies acute gingivitis vincents infection and aphthous stomatitis are infections that involve painful ulcerations viral infections like herpes can cause extensive mouth ulceration and recurrent cold sores tumors especially squamous cell carcinoma often appear on the lip or tongue and have a high spread risk developmental defects include cleft lip and palate impairing feeding and speech the salivary glands can be affected by mumps and stone formation calculi which cause inflammation or obstruction in the esophagus oesophageal varices dilated veins occur due to portal hypertension with rupture risking lifethreatening bleeding peptic reflux oesophagitis or acid reflux leads to ulceration and potential scarring other esophageal issues include achalasia muscle constriction microbial infections and malignant tumors particularly in men congenital abnormalities such as oesophageal atresia and tracheooesophageal fistula disrupt normal esophageal function
diseases of the stomach gastritis this is a common condition which occurs when an imbalance between the corrosive action of gastric juice and the protective effect of mucus on the gastric mucosa develops the amount of mucus in the stomach is insufficient to protect the surface epithelium from the destructive effects of hydrochloric acid it may be acute or chronic acute gastritis gastritis occurs with varying degrees of severity the most severe form is acute haemorrhagic gastritis when the surface epithelium of the stomach is exposed to acid gastric juice the cells absorb hydrogen ions which increase their internal acidity disrupt their metabolic processes and trigger the inflammatory reaction the causes of acute gastritis include regular prolonged use of aspirin and other antiinflammatory drugs especially the nonsteroids regular excessive alcohol consumption food poisoning caused by eg staphylococcus aureus salmonella paratyphi or viruses heavy cigarette smoking treatment with cytotoxic drugs and ionising radiation ingestion of corrosive poisons acids and alkalis regurgitation of bile into the stomach the outcome depends on the extent of the damage in many cases recovery is uneventful after the cause is removed in the most severe forms there is ulceration of the mucosa that may be followed by haemorrhage perforation of the stomach wall and peritonitis where there has been extensive tissue damage healing is by fibrosis causing reduced elasticity and peristalsis chronic gastritis chronic gastritis is a milder longerlasting form it may follow repeated acute attacks or be an autoimmune disease and is more common in later life helicobacterassociated gastritis the microbe helicobacter pylori is known to be associated with gastric conditions especially chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer disease antibodies to this microbe develop in early adulthood although lesions of gastritis occur later in life autoimmune chronic gastritis this is a progressive form of the disease destructive inflammatory changes that begin on the surface of the mucous membrane may extend to affect its whole thickness including the gastric glands when this stage is reached the secretion of digestive enzymes hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor are markedly reduced the antigens are the gastric parietal cells and the intrinsic factor they secrete when these cells are destroyed as a result of this abnormal autoimmune condition the inflammation subsides the initial causes of the autoimmunity are not known but there is a familial predisposition and an association with chronic thyroiditis thyrotoxicosis and atrophy of the adrenal glands secondary effects include pernicious anaemia due to lack of intrinsic factor p 70 impairment of digestion due to lack of enzymes microbial infection due to lack of hydrochloric acid peptic ulceration ulceration of the gastrointestinal mucosa is caused by disruption of the normal balance of the corrosive effect of gastric juice and the protective effect of mucus on the gastric epithelial cells it may be viewed as an extension of the cell damage found in acute gastritis the most common sites for ulcers are the stomach and the first few centimetres of the duodenum more rarely they occur in the oesophagus following reflux of gastric juice and round the anastomosis of the stomach and small intestine following gastrectomy the underlying causes are not known but if factors associated with the maintenance of healthy mucosa are defective acid gastric juice gains access to the epithelium causing the initial cell damage that leads to ulceration the main factors are normal blood supply mucus secretion and cell replacement blood supply reduced blood flow and ischaemia may be caused by excessive cigarette smoking and stress either physical or mental in a stressful situation there is an increase in the secretion of the hormones noradrenaline and adrenaline and these cause constriction of the blood vessels supplying the alimentary tract secretion of mucus the composition and the amount of mucus may be altered eg by regular and prolonged use of aspirin and other antiinflammatory drugs by the reflux of bile acids and salts in chronic gastritis epithelial cell replacement there is normally a rapid turnover of gastric and intestinal epithelial cells this may be reduced by raised levels of steroid hormones eg in response to stress or when they are used as drugs in chronic gastritis by irradiation and the use of cytotoxic drugs in peptic ulcer disease the alimentary tract is commonly colonised by the bacterium helicobacter pylori a causative agent in this disorder acute peptic ulcers these lesions involve tissue to the depth of the submucosa and the lesions may be single or multiple they are found in many sites in the stomach and in the first few centimetres of the duodenum the underlying causes are unknown but their development is often associated with severe stress eg severe illness shock burns severe emotional disturbance and following surgery healing without the formation of fibrous tissue usually occurs when the cause of the stress is removed chronic peptic ulcers these ulcers penetrate through the epithelial and muscle layers of the stomach wall and may include the adjacent pancreas or liver in the majority of cases they occur singly in the pyloric antrum of the stomach and in the duodenum occasionally there are two ulcers facing each other in the duodenum called kissing ulcers healing occurs with the formation of fibrous tissue and subsequent shrinkage may cause stricture of the lumen of the stomach stenosis of the pyloric sphincter adhesions to adjacent structures eg pancreas liver transverse colon complications of peptic ulcers haemorrhage acid gastric juice may cause the development of many tiny ulcers or gastric erosions leading to multiple capillary bleeding points and possibly iron deficiency anaemia p 69 when a major artery is eroded a serious and possibly lifethreatening haemorrhage may occur causing shock p 1ll haematemesis vomiting of blood melaena blood in the faeces perforation when an ulcer erodes through the full thickness of the wall of the stomach or duodenum their contents enter the peritoneal cavity causing acute peritonitis p 325 infected inflammatory material may collect under the diaphragm forming a subphrenic abscess and the infection may spread through the diaphragm to the pleural cavity pyloric stenosis fibrous tissue formed as an ulcer in the pyloric region heals and may cause narrowing of the pylorus obstructing outflow from the stomach and resulting in persistent vomiting development of a malignant tumour this may complicate gastric ulceration tumours of the stomach benign tumours of the stomach occur rarely malignant tumours this is a relatively common form of malignancy and it occurs more frequently in men than women the local growth of the tumour gradually destroys the normal tissue so that achlorhydria reduced hydrochloric acid secretion and pernicious anaemia are frequently secondary features the causes have not been established but there appears to be a familial predisposition an association with diet highsalt diets and regular consumption of smoked or pickled foods increase the risk the presence of other diseases eg chronic gastritis chronic ulceration and pernicious anaemia spread of gastric carcinoma local spread these tumours spread locally to the remainder of the stomach to the oesophagus duodenum omentum liver and pancreas the spleen is seldom affected as the tumour grows the surface may ulcerate and become infected especially when achlorhydria develops lymphatic spread this occurs early in the disease at first the spread is within the lymph channels in the stomach wall and then to lymph nodes round the stomach in the mesentery omentum and walls of the small intestine and colon blood spread the common sites for bloodspread metastases are the liver lungs brain and bones peritoneal spread when a tumour includes the full thickness of the stomach wall small groups of cells may break off and spread throughout the peritoneal cavity metastases may develop in any tissue in the abdominal or pelvic cavity where the fragments settle congenital pyloric stenosis in this condition there is spasmodic constriction of the pyloric sphincter characteristic projective vomiting and failure to put on weight in an attempt to overcome the spasms hypertrophy of the muscle of the pyloric antrum develops causing obstruction of the pylorus 2 to 3 weeks after birth the reason for the excess stimulation or neuromuscular abnormality of the pylorus is not known but there is a familial tendency and it is more common in males,stomach diseases commonly include gastritis peptic ulcers and tumors gastritis arises from an imbalance between the corrosive gastric acid and protective mucus resulting in inflammation of the stomach lining acute gastritis can be severe often caused by prolonged drug use eg aspirin alcohol food poisoning or stress with the most intense cases leading to ulceration and hemorrhage chronic gastritis may follow repeated acute attacks or occur as an autoimmune disorder often associated with helicobacter pylori a bacterium linked to gastritis and peptic ulcers peptic ulcers are sores in the stomach or duodenal lining that form when mucus is insufficient allowing acid to penetrate and damage the epithelium causes include chronic stress smoking and bacterial infection ulcers can result in bleeding perforation and pyloric stenosis narrowing of the stomach outlet and in some cases lead to cancer stomach tumors range from rare benign growths to common malignant types often linked to dietary factors eg highsalt foods and genetic predisposition malignant tumors can spread locally to nearby organs through lymphatics and via the bloodstream to distant areas like the liver and lungs congenital pyloric stenosis a condition in infants causes severe vomiting due to spasms in the pyloric muscle
diseases of the intestines diseases of the small and large intestines will be described together because they have certain characteristics in common and some conditions affect both appendicitis the lumen of the appendix is very small and there is little room for swelling when it becomes inflamed the initial cause of inflammation is not always clear microbial infection is commonly superimposed on obstruction by eg hard faecal matter faecoliths kinking or a foreign body inflammatory exudate with fibrin and phagocytes causes swelling and ulceration of the mucous membrane lining in the initial stages the pain of appendicitis is usually located in the central area of the abdomen after a few hours the pain shifts and is localised to the region above the appendix the right iliac fossa see also p 174 in mild cases the inflammation subsides and healing takes place in more severe cases microbial growth progresses leading to suppuration abscess formation and further congestion the rising pressure inside the appendix occludes first the veins then the arteries and ischaemia develops followed by gangrene and rupture complications of appendicitis peritonitis the peritoneum becomes acutely inflamed the blood vessels dilate and excess serous fluid is secreted it occurs as a complication of appendicitis when microbes spread through the wall of the appendix and infect the peritoneum an appendix abscess ruptures and pus enters the peritoneal cavity the appendix becomes gangrenous and ruptures discharging its contents into the peritoneal cavity abscess formation the most common abscesses are fig 1251 subphrenic abscess between the liver and diaphragm from which infection may spread upwards to the pleura pericardium and mediastinal structures pelvic abscess from which infection may spread to adjacent structures fibrous adhesions when healing takes place fibrous tissue forms and later shrinkage may cause stricture or obstruction of the bowel limitation of the movement of a loop of bowel which may twist around the adhesion causing a type of bowel obstruction called a volvulus p 330 microbial diseases fig1252 typhoid fever this type of enteritis is caused by the microbe salmonella typhi ingested in food and water humans are its only host so the source of contamination is an individual who is either suffering from the disease or is a carrier after ingestion of microbes there is an incubation period of about 14 days before signs of the disease appear during this period the microbes invade lymphoid tissue in the walls of the small and large intestine especially the aggregated lymph follicles peyers patches and solitary lymph nodes the microbes then enter the blood vessels and spread to the liver spleen and gall bladder in the bacteraemic period acute inflammation develops with necrosis of intestinal lymphoid tissue and ulceration of overlying mucosa other effects of salmonella typhi or their endotoxins include typhoid cholecystitis in which the microbes multiply in the gall bladder and are excreted in bile reinfecting the intestine red spots on the skin especially of the chest and abdomen enlargement of the spleen myocardial damage and endocarditis liver and kidney damage reduced resistance to other infections especially of the respiratory tract eg laryngitis bronchitis pneumonia uncomplicated recovery takes place in about 5 weeks with healing of intestinal ulcers and very little fibrosis complications the ulcers may penetrate a blood vessel causing haemorrhage or erode the intestinal wall leading to acute peritonitis the individual may become a carrier when this happens the typhoid fever becomes a chronic asymptomatic infection of the biliary and urinary tracts microbes continue to be excreted indefinitely in urine and faeces contamination of food and water by carriers is the usual source of infection paratyphoid fever this disease is caused by salmonella paratyphi a or b spread in the same way as typhoid fever ie in food and drink contaminated by infected urine or faeces the infection causing inflammation of the intestinal mucosa is usually confined to the ileum other parts of the body are not usually affected but occasionally chronic infection of the urinary and biliary tracts occurs and the individual becomes an asymptomatic carrier excreting the microbes in urine and faeces other salmonella infections salmonella typhimurium and s enteritidis are the most common infecting microbes in this group in addition to humans their hosts are domestic animals and birds the microbes may be present in meat poultry eggs and milk causing infection if cooking does not achieve sterilisation mice and rats also carry the organisms and may contaminate food before or after cooking the infection is usually of short duration but may be accompanied by acute abdominal pain and diarrhoea causing dehydration and electrolyte imbalance in children and debilitated elderly people the infection may be severe or even fatal chronic infection of the biliary and urinary tracts may develop and the individual becomes a carrier excreting the organisms in urine and faeces fig 1252 escherichia coli e coli food poisoning common sources for these organisms include undercooked meat and unpasteurised milk adequate cooking kills e coli the severity of the disease depends on the type of e coli responsible some types are more virulent than others and outbreaks of coli food poisoning can cause fatalities particularly in the elderly staphylococcal food poisoning this is not an infection in the true sense acute gastroenteritis is caused by toxins produced by the staphylococcus aureus before ingestion of the contaminated food the organisms are usually killed by cooking but the toxins can withstand higher temperatures and remain unchanged there is usually shortterm acute inflammation with violent vomiting and diarrhoea causing dehydration and electrolyte imbalance in most cases complete recovery occurs within 24 hours clostridium perfringens cl welchii food poisoning these microbes although normally present in the intestines of humans and animals cause food poisoning when ingested in large numbers meat may be contaminated at any stage between slaughter and the consumer outbreaks of food poisoning are associated with largescale cooking eg in institutions the spores survive the initial cooking and if the food is cooled slowly they enter the vegetative phase and multipy between the temperatures of 50c and 20c following refrigeration the microbes multiply if the food is reheated slowly after being eaten microbes that remain vegetative die and release endotoxins that cause gastroenteritis campylobacter food poisoning these gramnegative bacilli are a common cause of gastroenteritis accompanied by fever acute pain and sometimes bleeding they affect mainly young adults and children under 5 years the microbes are present in the intestines of birds and animals and are spread in undercooked poultry and meat they may also be spread in water and milk pets such as cats and dogs may be a source of infection cholera cholera is caused by vibrio cholerae and is spread by contaminated water food hands and fomites the only known hosts are humans a very powerful toxin is produced by the bacteria which stimulates the intestinal glands to secrete large quantities of water bicarbonate and chloride this leads to persistent diarrhoea severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalance and may cause death due to hypovolaemic shock the microbes occasionally spread to the gall bladder where they multiply they are then excreted in bile and faeces this carrier state usually lasts for a maximum of about 4 years providing a reservoir for spread of infection dysentery baciilary dysentery this infection of the colon is caused by bacteria of the shigella group the severity of the condition depends on the organisms involved in britain it is usually a relatively mild condition caused by shigella sonnei outbreaks may reach epidemic proportions especially in institutions children and elderly debilitated adults are particularly susceptible the only host is humans and the organisms are spread by faecal contamination of food drink hands and fomites the intestinal mucosa becomes inflamed ulcerated and oedematous with excess mucus secretion in severe infections the acute diarrhoea containing blood and excess mucus causes dehydration electrolyte imbalance and anaemia when healing occurs the mucous membrane is fully restored occasionally a chronic infection develops and the individual becomes a carrier excreting the microbes in faeces shigella dysenteriae causes the most severe type of infection it occurs mainly in tropical countries amoebic dysentery this disease is caused by entamoeba histolytica the only known hosts are humans and it is spread by faecal contamination of food water hands and fomites before ingestion the amoebae are inside resistant cysts when these reach the colon they grow and divide and invade the mucosal cells causing inflammation and ulceration further development of the disease may result in destruction of the mucosa over a large area and sometimes perforation occurs diarrhoea containing mucus and blood is persistent and debilitating the disease may progress in a number of ways healing may produce fibrous adhesions causing partial or complete obstruction the amoebae may spread to the liver causing amoebic hepatitis and abscesses chronic dysentery may develop with intermittent diarrhoea and amoebae in the faeces although most infected people do not develop symptoms they may become carriers inflammatory bowel disease table 124 crohns disease regional ileitis this chronic inflammatory condition of the alimentary tract usually occurs in young adults the terminal ileum and the rectum are most commonly affected but the disease may be more widespread there is chronic patchy inflammation with oedema of the full thickness of the intestinal wall causing partial obstruction of the lumen sometimes described as skip lesions there are periods of remission of varying duration the cause of crohns disease is not entirely clear but it may be that immunological abnormality renders the individual susceptible to infection especially by viruses complications include secondary infections occurring when inflamed areas ulcerate fibrous adhesions and subsequent intestinal obstruction caused by the healing process fistulae between intestinal lesions and adjacent structures eg loops of bowel surface of the skin p 378 perianal fistula formation megaloblastic anaemia due to malabsorption of vitamin b12 and folic acid cancer of the small or large intestine ulcerative colitis this is a chronic inflammatory disease of the mucosa of the colon and rectum which may ulcerate and become infected it usually occurs in young adults and begins in the rectum and sigmoid colon from there it may spread to involve a variable proportion of the colon and sometimes the entire colon there are periods of remission lasting weeks months or years the cause is not known but there is an association with arthritis iritis some skin lesions haemolytic anaemia and some drug sensitivities in longstanding cases cancer sometimes develops fulminating ulcerative colitis this is also called toxic megacolon the colon loses its muscle tone and dilates the wall becomes thinner and perforation which may be fatal may follow there is a sudden onset of acute diarrhoea with severe blood loss leading to dehydration electrolyte imbalance perforation hypovolaemic shock and possibly death diverticular disease diverticula are small pouches of mucosa that protrude into the peritoneal cavity through the circular muscle fibres of the colon between the taeniae coli fig 1253 the walls consist of mucous membrane with a covering of visceral peritoneum they occur at the weakest points of the intestinal wall ie where the blood vessels enter most commonly in the sigmoid colon diverticulitis arises when faeces impact in the diverticula and the walls become inflamed and oedematous as secondary infection develops this reduces the blood supply causing ischaemic pain occasionally rupture occurs resulting in peritonitis the causes of diverticulosis presence of diverticuli are not known but it is associated with lowresidue diet and abnormally active peristalsis in western countries diverticulosis is fairly common after the age of 60 but diverticulitis affects only a small proportion tumours of the small and large intestines benign and malignant tumours of the small intestine are rare compared with their occurrence in the stomach and colon benign tumours benign neoplasms may form a broadbased mass or develop a pedicle occasionally those with pedicles twist upon themselves causing ischaemia necrosis and possibly gangrene malignant changes may occur malignant tumours small intestine malignant tumours tend not to obstruct the lumen and may remain unnoticed until symptoms caused by metastases appear the most common sites of metastases are local lymph nodes the liver lungs and brain the colon this is the most common site of malignancy in the alimentary tract in western countries the tumour may be a soft friable mass projecting into the lumen of the colon with a tendency to ulceration infection and haemorrhage a hard fibrous mass encircling the colon causing reduced elasticity and peristalsis and narrowing of the lumen a gelatinous mucoid mass that thickens the wall and tends to ulcerate and become infected the most important factor for colorectal cancer is thought to be diet in cultures eating a highfibre lowfat diet the disease is virtually unknown whereas in western countries where large quantities of red meat and insufficient fibre are eaten the disease is much more common slow movement of bowel contents may result in the conversion of as yet unknown substances that are present into carcinogenic agents predisposing diseases include ulcerative colitis and some benign tumours local spread of intestinal tumours occurs early but may not be evident until there is severe ulceration and haemorrhage or obstruction spread can be outwards through the wall into the peritoneal cavity and adjacent structures lymphspread metastases occur in mesenteric lymph nodes the peritoneum and other abdominal and pelvic organs pressure caused by enlarged lymph nodes may cause obstruction or damage other structures bloodspread metastases are most common in the liver brain and bones carcinoid tumours argentaffinomas these tumours are considered on clinical evidence to be benign but they spread into the tissues around their original site they grow very slowly and rarely metastasise the parent cells are hormonesecreting cells widely dispersed throughout the body not situated in endocrine glands some of these tumours secrete hormones while others do not they are called apud cells an acronym for some of their chemical characteristics the cells react with silver compounds hence the name argentaffinomas common sites in the intestines for these apudomas are the appendix ileum stomach colon and rectum the tumours are frequently multiple and may spread locally causing obstruction carcinoid syndrome this is the name given to the effects of the variety of substances secreted by apudomas in the intestine and elsewhere the secretions include serotonin 5hydroxytryptamine histamine and bradykinin and the effects include flushing attacks tachycardia sweating anxiety and diarrhoea hernias a hernia is a protrusion of bowel through a weak point in the musculature of the anterior abdominal wall or an existing opening fig 1254a it occurs when there are intermittent increases in intraabdominal pressure most commonly in men who lift heavy loads at work the underlying causes of the abdominal wall weakness are not known possible outcomes include spontaneous reduction ie the loop of bowel slips back to its correct place when the intraabdominal pressure returns to normal manual reduction ie by applying slight pressure over the abdominal swelling strangulation when the venous drainage from the herniated loop of bowel is impaired causing congestion ischaemia and gangrene in addition there is intestinal obstruction sites of hernias fig 1254b inguinal hernia the weak point is the inguinal canal which contains the spermatic cord in the male and the round ligament in the female it occurs more commonly in males than in females femoral hernia the weak point is the femoral canal through which the femoral artery vein and lymph vessels pass from the pelvis to the thigh umbilical hernia the weak point is the umbilicus where the umbilical blood vessels from the placenta enter the fetus incisional hernia this is caused by repeated stretching of the fibrous tissue formed during the repair of a surgical wound diaphragmatic or hiatus hernia fig 1254c this is the protrusion of a part of the fundus of the stomach through the oesophageal opening in the diaphragm the main complication is irritation caused by reflux of acid gastric juice especially when the individual lies flat or bends down the longterm effects may be oesophagitis fibrosis and narrowing of the oesophagus causing dysphagia strangulation does not occur sliding hiatus hernia an unusually short oesophagus that ends above the diaphragm pulls a part of the stomach upwards into the thorax the abnormality may be congenital or be caused by shrinkage of fibrous tissue formed during healing of a previous oesophageal injury the sliding movement of the stomach in the oesophageal opening is due to normal shortening of the oesophagus by muscular contraction during swallowing rolling hiatus hernia an abnormally large opening in the diaphragm allows a pouch of stomach to roll upwards into the thorax beside the oesophagus this is associated with obesity and increased intraabdominal pressure peritoneal hernia a loop of bowel may herniate through the foramen of winslow the opening in the lesser omentum that separates the greater and lesser peritoneal sacs volvulus this occurs when a loop of bowel twists through 180 cutting off its blood supply causing gangrene and obstruction it occurs in parts of the intestine that are attached to the posterior abdominal wall by a long double fold of visceral peritoneum the mesentery the most common site in adults is the sigmoid colon and in children the small intestine the causes are unknown but predisposing factors include an unusually long mesocolon or mesentery heavy loading of the pelvic colon with faeces a slight twist of a loop of bowel causing gas and fluid to accumulate and promote further twisting adhesions formed following surgery or peritonitis,diseases of the intestines the intestines can be affected by various diseases causing inflammation infection and sometimes structural changes appendicitis inflammation from obstruction and infection of the appendix can lead to localized pain and severe cases may cause gangrene rupture or peritonitis microbial diseases typhoid and paratyphoid fever caused by salmonella typhi and salmonella paratyphi respectively leading to intestinal ulceration and complications like spleen enlargement and endocarditis gastroenteritis from pathogens like salmonella spp e coli and staphylococcus often linked to contaminated food causing diarrhea and dehydration cholera caused by vibrio cholerae resulting in severe dehydration dysentery infection with shigella or entamoeba histolytica leading to colon inflammation ulceration and sometimes chronic liver abscesses inflammatory bowel disease ibd crohns disease chronic patchy inflammation mainly in the ileum leading to malabsorption and a higher risk of cancer ulcerative colitis inflammation in the colon and rectum with mucosal ulceration and a longterm cancer risk diverticular disease diverticulosis is the formation of pouches in the colon often due to lowfiber diets inflamed diverticula diverticulitis can rupture and cause peritonitis intestinal tumors rare in the small intestine these tumors can obstruct blood flow or metastasize to organs
diseases of the pancreas acute pancreatitis proteolytic enzymes produced by the pancreas are secreted in inactive forms which are not activated until they reach the intestine this protects the pancreas from digestion by its own enzymes if these precursor enzymes are activated while still in the pancreas pancreatitis results the severity of the disease is directly related to the amount of pancreatic tissue destroyed mild forms may damage only those cells near the ducts severe forms cause widespread damage with necrosis and haemorrhage common complications include infection suppuration and local venous thrombosis pancreatic enzymes especially amylase enter and circulate in the blood causing similar damage to other structures in severe cases there is a high mortality rate the causes of acute pancreatitis are not clear but known predisposing factors are gallstones and alcoholism when a gallstone obstructs the hepatopancreatic ampulla there is reflux of bile into the pancreas and the spread of infection from cholangitis other associated conditions include cancer of the ampulla or head of pancreas virus infections notably mumps chronic renal failure renal transplantation hyperparathyroidism hypothermia drugs eg corticosteroids cytotoxic agents diabetes mellitus cholecystitis chronic pancreatitis this is due to repeated attacks of acute pancreatitis or may arise gradually without evidence of pancreatic disease it is frequently associated with fibrosis and distortion of the main pancreatic duct there is obstruction of the tiny acinar ducts by protein material secreted by the acinar cells this eventually leads to the formation of cysts which may rupture into the peritoneal cavity intact cysts may cause obstruction of the common bile duct causing jaundice portal vein causing venous congestion in the organs drained by its tributaries the causes of these changes are not known but they are associated mainly with heavy wine drinking cystic fibrosis mucoviscidosis this is one of the most common genetic diseases affecting 1 in 2500 babies it is estimated that almost 20 of people carry the abnormal recessive gene which must be present in both parents to cause the disease the secretions of all exocrine glands have abnormally high viscosity but the most severely affected are those of the pancreas intestines biliary tract lungs and the reproductive system in the male sweat glands secrete abnormally large amounts of salt during excessive sweating in the pancreas highly viscous mucus is secreted by the walls of the ducts and causes obstruction parenchymal cell damage the formation of cysts and defective enzyme secretion in the newborn intestinal obstruction may be caused by a plug of meconium and viscid mucus leading to perforation and meconium peritonitis which is often fatal in less acute cases there may be impairment of protein and fat digestion resulting in malabsorption steatorrhoea and failure to thrive in infants in older children digestion of food and absorption of nutrients is impaired there may be obstruction of bile ducts in the liver causing cirrhosis bronchitis bronchiectasis and pneumonia may develop the life span of affected individuals is likely to be less than 40 years the main treatments offered are aimed at controlling pulmonary infection chronic lung disease and cor pulmonale are the commonest causes of death tumours of the pancreas benign tumours of the pancreas are very rare malignant tumours these are relatively common and affect men more than women they occur most frequently in the head of the pancreas obstructing the flow of bile and pancreatic juice into the duodenum jaundice and acute pancreatitis usually develop weight loss is the result of impaired digestion and absorption of fat tumours in the body and tail of the gland rarely cause symptoms until the disease is advanced metastases are often recognised before the primary tumour the causes of the malignant changes are not known but it is believed that there may be an association with cigarette smoking diet high in fats and carbohydrates diabetes mellitus diseases of the liver new liver cells develop only when needed to replace damaged cells capacity for regeneration is considerable and damage is usually extensive before it is evident the effects of disease or toxic agents are seen when regeneration of hepatocytes liver cells does not keep pace with damage leading to hepatocellular failure there is a gradual replacement of damaged cells by fibrous tissue leading to portal hypertension in most liver disease both conditions are present acute hepatitis areas of necrosis develop as groups of hepatocytes die and the eventual outcome depends on the size and number of these areas causes of the damage may be a variety of conditions including viral infections toxic substances circulatory disturbances viral hepatitis virus infections are the commonest cause of acute liver injury and include type a type b and type c the types are distinguished serologically ie by the antibodies produced to combat the infection the severity of the ensuing disease caused by the different virus types varies considerably but the pattern is similar the viruses enter the liver cells causing degenerative changes by mechanisms not yet understood an inflammatory reaction ensues accompanied by production of an exudate containing lymphocytes plasma cells and granulocytes there is reactive hyperplasia of the hepatic macrophages kupffer cells in the walls of the sinusoids as groups of cells die necrotic areas of varying sizes develop phagocytes remove the necrotic material and the lobules collapse the basic lobule framework fig 1240 becomes distorted and blood vessels develop kinks these changes interfere with the circulation of blood to the remaining hepatocytes and the resultant hypoxia causes further damage fibrous tissue develops in the damaged area and adjacent hepatocytes proliferate the effect of these changes on the overall functioning of the liver depends on the size of the necrotic areas the amount of fibrous tissue formed and the extent to which the blood and bile channels are distorted type a virus infectious hepatitis this virus has only one known serological type it occurs endemically affecting mainly children causing a mild illness infection is spread by hands food water and fomites contaminated by infected faeces the incubation period is 15 to 40 days and the viruses are excreted in the faeces for 7 to 14 days before clinical symptoms appear and for about 7 days after antibodies develop and immunity persists after recovery subclinical disease may occur but carriers do not develop type b virus serum hepatitis this virus has a number of serological types infection occurs at any age but mostly in adults the incubation period is 50 to 180 days the virus enters the blood and is spread by blood and blood products people at greatest risk of infection are those who come in contact with blood and blood products in their daily work eg people in the health ambulance and fire services the virus is also spread by body fluids ie saliva semen vaginal secretions and from mother to fetus others at risk include intravenous drug addicts and male homosexuals antibodies are formed and immunity persists after recovery infection usually leads to severe illness lasting 2 to 6 weeks often followed by a protracted convalescence carriers may or may not have had clinical disease type b virus may cause massive liver necrosis and death in less severe cases recovery may be complete in chronic hepatitis which may develop live viruses continue to circulate in the blood and other body fluids the condition may predispose to liver cancer hepatitis c this virus is spread by blood and blood products it is prevalent in iv drug users and also occurs as a complication of blood transfusion the infection can be asymptomatic as a carrier state occurs when hepatitis develops it is often recurrent and may result in chronic liver disease especially cirrhosis toxic substances many drugs undergo chemical change in the liver before excretion in bile or by other organs they may damage the liver cells in their original form or while in various intermediate stages some substances always cause liver damage predictably toxic while others only do so when hypersensitivity develops unpredictably toxic in both types the extent of the damage depends on the size of the dose andor the duration of exposure box 121 circulatory disturbances the intensely active hepatocytes are particularly vulnerable to damage by hypoxia which is usually due to deficient blood supply caused by fibrosis in the liver following inflammation compression of the portal vein hepatic artery or vein by a tumour acute general circulatory failure and shock venous congestion caused by acute or chronic rightsided heart failure chronic hepatitis this is defined as any form of hepatitis which persists for more than 6 months it may be caused by viruses or drugs but in some cases the cause is unknown chronic persistent hepatitis this is a mild persistent inflammation following acute viral hepatitis there is usually little or no fibrosis chronic active hepatitis this is a continuing progressive inflammation with cell necrosis and the formation of fibrous tissue that may lead to cirrhosis of the liver there is distortion of the liver blood vessels and hypoxia leading to further hepatocyte damage this condition is commonly associated with type b virus hepatitis with some forms of autoimmunity and unpredictable drug reactions liver failure this occurs when liver function is reduced to such an extent that other body activities are impaired it may be acute or chronic and may be the outcome of a wide variety of disorders eg acute viral hepatitis extensive necrosis due to poisoning eg some drug overdoses hepatotoxic chemicals adverse drug reactions cirrhosis of the liver following some medical procedures eg abdominal paracentesis portacaval shunt operations liver failure has serious effects on other parts of the body hepatic encephalopathy the cells affected are the astrocytes in the brain the condition is characterised by apathy disorientation muscular rigidity delirium and coma several factors may be involved eg nitrogenous bacterial metabolites absorbed from the colon which are normally detoxified in the liver reach the brain via the blood other metabolites normally present in trace amounts eg ammonia may reach toxic concentrations and change the permeability of the cerebral blood vessels and the effectiveness of the bloodbrain barrier hypoxia and electrolyte imbalance blood coagulation defects the liver fails to synmesise substances needed for blood clotting ie prothrombin fibrinogen and factors ii v vii ix and x platelet production is impaired but the cause is unknown purpura and bleeding may occur oliguria and renal failure portal hypertension may cause the development of oesophageal varices if these rupture bleeding may lead to a fall in blood pressure sufficient to reduce the renal blood flow causing progressive oliguria and renal failure oedema and ascites these may be caused by the combination of two factors portal hypertension raises the capillary hydrostatic pressure in the organs drained by the tributaries of the portal vein fig 129 diminished production of serum albumin and clotting factors reduces the plasma osmotic pressure together these changes cause the movement of excess fluid into the interstitial spaces where it causes oedema eventually free fluid accumulates in the peritoneal cavity and the resultant ascites may be severe anaemia this is usually due to the combined effect of a number of factors upset in the metabolism of folic acid and vitamin b12 chronic blood loss from oesophageal varices causing iron deficiency anaemia increased breakdown of red blood cells in the congested spleen causing haemolytic anaemia jaundice the following factors may cause jaundice as liver failure develops inability of the hepatocytes to conjugate and excrete bilirubin obstruction to the movement of bile through the bile channels by fibrous tissue that has distorted the structural framework of liver lobules tumours of the liver benign tumours of the liver are very rare malignant tumours in many cases cancer of the liver is associated with cirrhosis but the relationship between them is not clear it may be that both cirrhosis and cancer are caused by the same agents or that the carcinogenic action of other agents is promoted by cirrhotic changes malignancy develops in a number of cases of acute hepatitis caused by type b virus the most common sites of metastases are the abdominal lymph nodes the peritoneum and the lungs secondary malignant tumours in the liver are common especially from primary tumours in the gastrointestinal tract the lungs and the breast the metastases tend to grow rapidly and are often the cause of death,diseases of the pancreas and liver pancreatic diseases acute pancreatitis occurs when pancreatic enzymes activate prematurely causing inflammation severe cases involve tissue necrosis and complications like infection and thrombosis common causes include gallstones and alcoholism chronic pancreatitis often results from repeated acute attacks or develops gradually it leads to fibrosis cyst formation and may obstruct the bile duct or portal vein causing jaundice or venous congestion cystic fibrosis a genetic disorder causing thick mucus secretion that obstructs pancreatic ducts affecting digestion and often leading to malnutrition pancreatic tumors malignant tumors often arise in the pancreass head causing bile obstruction jaundice and acute pancreatitis risk factors include smoking and highfat diets liver diseases acute hepatitis viral infections hepatitis a b c lead to liver cell necrosis symptoms and severity vary with potential for chronic infection and cirrhosis chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis prolonged liver inflammation can lead to cirrhosis where damaged cells are replaced by fibrous tissue disrupting blood flow and liver function liver failure severe liver damage causes systemic issues like jaundice coagulation defects and encephalopathy tumors liver cancer often associated with cirrhosis and hepatitis b can metastasize especially to abdominal and lung tissues
diseases of the gall bladder and bile ducts gallstones cholelithiasis gallstones consist of deposits of the constituents of bile most commonly cholesterol many small stones or one large stone may form the causes are not clear but predisposing factors include changes in the composition of bile that affect the solubility of its constituents high levels of blood and dietary cholesterol cholecystitis diabetes mellitus when associated with high blood cholesterol levels haemolytic disease female gender obesity longterm use of oral contraceptives several pregnancies in young women especially when accompanied by obesity complications biliary colic if a gallstone gets stuck in the cystic or common bile duct there is strong peristaltic contraction of the smooth muscle in the wall of the duct spasm in an effort to move the stone onwards the severe pain associated with biliary colic is due to ischaemia of the duct wall over the stone during the smooth muscle spasm inflammation gallstones cause irritation and inflammation of the walls of the gall bladder and the cystic and common bile ducts there may be superimposed microbial infection impaction blockage of the cystic duct by a gallstone leads to distension of the gall bladder and cholecystitis this does not cause jaundice because bile from the liver can still pass directly into the duodenum obstruction of the common bile duct leads to retention of bile jaundice and cholangitis infection of the bile ducts acute cholecystitis this is usually a complication of gallstones or an exacerbation of chronic cholecystitis especially if there has been partial or intermittent obstruction of the cystic duct inflammation develops followed by secondary microbial infections spread from a focus of infection elsewhere in the body eg they may be bloodborne or pass directly from the adjacent colon those most commonly involved are escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis in severe cases there may be fibrinous exudate into the gall bladder suppuration gangrene perforation peritonitis local abscess formation disruption of gall bladder activity gallstone formation and the infection may spread to the bile ducts and the liver chronic cholecystitis the onset is usually insidious sometimes following repeated acute attacks gallstones are usually present and there may be accompanying biliary colic pain is due to the spasmodic contraction of muscle causing ischaemia when the gall bladder is packed with gallstones there is usually secondary infection with suppuration ulceration of the tissues between the gall bladder and the duodenum or colon may occur with fistula formation and later fibrous adhesions tumours of the biliary tract benign tumours are rare malignant tumours these are relatively rare but when they do occur the most common sites are the neck of the gall bladder the junction of the cystic and bile ducts the ampulla of the bile duct local spread to the liver the pancreas and other adjacent organs is common lymph and blood spread lead to widespread metastases early sites include the liver lungs abdominal lymph nodes and the peritoneum jaundice this is not a disease in itself it is a sign of abnormal bilirubin metabolism and excretion bilirubin produced from the breakdown of haemoglobin is usually conjugated in the liver and excreted in the bile conjugation the process of adding certain groups to the bilirubin molecule makes it water soluble and greatly enhances its removal from the blood an essential step in excretion unconjugated bilirubin which is fat soluble has a toxic effect on brain cells however it is unable to cross the bloodbrain barrier until the plasma level rises above 340 umol1 but when it does it may cause neurological damage fits and mental handicap serum bilirubin may rise to 34 umol1 before the yellow colouration of jaundice is evident in the skin and conjunctiva normal 3 to 13 umol1 jaundice develops when there is an abnormality at some stage in the metabolic sequence caused by one or more factors eg excess haemolysis of red blood cells with the production of more bilirubin than the liver can deal with abnormal liver function that may cause incomplete uptake of unconjugated bilirubin by hepatocytes ineffective conjugation of bilirubin interference with bilirubin secretion into the bile obstruction to the flow of bile from the liver to the duodenum types of jaundice whatever stage in bilirubin processing is affected the end result is rising blood bilirubin levels haemolytic jaundice this is due to increased haemolysis of red blood cells in the spleen the amount of bilirubin is increased and if hypoxia develops the efficiency of hepatocyte activity is reduced neonatal haemolytic jaundice occurs in many babies especially in prematurity where the normal high haemolysis is coupled with shortage of conjugating enzymes in the hepatocytes obstructive jaundice obstruction to the flow of bile in the biliary tract is caused by eg gallstones tumour of the head of the pancreas fibrosis of the bile ducts following inflammation or injury by cholangitis or the passage of gallstones effects include pruritus caused by the irritating effects of bile salts on the skin pale faeces due to absence of stercobilin p 310 dark urine due to the presence of increased amounts of bilirubin hepatocellular jaundice this is the result of damage to the liver by eg viral infection toxic substances such as drugs amoebiasis amoebic dysentery cirrhosis of the liver the damaged hepatocytes may be unable to remove unconjugated bilirubin from the blood or conjugate bilirubin or secrete conjugated bilirubin into bile canaliculi,diseases of the gall bladder bile ducts and jaundice gallstones cholelithiasis form from bile components often cholesterol with risk factors like high cholesterol diabetes and obesity complications include biliary colic severe pain from muscle spasms around a stone in the bile ducts inflammation stones can inflame the gall bladder and ducts potentially leading to infection impaction gallstones blocking the cystic duct cause cholecystitis common duct obstruction leads to jaundice and cholangitis cholecystitis may be acute often from infection and gallstones or chronic with repeated acute episodes and infection rare malignant tumors in the gall bladder or ducts may spread to the liver pancreas and beyond jaundice results from abnormal bilirubin metabolism normally bilirubin from red cell breakdown is conjugated in the liver and excreted types include haemolytic jaundice increased red cell destruction overwhelms the liver obstructive jaundice bile duct blockages from stones or tumors lead to pruritus pale stools and dark urine hepatocellular jaundice liver cell damage eg infection cirrhosis prevents bilirubin processing
the urinary system the urinary system is one of the excretory systems of the body it consists of the following structures 2 kidneys which secrete urine 2 ureters which convey the urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder urinary bladder where urine collects and is temporarily stored 1 urethra through which the urine is discharged from the urinary bladder to the exterior figure 131 shows an overview of the urinary system the urinary system plays a vital part in maintaining homeostasis of water and electrolyte concentrations within the body the kidneys produce urine that contains metabolic waste products including the nitrogenous compounds urea and uric acid excess ions and some drugs the main functions of the kidneys are formation and secretion of urine production and secretion of erythropoietin the hormone responsible for controlling the rate of formation of red blood cells p 63 production and secretion of renin an important enzyme in the control of blood pressure p 223 urine is stored in the bladder and excreted by the process of micturition kidneys the kidneys fig 132 lie on the posterior abdominal wall one on each side of the vertebral column behind the peritoneum and below the diaphragm they extend from the level of the 12th thoracic vertebra to the 3rd lumbar vertebra receiving some protection from the lower rib cage the right kidney is usually slightly lower than the left probably because of the considerable space occupied by the liver kidneys are beanshaped organs about 11 cm long 6 cm wide 3 cm thick and weigh 150 g they are embedded in and held in position by a mass of fat a sheath of fibroelastic renal fascia encloses the kidney and the renal fat organs associated with the kidneys figs 131 132 and 133 as the kidneys lie on either side of the vertebral column each is associated with a different group of structures right kidney superiorly the right adrenal gland anteriorly the right lobe of the liver the duodenum and the hepatic flexure of the colon posteriorly the diaphragm and muscles of the posterior abdominal wall left kidney superiorly the left adrenal gland anteriorly the spleen stomach pancreas jejunum and splenic flexure of the colon posteriorly the diaphragm and muscles of the posterior abdominal wall gross structure of the kidney there are three areas of tissue which can be distinguished when a longitudinal section of the kidney is viewed with the naked eye fig 134 a fibrous capsule surrounding the kidney the cortex a reddishbrown layer of tissue immediately below the capsule and outside the pyramids the medulla the innermost layer consisting of pale conicalshaped striations the renal pyramids the hilum is the concave medial border of the kidney where the renal blood and lymph vessels the ureter and nerves enter the renal pelvis is the funnelshaped structure which acts as a receptacle for the urine formed by the kidney fig 134 it has a number of distal branches called calyces each of which surrounds the apex of a renal pyramid urine formed in the kidney passes through a papilla at the apex of a pyramid into a minor calyx then into a major calyx before passing through the pelvis into the ureter the walls of the pelvis contain smooth muscle and are lined with transitional epithelium peristalsis of the smooth muscle originating in pacemaker cells in the walls of the calyces propels urine through the pelvis and ureters to the bladder this is an intrinsic property of the smooth muscle and is not under nerve control microscopic structure of the kidney the kidney is composed of about 1 million functional units the nephrons and a smaller number of collecting tubules the collecting tubules transport urine through the pyramids to the renal pelvis giving them their striped appearance the tubules are supported by a small amount of connective tissue containing blood vessels nerves and lymph vessels the nephron fig 135 the nephron consists of a tubule closed at one end the other end opening into a collecting tubule the closed or blind end is indented to form the cupshaped glomerular capsule bowmans capsule which almost completely encloses a network of arterial capillaries the glomerulus continuing from the glomerular capsule the remainder of the nephron is about 3 cm long and is described in three parts the proximal convoluted tubule the medullary loop loop of henle the distal convoluted tubule leading into a collecting duct the collecting ducts unite forming larger ducts that empty into the minor calyces after entering the kidney at the hilum the renal artery divides into smaller arteries and arterioles in the cortex an arteriole the afferent arteriole enters each glomerular capsule then subdivides into a cluster of capillaries forming the glomerulus between the capillary loops there are connective tissue phagocytic mesangial cells which are part of the reticuloendothelial system p 66 the blood vessel leading away from the glomerulus is the efferent arteriole it breaks up into a second capillary network to supply oxygen and nutrients to the remainder of the nephron venous blood drained from this capillary bed eventually leaves the kidney in the renal vein which empties into the inferior vena cava fig 136 the blood pressure in the glomerulus is higher than in other capillaries because the diameter of the afferent arteriole is greater than that of the efferent arteriole the walls of the glomerulus and the glomerular capsule consist of a single layer of flattened epithelial cells fig 137 the glomerular walls are more permeable than those of other capillaries the remainder of the nephron and the collecting tubule are formed by a single layer of highly specialised cells the nerve supply to the blood vessels of the kidney consists of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves the presence of both branches of the autonomic nervous system permits control of renal blood vessel diameter and renal blood flow independently of autoregulation functions of the kidney formation of urine the kidneys form urine which passes through the ureters to the bladder for storage prior to excretion the composition of urine reflects the activities of the nephrons in the maintenance of homeostasis waste products of protein metabolism are excreted electrolyte balance is maintained and the ph acidbase balance is maintained by the excretion of hydrogen ions there are three processes involved in the formation of urine simple filtration selective reabsorption secretion simple filtration fig 138 filtration takes place through the semipermeable walls of the glomerulus and glomerular capsule water and a large number of small molecules pass through although some are reabsorbed later blood cells plasma proteins and other large molecules are unable to filter through and remain in the capillaries see box 131 the filtrate in the glomerulus is very similar in composition to plasma with the important exception of plasma proteins filtration is assisted by the difference between the blood pressure in the glomerulus and the pressure of the filtrate in the glomerular capsule because the diameter of the efferent arteriole is less than that of the afferent arteriole a capillary hydrostatic pressure of about 73 kpa 55 mmhg builds up in the glomerulus this pressure is opposed by the osmotic pressure of the blood about 4 kpa 30 mmhg and by filtrate hydrostatic pressure of about 2 kpa 15 mmhg in the glomerular capsule the net filtration pressure is therefore 73 4 2 13 kpa or 55 30 15 10 mmhg the volume of filtrate formed by both kidneys each minute is called the glomerular filtration rate gfr in a healthy adult the gfr is about 125 mlmin ie 180 litres of dilute filtrate are formed each day by the two kidneys most of the filtrate is reabsorbed with less than 1 ie 1 to 15 litres excreted as urine the difference in volume and concentration is due to selective reabsorption of some constituents of the filtrate and tubular secretion of others autoregulation of filtration renal blood flow is protected by a mechanism called autoregulation whereby renal blood flow is maintained at a constant pressure across a wide range of systolic blood pressures from 80 to 200 mmhg autoregulation operates independently of nervous control ie if the nerve supply to the renal blood vessels is interrupted autoregulation continues to operate it is therefore a property inherent in renal blood vessels it may be stimulated by changes in blood pressure in the renal arteries or by fluctuating levels of certain metabolites eg prostaglandins in severe shock when the systolic blood pressure falls below 80 mmhg autoregulation fails and renal blood flow and the hydrostatic pressure decrease impairing filtration within the nephrons selective reabsorption fig 139 selective reabsorption is the process by which the composition and volume of the glomerular filtrate are altered during its passage through the convoluted tubules the medullary loop and the collecting tubule the general purpose of this process is to reabsorb into the blood those filtrate constituents needed by the body to maintain fluid and electrolyte balance and the ph of the blood active transport is carried out at carrier sites in the epithelial membrane using chemical energy to transport substances against their concentration gradients p 34 some constituents of glomerular filtrate eg glucose amino acids do not normally appear in urine because they are completely reabsorbed unless they are present in blood in excessive quantities the kidneys maximum capacity for reabsorption of a substance is the transport maximum or renal threshold eg normal blood glucose level is 25 to 53 mmoll 45 to 95 mg100 ml if the level rises above the transport maximum of about 9 mmol1 160 mg100 ml glucose appears in the urine because all the carrier sites are occupied and the mechanism for active transfer out of the tubules is overloaded other substances reabsorbed by active transport include amino acids and sodium calcium potassium phosphate and chloride some ions eg sodium and chloride can be absorbed by both active and passive mechanisms depending on the site in the nephron the transport maximum or renal threshold of some substances varies according to the bodys need for them at the time and in some cases reabsorption is regulated by hormones parathyroid hormone from the parathyroid glands and calcitonin from the thyroid gland together regulate reabsorption of calcium and phosphate antidiuretic hormone adh from the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland increases the permeability of the distal convoluted tubules and collecting tubules increasing water reabsorption fig 1310 aldosterone secreted by the adrenal cortex increases the reabsorption of sodium and excretion of potassium fig 1311 nitrogenous waste products such as urea and uric acid are reabsorbed only to a slight extent substances that are not normal blood constituents are not reabsorbed if the blood passes through the glomerulus too quickly for filtration to clear such substances from the blood the tubules secrete them into the filtrate secretion fig 139 filtration occurs as the blood flows through the glomerulus substances not required and foreign materials eg drugs including penicillin and aspirin may not be cleared from the blood by filtration because of the short time it remains in the glomerulus such substances are cleared by secretion into the convoluted tubules and excreted from the body in the urine tubular secretion of hydrogen h ions is important in maintaining homeostasis of blood ph composition of urine water 96 urea 2 uric acid creatinine ammonia sodium potassium 2 chlorides phosphates sulphates oxalates urine is clear and amber in colour due to the presence of urobilin a bile pigment altered in the intestine reabsorbed then excreted by the kidneys see fig 1243 p 314 the specific gravity is between 1020 and 1030 and the ph is around 6 normal range of 45 to 8 a healthy adult passes 1000 to 1500 ml per day the amount of urine produced and the specific gravity vary according to the fluid intake and the amount of solute excreted during sleep and muscular exercise urine production is decreased water balance and urine output water is taken into the body through the alimentary tract and a small amount called metabolic water is formed by the metabolic processes water is excreted in saturated expired air as a constituent of the faeces through the skin as sweat and as the main constituent of urine the amount lost in expired air and in the faeces is fairly constant and the amount of sweat produced is associated with the maintenance of normal body temperature p 365 the balance between fluid intake and output is therefore controlled by the kidneys the minimum urinary output ie the smallest volume required to excrete the bodys waste products is about 500 ml per day the amount produced in excess of this is controlled mainly by antidiuretic hormone adh released into the blood by the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland there is a close link between the posterior pituitary and the hypothalamus in the brain see fig 93a and b p 216 sensory nerve cells in the hypothalamus osmoreceptors detect changes in the osmotic pressure of the blood nerve impulses from the osmoreceptors stimulate the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland to release adh when the osmotic pressure is raised adh output is increased and as a result water reabsorption by the cells in distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts is increased reducing the blood osmotic pressure and adh output this feedback mechanism maintains the blood osmotic pressure and therefore sodium and water concentrations within normal limits fig 1310 the feedback mechanism may be opposed when there is an excessive amount of a dissolved substance in the blood for example in diabetes mellitus when the blood glucose level is above the transport maximum of the renal tubules excess water is excreted with the excess glucose this polyuria may lead to dehydration in spite of increased production of adh but it is usually accompanied by acute thirst and increased water intake electrolyte balance changes in the concentration of electrolytes in the body fluids may be due to changes in the body water content or electrolyte levels there are several mechanisms that maintain the balance between water and electrolyte concentration,the urinary system a critical excretory system includes two kidneys two ureters a bladder and a urethra this system maintains body homeostasis by regulating water electrolytes and waste removal the kidneys filter blood producing urine which contains nitrogenous wastes excess ions and toxins key functions of the kidneys involve urine formation erythropoietin secretion stimulates red blood cell production and renin production regulates blood pressure kidney structure located on each side of the spine kidneys are beanshaped and protected by ribs internally they consist of a fibrous capsule cortex medulla renal pyramids and a hilum where blood vessels and nerves enter the nephron the kidneys functional unit has a glomerular capsule surrounding a glomerulus and includes the proximal convoluted tubule loop of henle and distal convoluted tubule urine formation urine forms through filtration blood filters through the glomerulus removing small molecules selective reabsorption needed molecules reenter the bloodstream secretion unneeded substances enter the tubules for excretion water and electrolyte balance are regulated by hormones eg adh aldosterone and the feedback mechanisms involving the hypothalamus and pituitary gland
ureters the ureters are the tubes that convey urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder fig 1312 they are about 25 to 30 cm long with a diameter of about 3 mm the ureter is continuous with the funnelshaped renal pelvis it passes downwards through the abdominal cavity behind the peritoneum in front of the psoas muscle into the pelvic cavity and passes obliquely through the posterior wall of the bladder fig 1313 because of this arrangement when urine accumulates and the pressure in the bladder rises the ureters are compressed and the openings occluded this prevents reflux of urine into the ureters towards the kidneys as the bladder fills and during micturition when pressure increases as the muscular bladder wall contracts structure the ureters consist of three layers of tissue an outer covering of fibrous tissue continuous with the fibrous capsule of the kidney a middle muscular layer consisting of interlacing smooth muscle fibres that form a syncytium spiralling round the ureter some in clockwise and some in anticlockwise directions and an additional outer longitudinal layer in the lower third an inner layer the mucosa lined with transitional epithelium function the ureters propel the urine from the kidneys into the bladder by peristaltic contraction of the smooth muscle layer this is an intrinsic property of the smooth muscle and is not under autonomic nerve control the waves of contraction originate in a pacemaker in the minor calyces peristaltic waves occur several times per minute increasing in frequency with the volume of urine produced and send little spurts of urine into the bladder urinary bladder the urinary bladder is a reservoir for urine it lies in the pelvic cavity and its size and position vary depending on the amount of urine it contains when distended the bladder rises into the abdominal cavity structure fig 1315 the bladder is roughly pearshaped but becomes more oval as it fills with urine it has anterior superior and posterior surfaces the posterior surface is the base the bladder opens into the urethra at its lowest point the neck the peritoneum covers only the superior surface before it turns upwards as the parietal peritoneum lining the anterior abdominal wall posteriorly it surrounds the uterus in the female and the rectum in the male the bladder wall is composed of three layers the outer layer of loose connective tissue containing blood and lymphatic vessels and nerves covered on the upper surface by the peritoneum the middle layer consisting of a mass of interlacing smooth muscle fibres and elastic tissue loosely arranged in three layers this is called the detrusor muscle and it empties the bladder when it contracts the mucosa lined with transitional epithelium p 36 when the bladder is empty the inner lining is arranged in folds or rugae and these gradually disappear as the bladder fills the bladder is distensible but when it contains 300 to 400 ml the awareness of the desire to urinate is initiated the total capacity is rarely more than about 600 ml the three orifices in the bladder wall form a triangle or trigone fig 1315 the upper two orifices on the posterior wall are the openings of the ureters the lower orifice is the point of origin of the urethra where the urethra commences is a thickening of the smooth muscle layer forming the internal urethml sphincter this sphincter is not under voluntary control urethra the urethra is a canal extending from the neck of the bladder to the exterior at the external urethral orifice its length differs in the male and in the female the male urethra is associated with the urinary and the reproductive systems and is described in chapter 19 the female urethra is approximately 4 cm long it runs downwards and forwards behind the symphysis pubis and opens at the external urethral orifice just in front of the vagina the external urethral orifice is guarded by the external urethral sphincter which is under voluntary control except during the passage of urine the walls of the urethra are in close apposition the male urethra is described in detail in chapter 19 but in both sexes the basic structure is the same its walls consist of three layers of tissue the muscle layer continuous with that of the bladder at its origin there is the internal urethral sphincter consisting mainly of elastic tissue and smooth muscle fibres under autonomic nerve control slow and continuous contraction of this sphincter keeps the urethra closed in the middle third there is skeletal muscle surrounding the urethra under voluntary nerve control that forms the external urethral sphincter the submucosa a spongy layer containing blood vessels and nerves the mucosa which is continuous with that of the bladder in the upper part in the lower part the lining consists of stratified squamous epithelium continuous externally with the skin of the vulva micturition the urinary bladder acts as a reservoir for urine when 300 to 400 ml of urine have accumulated afferent autonomic nerve fibres in the bladder wall sensitive to stretch are stimulated in the infant this initiates a spinal reflex action see p 159 and micturition occurs fig 1316 micturition occurs when autonomic efferent fibres convey impulses to the bladder causing contraction of the detrusor muscle and relaxation of the internal urethral sphincter when the nervous system is fully developed the micturition reflex is stimulated but sensory impulses pass upwards to the brain and there is an awareness of the desire to pass urine by conscious effort reflex contraction of the bladder wall and relaxation of the internal sphincter can be inhibited for a limited period of time fig 1317 in adults micturition occurs when the detrusor muscle contracts and there is reflex relaxation of the internal sphincter and voluntary relaxation of the external sphincter it can be assisted by increasing the pressure within the pelvic cavity achieved by lowering the diaphragm and contracting the abdominal muscles valsalvas manoeuvre overdistension of the bladder is extremely painful and when this stage is reached there is a tendency for involuntary relaxation of the external sphincter to occur and a small amount of urine to escape provided there is no mechanical obstruction,the ureters are tubes about 2530 cm long and 3 mm in diameter that transport urine from the kidneys to the bladder they pass down through the abdominal cavity and enter the bladder obliquely which prevents urine backflow as bladder pressure increases during filling or micturition each ureter has three layers outer fibrous tissue a middle layer of smooth muscle for peristalsis and an inner mucosa lined with transitional epithelium the urinary bladder is a distensible reservoir in the pelvic cavity that holds up to 600 ml of urine typically triggering the urge to urinate at 300400 ml the bladder wall consists of connective tissue detrusor muscle smooth muscle that contracts during urination and mucosa with folds rugae that expand as it fills three orifices in the bladder form the trigone two ureter openings and the urethral opening which contains the internal sphincter involuntary control the urethra is a canal extending from the bladder to the exterior with a length of about 4 cm in females its walls have three layers including muscle with internal involuntary and external voluntary sphincters allowing controlled urination micturition urination is a reflex that contracts the detrusor muscle and relaxes the internal sphincter in adults voluntary control of the external sphincter allows urination to be delayed briefly
diseases of the kidneys glomerulonephritis gn this term suggests inflammatory conditions of the glomerulus but there are several types of gn and inflammatory changes are not always present in many cases immune complexes damage the glomeruli these are formed when antigens and antibodies combine either within the kidney or elsewhere in the body and they circulate in the blood when immune complexes lodge in the walls of the glomeruli they often cause an inflammatory response that impairs glomerular function other immune mechanisms are also implicated in gn classification of gn is complex and based on a number of features the cause immunological characteristics and findings on microscopy microscopic distinction is based on the extent of damage diffuse affecting all glomeruli focal affecting some glomeruli appearance proliferative increased number of cells in the glomeruli membranous thickening of the glomerular basement membrane effects of glomerulonephritis these depend on the type and are listed below haematuria this is usually painless and not accompanied by other symptoms when microscopic it may be found on routine urinalysis when red blood cells have passed from the damaged glomeruli into the filtrate asymptomatic proteinuria this may also be found on routine urinalysis and when it is of a low level does not cause nephrotic syndrome it occurs as protein passes through the damaged glomeruli into the filtrate acute nephritis this is characterised by the presence of anuria or oliguria hypertension haematuria fluid retention uraemia loin pain headache and malaise are also common nephrotic syndrome see below chronic renal failure this occurs when nephrons are progressively and irreversibly damaged after the renal reserve is lost nephrotic syndrome this is not a disease in itself but is an important feature of several kidney diseases the main characteristics are marked proteinuria hypoalbuminaemia generalised oedema hyperlipidaemia when glomeruli are damaged the permeability of the glomerular membrane is increased and plasma proteins pass through in the filtrate albumin is the main protein lost because it is the most common and is the smallest of the plasma proteins when the daily loss exceeds the rate of production by the liver there is a significant fall in the total plasma protein level the consequent low plasma osmotic pressure leads to widespread oedema and reduced plasma volume see fig 557 p 119 this reduces the renal blood flow and stimulates the reninangiotensinaldosterone mechanism causing increased reabsorption of water and sodium from the renal tubules the reabsorbed water further reduces the osmotic pressure increasing the oedema the key factor is the loss of albumin across the glomerular membrane and as long as this continues the vicious circle is perpetuated fig 1318 levels of nitrogenous waste products ie uric acid urea and creatinine usually remain normal hyperlipidaemia especially hypercholesterolaemia also occurs but the cause is unknown the nephrotic syndrome occurs in a number of diseases in children the most common cause is minimalchange glomerulonephritis in adults it may complicate most forms of glomerulonephritis diabetes mellitus systemic lupus erythematosus infections eg malaria infective endocarditis syphilis hepatitis b drugs treatment eg penicillamine gold captopril phenytoin diabetic kidney renal failure is the cause of death in 10 of all diabetics and up to 50 of cases of the insulindependent type i diabetes mellitus p 236 there is damage to large and small blood vessels in many parts of the body the effects include progressive glomerulosclerosis followed by atrophy of the tubules acute pyelonephritis with papillary necrosis atheroma of the renal arteries and their branches leading to renal ischaemia and hypertension ch 5 nephrotic syndrome hypertension and the kidneys essential and secondary hypertension p 126 both affect the kidneys when there is renal arteriosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis causing ischaemia the reduced blood flow stimulates the reninangiotensinaldosterone mechanism fig 1311 raising the blood pressure still further essential hypertension benign hypertension this causes gradual and progressive sclerosis and fibrosis of the glomeruli leading to renal failure or more commonly to malignant hypertension malignant hypertension this causes rapidly developing arteriolosclerosis which spreads to the glomeruli with subsequent destruction of nephrons leading to further rise in blood pressure reduction in renal blood flow and the amount of filtrate increased permeability of the glomeruli with the passage of plasma proteins and red blood cells into the filtrate resulting in proteinuria and haematuria progressive oliguria and renal failure secondary hypertension this is caused by longstanding kidney diseases such as chronic glomerulonephritis and pyelonephritis and leads to chronic renal ischaemia further hypertension and renal failure acute pyelonephritis this is an acute microbial infection of the renal pelvis and calyces spreading to the kidney substance causing formation of small abscesses the infection may travel up the urinary tract from the perineum or be bloodborne it is accompanied by fever malaise and loin pain ascending infection upward spread of microbes from the bladder see cystitis p 357 is the most common cause of this condition reflux of infected urine into the ureters when the bladder contracts during micturition predisposes to upward spread of infection to the renal pelves and kidney substance bloodborne infection the source of microbes may be from septicaemia or elsewhere in the body eg respiratory tract infections infected wounds or abscesses when the infection spreads into the kidney tissue it causes suppuration and destruction of nephrons the prognosis depends on the amount of healthy kidney remaining after the infection subsides necrotic tissue is eventually replaced by fibrous tissue but there may be some hypertrophy of healthy nephrons there are a number of outcomes healing recurrence especially if there is a structural abnormality of the urinary tract and chronic pyelonephritis perinephric abscess and papillary necrosis are complications usually if the condition is untreated chronic pyelonephritis this usually follows repeated attacks of acute pyelonephritis with scar tissue formation it is usually associated with reflux of urine from the bladder to the ureter enabling microbes to gain access to the kidneys a congenital abnormality of the angle of insertion of the ureter into the bladder often predisposes to the reflux of urine but it is sometimes caused by an obstruction that develops later in life the progressive loss of functioning nephrons leads to chronic renal failure and uraemia concurrent hypertension is common acute renal failure there is a sudden and severe reduction in the glomerular filtration rate and kidney function that is usually reversible over days or weeks when treated this occurs as a complication of a variety of conditions not necessarily associated with the kidneys the causes of acute renal failure are classified as prerenol the result of reduced renal blood flow especially severe and prolonged shock renal or parenchymal damage to the kidney itself due to eg acute tubular necrosis glomerulonephritis postrenal obstruction to the outflow of urine eg tumour of the bladder uterus or cervix large calculus in the renal pelvis acute tubular necrosis atn this is the most common cause of acute renal failure there is severe damage to the tubular epithelial cells caused by ischaemia or nephrotoxicity ischaemic atn this is caused by severe and prolonged shock due to eg haemorrhage severe trauma marked dehydration acute intestinal obstruction prolonged and complicated surgical procedures extensive burns nephrotoxic atm this is caused by toxic chemicals eg carbon tetrachloride used in dry cleaning chromic acid ethylene glycol antifreeze mercurial compounds ionising radiation drugs eg trilene aminoglycosides paracetamol overdose endogenous substances eg myoglobin from damaged muscle haemoglobin from incompatible blood transfusion oliguria less than 400 ml of urine per day in adults severe oliguria less than 100 ml of urine per day in adults or anuria absence of urine may last for a few weeks followed by diuresis there is reduced glomerular filtration and tubular selective reabsorption and secretion leading to generalised and pulmonary oedema accumulation of urea uraemia and other metabolic waste products electrolyte imbalance which may be exacerbated by the retention of potassium hyperkalaemia released from cells following severe injury and extensive tissue damage elsewhere in the body acidosis due to disrupted excretion of hydrogen ions profound diuresis the diuretic phase occurs during the healing process when the epithelial cells of the tubules have regenerated but are still incapable of selective reabsorption and secretion diuresis may lead to acute dehydration complicating the existing high plasma urea acidosis and electrolyte imbalance if the patient survives the initial acute phase a considerable degree of renal function is usually restored over a period of months chronic renal failure this is reached when irreversible damage to nephrons is so severe that 75 of renal function has been lost and the kidneys cannot function effectively the main causes are glomerulonephritis diabetes mellitus chronic pyelonephritis and hypertension the effects are reduced glomerular filtration rate selective reabsorption and secretion and glomerular fibrosis which interferes with blood flow these changes have a number of effects on the body uraemia develops after about 7 days of anuria because of the reduced glomerular filtration rate and impaired tubular secretion of urea increased blood urea usually leads to confusion and mental disorientation polyuria is caused by defective reabsorption of water in spite of the reduced glomerular filtration rate gfr table 132 this may cause nocturia thirst and polydipsia fixed specific gravity the specific gravity of the urine is similar to that of glomerular filtrate ie about 1010 normal 1020 to 1030 it remains low and fixed because of defective tubular reabsorption of water acidosis control of the ph of body fluids is lost mainly because the tubules fail to remove hydrogen ions by forming ammonia and hydrogen phosphates electrolyte imbalance occurs as tubular reabsorption and secretion are impaired anaemia caused by deficiency of the hormone erythropoietin occurs when the chronic state extends over a period of months and is usually exacerbated by dialysis it results in fatigue dyspnoea and cardiac failure hypertension is often a consequence if not the cause of renal failure anorexia nausea and very deep kussmauls respirations occur as uraemia progresses in the later stages there may also be hiccoughs vomiting muscle twitching confusion drowsiness and coma renal calculi calculi stones form in the kidneys and bladder when urinary constituents normally in solution are precipitated the solutes involved are oxalates phosphates urates and uric acid and stones usually consist of more than one substance deposited in layers they are more common in males and after 30 years of age most originate in collecting tubules or in renal papillae they then pass into the renal pelvis where they may increase in size some become too large to pass through the ureter and may obstruct the outflow of urine causing renal failure others pass to the bladder and are either excreted or increase in size and obstruct the urethra sometimes stones originate in the bladder usually in developing countries and often in children predisposing factors include dehydration this leads to increased reabsorption of water from the tubules but does not change solute reabsorption resulting in a reduced volume of highly concentrated filtrate in the collecting tubules ph of urine when the normally acid filtrate becomes alkaline some substances may be precipitated eg phosphates this occurs when the kidney buffering system is defective and in some infections infection necrotic material and pus provide foci upon which solutes in the filtrate may be deposited and the products of infection may alter the ph of the urine infection sometimes leads to alkaline urine see above metabolic conditions these include hyperparathyroidism and gout small calculi these may pass through or become impacted in a ureter and damage the epithelium leading to haematuria then fibrosis and stricture in ureteric obstruction usually unilateral there is spasmodic contraction of the ureter causing acute intermittent ischaemic pain renal colic as the ureter contracts over the stone stones reaching the bladder may be passed in urine or increase in size and eventually obstruct the urethra consequences include retention of urine and bilateral hydronephrosis infection proximal to the blockage pyelonephritis and severe kidney damage large calculi staghorn calculus one large stone may form filling the renal pelvis and the calyces fig 1319 it causes stagnation of urine predisposing to infection hydronephrosis and occasionally kidney tumours it may cause chronic renal failure,kidney diseases glomerulonephritis gn inflammation of the glomeruli often caused by immune complexes damaging glomerular structures gn presents as haematuria proteinuria acute nephritis or chronic renal failure with types like diffuse focal proliferative and membranous nephrotic syndrome marked by proteinuria hypoalbuminemia edema and hyperlipidemia increased glomerular permeability leads to protein loss and fluid retention its seen in diseases like diabetes and lupus diabetic kidney disease damage to kidney blood vessels in diabetes causes glomerulosclerosis pyelonephritis renal artery atheroma and nephrotic syndrome potentially leading to renal failure hypertension both benign and malignant hypertension damage glomeruli malignant hypertension rapidly worsens causing proteinuria haematuria and renal failure pyelonephritis acute microbial infection in the renal pelvis and calyces often ascending from the urinary tract causes fever and loin pain chronic pyelonephritis linked to urinary reflux or obstruction leads to scar tissue and chronic renal failure renal calculi crystalline stones from solutes like oxalates form in kidneys caused by dehydration infection or metabolic issues small stones may pass or obstruct large ones staghorn calculi lead to hydronephrosis and kidney damage
diseases of the renal pelvis ureters bladder and urethra these structures are considered together because their combined functions are to collect and store urine prior to excretion from the body obstruction and infection are the main causes of dysfunction obstruction to the outflow of urine hydronephrosis this is dilatation of the renal pelvis and calyces caused by accumulation of urine it leads to destruction of the nephrons fibrosis and atrophy of the kidney one or both kidneys may be involved depending on the cause and site when there is an abnormality of the bladder or urethra both kidneys are affected whereas an obstruction above the bladder is more common and affects only one kidney fig 1319 complete sustained obstruction in this condition hydronephrosis develops quickly pressure in the nephrons rises and urine production stops the most common causes are a large calculus or tumour the outcome depends on whether one or both kidneys are involved homeostasis can be maintained by one kidney partial or intermittent obstruction this may lead to progressive hydronephrosis caused by eg a succession of renal calculi in a ureter eventually moved onwards by peristalsis a calculus that partially blocks the ureter constriction of a ureter or the urethra by fibrous tissue following epithelial inflammation caused by the passage of a stone or by infection a tumour in the urinary tract or in the abdominal or pelvic cavity enlarged prostate gland in the male spinal lesions the immediate effect of transverse spinal cord lesions that damage the nerve supply to the bladder is that micturition does not occur when the bladder fills the rise in pressure causes overflow incontinence back pressure into the ureters and hydronephrosis reflex micturition is usually reestablished after a time but loss of voluntary control may be irreversible pressure on the spinal cord and other abnormalities eg spina bifida can also impair micturition complications of urinary tract obstruction infection stasis of urine predisposes to infection and pyelonephritis the microbes usually spread upwards in the urinary tract or are sometimes bloodborne calculus formation infection and urinary stasis predispose to calculus formation when the ph of urine changes from acid to alkaline promoting the precipitation of some solutes eg phosphates cell debris and pus provide foci upon which solutes in the urine may be deposited infections of the urinary tract infection of any part of the tract may spread upwards causing pyelonephritis p 353 and severe kidney damage ureteritis inflammation of a ureter is usually due to the upward spread of infection in cystitis acute cystitis this is inflammation of the bladder and may be due to spread of microbes that are commensals of the bowel escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis from the perineum especially in women because of the short wide urethra its proximity to the anus and the moist perineal conditions a mixed infection of coliform and other organisms which may follow the passage of a urinary catheter or other instrument inflammation in the absence of microbes eg following radiotherapy or passage of a catheter or other instrument the effects are inflammation with oedema and small haemorrhages of the mucosa which may be accompanied by haematuria there is hypersensitivity of the sensory nerve endings in the bladder wall which are stimulated before the bladder has filled leading to frequency of micturition and dysuria a burning sensation on micturition the urine may appear cloudy and have an unpleasant smell lower abdominal pain often accompanies cystitis predisposing factors the most important predisposing factors are coliform microbes in the perineal region and stasis of urine in the bladder during sexual intercourse there may be trauma to the urethra and transfer of hormones associated with pregnancy cause relaxation of perineal muscle and relaxation and kinking of the ureters towards the end of pregnancy pressure caused by the fetus may obstruct the outflow of urine in the male prostatitis provides a focus of local infection or an enlarged prostate gland may cause progressive urethral obstruction chronic cystitis this may follow repeated attacks of acute cystitis it occurs most commonly in males over 60 years of age when compression of the urethra by an enlarged prostate gland prevents the bladder from emptying completely calculus formation is common especially if the normally acid urine becomes alkaline due to microbial action or kidney damage urethritis this is inflammation of the urethra a common cause is neisseria gonorrhoeae gonococcus spread by sexual intercourse directly to the urethra in the male and indirectly from the perineum in the female many cases of urethritis have no known cause ie nonspecific urethritis ch 19 tumours of the bladder it is not always clear whether bladder tumours are benign or malignant tumours are often multiple and recurrence is common the causes of both types are not known but predisposing factors include cigarette smoking taking high doses of analgesics over a long period and exposure to chemicals used in some industries eg manufacture of aniline dyes rubber industry benzidinebased industries papillomas these tumours arise from transitional epithelium and are usually benign they consist of a stalk with finebranching fronds which tend to break off causing painless bleeding and haematuria papillomas commonly recur even when they are benign although the cells are well differentiated some papillomas behave as carcinomas and invade surrounding blood and lymph vessels solid tumours these are all malignant to some degree at an early stage the more malignant and solid tumours rapidly invade the bladder wall and spread in lymph and blood to other parts of the body if the surface ulcerates there may be haemorrhage and necrosis urinary incontinence in this condition there is involuntary passage of urine due to defective voluntary control of the external urethral sphincter stress incontinence this is leakage of urine when intraabdominal pressure is raised eg on coughing laughing sneezing or lifting it usually affects women when there is weakness of the muscles of the pelvic floor or pelvic ligaments eg after childbirth or as part of the ageing process retention and overflow incontinence this occurs when there is retention of urine due to obstruction of urinary outflow eg enlarged prostate or urethral stricture a neurological abnormality affecting the nerves involved in micturition eg stroke spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis the bladder becomes distended and when the pressure inside overcomes the resistance of the urethral sphincter urine dribbles from the urethra the individual may be unable to initiate andor maintain micturition urge incontinence leakage of urine follows a sudden and intense urge to void and may be due to a urinary tract infection calculus tumour or sudden stress,diseases of the renal pelvis ureters bladder and urethra obstruction to urine outflow hydronephrosis dilation of the renal pelvis due to urine buildup leading to nephron damage and kidney atrophy complete obstructions like large calculi or tumors can halt urine production partial or intermittent obstructions can arise from ureteral calculi fibrous strictures tumors or an enlarged prostate spinal lesions damage to bladder nerves impairs micturition potentially causing overflow incontinence and hydronephrosis infections pyelonephritis infection of the upper urinary tract often ascending from lower tract infections cystitis bladder inflammation caused by bacteria eg e coli catheterization or radiotherapy leading to dysuria frequency haematuria and cloudy urine chronic cystitis often follows recurrent infections especially in older men with prostate issues urethritis inflammation of the urethra often due to neisseria gonorrhoeae tumors of the bladder papillomas typically benign with recurrence but may invade surrounding tissues solid tumors malignant often aggressive spreading via lymph and blood incontinence stress incontinence leakage with increased abdominal pressure common postchildbirth overflow incontinence due to obstruction or neurological impairment urge incontinence sudden urge linked to infection stones or tumors
protection and 4 survival the skin the skin completely covers the body and is continuous with the membranes lining the body orifices it protects the underlying structures from injury and from invasion by microbes contains sensory somatic nerve endings of pain temperature and touch is involved in the regulation of body temperature structure of the skin the skin has a surface area of about 15 to 2 m2 in adults and it contains glands hair and nails there are two main layers epidermis dermis between the skin and underlying structures there is a layer of subcutaneous fat epidermis fig 141 the epidermis is the most superficial layer of the skin and is composed of stratified keratinised squamous epithelium see fig 312 p 36 which varies in thickness in different parts of the body it is thickest on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet there are no blood vessels or nerve endings in the epidermis but its deeper layers are bathed in interstitial fluid from the dermis which provides oxygen and nutrients and is drained away as lymph there are several layers strata of cells in the epidermis which extend from the deepest germinative layer to the surface stratum corneum a thick horny layer the cells on the surface are flat thin nonnucleated dead cells or squames in which the cytoplasm has been replaced by the fibrous protein keratin these cells are constantly being rubbed off and replaced by cells which originated in the germinative layer and have undergone gradual change as they progressed towards the surface complete replacement of the epidermis takes about 40 days the maintenance of healthy epidermis depends upon three processes being synchronised desquamation shedding of the keratinised cells from the surface effective keratinisation of the cells approaching the surface continual cell division in the deeper layers with newly formed cells being pushed to the surface hairs secretions from sebaceous glands and ducts of sweat glands pass through the epidermis to reach the surface the surface of the epidermis is ridged by projections of cells in the dermis called the papillae the pattern of ridges is different in every individual and the impression made by them is the fingerprint the downward projections of the germinative layer between the papillae are believed to aid nutrition of epidermal cells and stabilise the two layers preventing damage due to shearing forces blisters develop when acute trauma causes separation of the dermis and epidermis and serous fluid collects between the two layers the colour of the skin is affected by three main factors melanin a dark pigment derived from the amino acid tyrosine and secreted by melanocytes in the deep germinative layer is absorbed by surrounding epithelial cells the amount is genetically determined and varies between different parts of the body between members of the same race and between races the number of melanocytes is fairly constant so the differences in colour depend on the amount of melanin secreted it protects the skin from the harmful effects of sunlight exposure to sunlight promotes synthesis of increased amounts of melanin m tjie level of oxygenation of haemoglobin and the amount of blood circulating in the dermis give the skin its pink colour bile pigments in blood and carotenes in subcutaneous fat give the skin a yellowish colour dermis fig 142 the dermis is tough and elastic it is formed from connective tissue and the matrix contains collagen fibres interlaced with elastic fibres rupture of elastic fibres occurs when the skin is overstretched resulting in permanent striae or stretch marks that may be found in pregnancy and obesity collagen fibres bind water and give the skin its tensile strength but as this ability declines with age wrinkles develop fibroblasts macrophages and mast cells are the main cells found in the dermis underlying its deepest layer there is areolar tissue and varying amounts of adipose tissue fat the structures in the dermis are blood vessels lymph vessels sensory somatic nerve endings sweat glands and their ducts hairs arrector pili muscles and sebaceous glands blood vessels arterioles form a fine network with capillary branches supplying sweat glands sebaceous glands hair follicles and the dermis the epidermis has no blood supply it obtains nutrients and oxygen from interstitial fluid derived from blood vessels in the papillae of the dermis lymph vessels these form a network throughout the dermis sensory nerve endings sensory receptors specialised nerve endings which are sensitive to touch change in temperature pressure and pain are widely distributed in the dermis incoming stimuli activate different types of sensory receptors shown in figure 142 and box 141 the skin is an important sensory organ through which individuals receive information about their environment nerve impulses generated in the sensory receptors in the dermis are conveyed to the spinal cord by sensory somatic cutaneous nerves then to the sensory area of the cerebrum where the sensations are perceived sweat glands sweat glands are found widely distributed throughout the skin and are most numerous in the palms of the hands soles of the feet axillae and groins they are composed of epithelial cells the bodies of the glands lie coiled in the subcutaneous tissue some ducts open onto the skin surface at tiny depressions or pores and others open into hair follicles glands opening into hair follicles do not become active until puberty in the axilla they secrete an odourless milky fluid which if decomposed by surface microbes causes an unpleasant odour the functions of this secretion are not known sweat glands are stimulated by sympathetic nerves in response to raised body temperature and fear the most important function of sweat secreted by glands opening on to the skin surface is in the regulation of body temperature evaporation of sweat from body surfaces takes heat from the body and the amount of sweat produced is governed by the temperatureregulating centre in the hypothalamus excessive sweating may lead to dehydration and serious depletion of body sodium chloride unless intake of water and salt is appropriately increased after 7 to 10 days exposure to high environmental temperatures the amount of salt lost is substantially reduced but water loss remains high hairs these are formed by a downgrowth of epidermal cells into the dermis or subcutaneous tissue called hair follicles at the base of the follicle is a cluster of cells called the bulb the hair is formed by multiplication of cells of the bulb and as they are pushed upwards away from their source of nutrition the cells die and become keratinised the part of the hair above the skin is the shaft and the remainder the root fig 142 the colour of the hair is genetically determined and depends on the amount of melanin present white hair is the result of the replacement of melanin by tiny air bubbles the arrector pili fig 142 these are little bundles of smooth muscle fibres attached to the hair follicles contraction makes the hair stand erect and raises the skin around the hair causing goose flesh the muscles are stimulated by sympathetic nerve fibres in response to fear and cold erect hairs trap air which acts as an insulating layer this is an efficient warming mechanism especially when accompanied by shivering ie involuntary contraction of the skeletal muscles the sebaceous glands fig 142 these consist of secretory epithelial cells derived from the same tissue as the hair follicles they secrete an oily substance sebum into the hair follicles and are therefore present in the skin of all parts of the body except the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet they are most numerous in the skin of the scalp face axillae and groins in regions of transition from one type of superficial epithelium to another such as lips eyelids nipple labia minora and glans penis there are sebaceous glands that are independent of hair follicles secreting sebum directly on to the surface sebum keeps the hair soft and pliable and gives it a shiny appearance on the skin it provides some waterproofing and acts as a bactericidal and fungicidal agent preventing the successful invasion of microbes it also prevents drying and cracking of skin especially on exposure to heat and sunshine the activity of these glands increases at puberty and is less at the extremes of age rendering infants and the elderly prone to the effects of excessive moisture eg nappy rash in infants nails fig 143 the nails in human beings are equivalent to the claws horns and hoofs of animals they are derived from the same cells as epidermis and hair and consist of a hard horny keratin plate they protect the tips of the fingers and toes the root of the nail is embedded in the skin is covered by the cuticle and forms the hemispherical pale area called the lunula the nail plate of the nail is the exposed part that has grown out from the germinative zone of the epidermis called the nail bed finger nails grow more quickly than toe nails and growth is quicker when the environmental temperature is high,the skin the bodys largest organ provides essential protection sensation and temperature regulation it consists of two main layers the epidermis and the dermis supported by a layer of subcutaneous fat the outer epidermis composed of keratinized cells forms a protective barrier it continuously renews itself with dead cells shedding off the surface while new cells from deeper layers migrate upward the pigment melanin produced by melanocytes in the epidermis absorbs harmful uv rays and contributes to skin color beneath the dermis provides strength and elasticity through collagen and elastic fibers it houses blood and lymph vessels sensory nerves hair follicles and glands sweat glands regulate body temperature through evaporative cooling while sebaceous glands produce sebum an oily substance that keeps skin moist and inhibits microbial growth hair and nails formed from keratin offer additional protection with hair follicles connected to arrector pili muscles that contract in response to cold or fear causing goosebumps and trapping insulating air skin color is influenced by melanin blood oxygen levels and carotenoids the skins structure enables it to defend against injury sense the environment and regulate internal temperature effectively
functions of the skin protection the skin forms a relatively waterproof layer that protects the deeper and more delicate structures as an important nonspecific defence mechanism it acts as a barrier against invasion by microbes chemicals physical agents eg mild trauma ultraviolet light dehydration the dermis contains specialised immune cells called langerhans cells they phagocytose intruding antigens and travel to lymphoid tissue where they present antigen to tlymphocytes thus stimulating an immune response p 379 due to the presence of the sensory nerve endings in the skin the body reacts by reflex action to unpleasant or painful stimuli protecting it from further injury p 159 regulation of body temperature the temperature of the body remains fairly constant at about 368c 984f across a wide range of environmental temperatures in health variations are usually limited to between 05 and 075c although it is raised slightly in the evening during exercise and in women just after ovulation when metabolic rate increases body temperature rises and when it decreases body temperature falls to ensure this constant temperature a balance is maintained between heat produced in the body and heat lost to the environment heat production some of the energy released in the cells during metabolic activity is in the form of heat and the most active organs chemically and physically produce the most heat the principal organs involved are as follows the muscles contraction of skeletal muscles produces a large amount of heat and the more strenuous the muscular exercise the greater the heat produced shivering involves muscle contraction and produces heat when there is the risk of the body temperature falling below normal the liver is very chemically active and heat is produced as a byproduct metabolic rate and heat production are increased after eating the digestive organs produce heat during peristalsis and by the chemical reactions involved in digestion heat loss most of the heat loss from the body occurs through the skin small amounts are lost in expired air urine and faeces only the heat lost through the skin can be regulated to maintain a constant body temperature there is no control over heat lost by the other routes heat loss through the skin is affected by the difference between body and environmental temperatures the amount of the body surface exposed to the air and the type of clothes worn air is a poor conductor of heat and when layers of air are trapped in clothing and between the skin and clothing they act as effective insulators against excessive heat loss for this reason several layers of lightweight clothes provide more effective insulation against a low environmental temperature than one heavy garment a balance is maintained between heat production and heat loss control is achieved mainly by thermoreceptors in the hypothalamus mechanisms of heat loss in evaporation the body is cooled when heat is used to convert the water in sweat to water vapour in radiation exposed parts of the body radiate heat away from the body in conduction clothes and other objects in contact with the skin take up heat in convection air passing over the exposed parts of the body is heated and rises cool air replaces it and convection currents are set up heat is also lost from the clothes by convection control of body temperature nervous control the temperature regulating centre in the hypothalamus is responsive to the temperature of circulating blood this centre controls body temperature through autonomic nerve stimulation of the sweat glands when body temperature rises the vasomotor centre in the medulla oblongata controls the diameter of the small arteries and arterioles and therefore the amount of blood which circulates in the capillaries in the dermis the vasomotor centre is influenced by the temperature of its blood supply and by nerve impulses from the hypothalamus when body temperature rises the skin capillaries dilate and the extra blood near the surface increases heat loss by radiation conduction and convection the skin is warm and pink in colour when body temperature falls arteriolar constriction conserves heat and the skin is whiter and feels cool activity of the sweat glands when the temperature of the body is increased by 025 to 05c the sweat glands are stimulated to secrete sweat which is conveyed to the surface of the body by ducts when sweat droplets can be seen on the skin the rate of production is exceeding the rate of evaporation this is most likely to happen when the environmental air is humid and the temperature high loss of heat from the body by unnoticeable evaporation of water through the skin and expired air occurs even when the environmental temperature is low this is called insensible water loss around 500 ml per day and is accompanied by insensible heat loss effects of vasodilatation the amount of heat lost from the skin depends to a great extent on the amount of blood in the vessels in the dermis as heat production increases the arterioles become dilated and more blood pours into the capillary network in the skin in addition to increasing the amount of sweat produced the temperature of the skin is raised and there is an increase in the amount of heat lost by radiation conduction and convection if the external environmental temperature is low or if heat production is decreased vasoconstriction is stimulated by sympathetic nerves this decreases the blood flow near the body surface conserving heat fever this is often the result of infection and is caused by release of chemicals pyrogens from damaged tissue and the cells involved in inflammation pyrogens act on the hypothalamus which releases prostaglandins that reset the hypothalamic thermostat to a higher temperature the body responds by activating heatpromoting mechanisms eg shivering and vasoconstriction until the new higher temperature is reached when the thermostat is reset to the normal level heatloss mechanisms are activated there is profuse sweating and vasodilatation accompanied by warm pink flushed skin until body temperature falls to the normal range again hypothermia this is present when core temperature eg the rectal temperature is below 35c 95f at a rectal temperature below 32c 896f compensatory mechanisms to restore body temperature usually fail eg shivering is replaced by muscle rigidity and cramps vasoconstriction fails to occur and there is lowered blood pressure pulse and respiration rates mental confusion and disorientation occur death usually occurs when the temperature falls below 25c 77f individuals at the extremes of age are prone to hypothermia formation of vitamin d 7dehydrocholesterol is a lipidbased substance in the skin and ultraviolet light from the sun converts it to vitamin d this circulates in the blood and is used with calcium and phosphate in the formation and maintenance of bone any vitamin d in excess of immediate requirements is stored in the liver sensation sensory receptors consist of nerve endings in the dermis that are sensitive to touch pressure temperature or pain stimulation generates nerve impulses in sensory nerves that are transmitted to the cerebral cortex see fig 720b p 153 some areas have more sensory receptors than others causing them to be especially sensitive eg the lips and fingertips absorption this property is limited but substances that can be absorbed include some drugs in transdermal patches eg hormones used as replacement therapy in postmenopausal women nicotine as an aid to stopping smoking some toxic chemicals eg mercury excretion the skin is a minor excretory organ for some substances including sodium chloride in sweat and excess sweating may lead to abnormally low blood sodium levels urea especially when kidney function is impaired aromatic substances eg garlic and other spices wound healing conditions required for wound healing systemic factors these include good nutritional status and general health infection impaired immunity poor blood supply and systemic conditions eg diabetes mellitus and cancer reduce the rate of wound healing local factors local factors that facilitate wound healing include good blood supply providing oxygen and nutrients and removing waste products freedom from contamination by eg microbes foreign bodies toxic chemicals primary healing healing by first intention this method of healing follows minimal destruction of tissue when the damaged edges of a wound are in close apposition fig 144 there are several overlapping stages in the repair process inflammation the cut surfaces become inflamed and blood clot and cell debris fill the gap between them in the first few hours phagocytes and fibroblasts migrate into the blood clot phagocytes begin to remove the clot and cell debris stimulating fibroblast activity fibroblasts secrete collagen fibres which begin to bind the surfaces together proliferation there is proliferation of epithelial cells across the wound through the clot the epidermis meets and grows upwards until the full thickness is restored the clot above the new tissue becomes the scab and separates after 3 to 10 days granulation tissue consisting of new capillary buds phagocytes and fibroblasts develops invading the clot and restoring the blood supply to the wound fibroblasts continue to secrete collagen fibres as the clot and any bacteria are removed by phagocytosis maturation the granulation tissue is replaced by fibrous scar tissue rearrangement of collagen fibres occurs and the strength of the wound increases in time the scar becomes less vascular appearing after a few months as a fine line the channels left when stitches are removed heal by the same process secondary healing healing by second intention this method of healing follows destruction of a large amount of tissue or when the edges of a wound cannot be brought into apposition eg varicose ulcers and pressure sores decubitus ulcers the stages of secondary healing are the same as in primary healing and the time taken for healing depends on the effective removal of the cause and on the size of the wound there are several recognised stages in the repair process eg of decubitus ulcers fig 145 inflammation this develops on the surface of the healthy tissue and separation of necrotic tissue slough begins due mainly to the action of phagocytes in the inflammatory exudate proliferation this begins as granulation tissue consisting of capillary buds phagocytes and fibroblasts develops at the base of the cavity it grows towards the surface probably stimulated by macrophages phagocytes in the plentiful blood supply tend to prevent infection of the wound by ingestion of bacteria after separation of the slough some fibroblasts in the wound develop a limited ability to contract reducing the size of the wound and healing time when granulation tissue reaches the level of the dermis epithelial cells at the edges proliferate and grow towards the centre maturation this occurs as scar tissue replaces granulation tissue usually over several months until the full thickness of the skin is restored the fibrous scar tissue is shiny and does not contain sweat glands hair follicles or sebaceous glands p 378,the skin is essential for protection temperature regulation sensation vitamin d synthesis absorption and excretion as a barrier it guards against pathogens chemicals uv light and dehydration langerhans cells in the dermis detect pathogens and initiate immune responses the skin also maintains body temperature through mechanisms like sweating vasodilation widening of blood vessels and vasoconstriction narrowing of blood vessels heat is produced primarily in muscles and the liver while heat loss occurs through radiation convection and sweat evaporation the skin synthesizes vitamin d when exposed to sunlight converting 7dehydrocholesterol into vitamin d which supports bone health sensory receptors within the dermis detect touch pressure temperature and pain transmitting signals to the brain for processing the skin also allows for the limited absorption of certain drugs and excretes small amounts of waste including urea and salts wound healing occurs in stages inflammation proliferation and maturation primary healing occurs with minimal tissue damage while secondary healing takes longer involving the filling of larger wounds with granulation tissue followed by scar formation

direct contact and affects mainly children and immunosuppressed individuals when caused by streptococcus pyogenes group a 3haemolytic streptococcus the infection may be complicated a few weeks later by an immune reaction causing glomerulonephritis p 351 cellulitis this is a spreading infection caused by some anaerobic microbes or by streptococcus pyogenes or clostridium perfringens the spread of infection is facilitated by the formation of enzymes that break down the connective tissue that normally isolates an area of inflammation the microbes enter the body through a break in the skin if untreated the products of inflammation may enter the blood causing septicaemia in severe cases necrotizing fasciitis may occur there is oedema and necrosis of subcutaneous tissue that usually includes

between the toes both infections are spread by direct contact noninfective inflammatory conditions eczema and dermatitis these two terms are synonymous and describe inflammatory conditions which can be acute or chronic in acute dermatitis there is redness swelling and exudation of serous fluid usually accompanied by itching this is often followed by crusting and scaling if the condition becomes chronic the skin thickens and may become leathery due to longterm scratching infection may complicate scratching atopic dermatitis is caused by allergens and commonly affects atopic individuals children who may also suffer from hay fever or asthma pp 259 and 260 are often affected contact dermatitis may be caused by direct contact with irritants eg cosmetics soap detergent strong acids or alkalis industrial chemicals a hypersensitivity reaction see fig 159 p 384 to eg synthetic rubber nickel dyes and other chemicals psoriasis this condition is genetically determined and characterised by exacerbations and periods of remission of varying duration it is a common condition especially between the ages of 15 and 40 years there is proliferation of the cells of the basal layers of the epidermis and the more rapid upward progress of these cells through the epidermis results in incomplete maturation of the upper layer the skin is shiny silver coloured and scaly bleeding may occur when scales are scratched or rubbed off the elbows knees and scalp are common sites but other parts can be affected triggering factors that lead to exacerbation of the condition include trauma infection and sunburn sometimes psoriasis is associated with arthritis acne vulgaris this is a common condition in adolescents that is thought to be caused by increased levels of male sex hormones

common sites are the face chest and upper back pressure sores also known as decubitus ulcers these occur over pressure points areas where the skin is compressed for long periods between a bony prominence and a hard surface eg a bed or chair when this occurs blood flow to the affected area is impaired and ischaemia develops initially the skin reddens and later as ischaemia and necrosis occur

the structure and functions of the skin infection is a common complication of any burn as the outer barrier formed by the epidermis is lost burns are classified according to their depth partial thickness superficial when only the epidermis is involved full thickness deep when the epidermis and dermis are destroyed these burns are usually relatively painless as the sensory nerve endings in the dermis are destroyed after a few days the destroyed tissue coagulates and forms an eschar or thick scab which sloughs off after 2 to 3 weeks in circumferential burns which encircle any area of the body complications may arise from constriction of the part by eschar hypothermia this develops when thermoregulation is impaired and excessive heat is lost infection infection of the surface of a burn may result in septicaemia renal failure this occurs when the kidney tubules cannot deal with the amount of waste from haemolysed erythrocytes and damaged tissue contractures these may develop later as fibrous scar tissue contracts distorting the limbs eg the hands and impairing function malignant tumours basal cell carcinoma this is the least malignant and most common type of skin cancer it is associated with longterm exposure to sunlight and is therefore most likely to occur on sunexposed sites usually the head or neck it appears as a shiny nodule and later this breaks down becoming an

rare condition a malignant tumour arises in the walls of lymphatic vessels a small redblue patch or nodule develops usually on the lower limbs it is also an aidsrelated disease and has thus become more common in such cases multiple lesions affect many sites of the body resistance and immunity an individual is under constant attack from an enormous range of potentially harmful invaders from the months spent in the womb to the end of his life these invaders include such diverse entities as bacteria viruses cancer cells parasites and foreign nonself cells eg in tissue transplant the body therefore has developed a wide selection of protective measures which can be divided into two categories nonspecific defence mechanisms these protect against any of an enormous range of possible dangers specific defence mechanisms these are grouped together under the term immunity resistance is directed against only one particular invader in addition immunological memory develops which confers longterm immunity to specific infections an antigen is anything that stimulates an immune response nonspecific defence mechanisms these are the first lines of general defence they prevent entry and minimise further passage of microbes and other foreign material into the body there are four main nonspecific defence mechanisms defence at body surfaces phagocytosis natural antimicrobial substances the inflammatory response defence at body surfaces when skin and mucous membrane are intact and healthy they provide an efficient physical barrier to invading microbes the outer layer of skin can be penetrated by only a few microbes and the mucus secreted by mucous membranes traps microbes and other foreign material on its sticky surface sebum and sweat secreted on to the skin surface contain antibacterial and antifungal substances hairs in the nose act as a coarse filter and the sweeping action of cilia in the respiratory tract moves mucus and inhaled foreign materials towards the throat then it is expectorated or swallowed the oneway flow of urine from the bladder minimises the risk of microbes ascending through the urethra into the bladder phagocytosis the process of phagocytosis cell eating is shown in figure 410 page 68 phagocytic defence cells such as macrophages and neutrophils are attracted to sites of inflammation and infection by chemotaxis when chemoattractants are released by injured cells and invading microbes phagocytes trap particles either by engulfing them with their body mass or by extending long pseudopodia towards them which grasp them and reel them in fig 151 these cells are nonselective in their targets they will bind engulf and digest foreign cells or particles macrophages have an important role as a link between the nonspecific and specific defence mechanisms after ingestion and digestion of an antigen they act as antigenpresenting cells displaying their antigen on their own cell surface to stimulate tlymphocytes and activate the immune response p 379 natural antimicrobial substances hydrochloric acid this is present in high concentrations in gastric juice and kills the majority of ingested microbes lysozyme this is a small molecule protein with antibacterial properties present in granulocytes tears and other body secretions it is not present in sweat urine and cerebrospinal fluid antibodies these are present in nasal secretions and saliva and are able to inactivate some microbes saliva this is secreted into the mouth and washes away food debris that may serve as culture medium for microbes its slightly acid reaction inhibits the growth of some microbes interferons these are substances produced by tlymphocytes and by cells that have been invaded by viruses they prevent viral replication within cells and spread of viruses to other cells complement complement is a system of about 20 proteins found in the blood and tissues it is activated by the presence of immune complexes an antigen and antibody bound together and by foreign sugars on bacterial cell walls complement binds to and makes holes in bacterial cell walls thus destroying the microbe binds to bacterial cell walls stimulating phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages attracts phagocytic cells such as neutrophils into an area of infection the inflammatory response this is the physiological response to tissue damage and is accompanied by a characteristic series of local changes fig 151 it most commonly takes place when microbes have overcome the nonspecific defence mechanisms its purpose is protective to isolate inactivate and remove both the causative agent and damaged tissue so that healing can take place inflammatory conditions are recognised by their latin suffix itis for example appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix and laryngitis is inflammation of the larynx causes of inflammation the numerous causes of inflammation may be classified as follows microbes eg bacteria viruses protozoa fungi physical agents eg heat cold mechanical injury ultraviolet and ionising radiation chemical agents organic eg microbial toxins and organic poisons such as weedkillers inorganic eg acids alkalis antigens that stimulate immunological responses acute inflammation episodes of acute inflammation are usually of short duration eg days to a few weeks and may range from mild to very severe the cardinal signs of inflammation are redness heat pain swelling loss of function the acute inflammatory response is described in a series of overlapping stages increased blood flow increased formation of tissue fluid and migration of leukocytes some of the most important substances released in inflammation are summarised in table 151 increased blood flow following injury both the arterioles supplying the damaged area and the local capillaries dilate increasing blood flow to the site this is caused mainly by the local release of a number of chemical mediators from damaged cells eg histamine and serotonin increased blood flow to the area of tissue damage provides more oxygen and nutrients for the increased cellular activity that accompanies inflammation increased blood flow causes the increased temperature and reddening of an inflamed area increased formation of tissue fluid one of the cardinal signs of inflammation is swelling oedema of the tissues involved which is caused by fluid leaving local blood vessels and entering the interstitial spaces there are two main causes of oedema increased permeability of small blood vessel walls this is caused by inflammatory mediators eg prostaglandins histamine and serotonin which are released by injured cells and cause the cells that form the singlelayered venule wall to pull apart from one another this opens channels that allow the movement of excess fluid which leaves the blood and enters the tissues and plasma proteins which are normally retained within the bloodstream and contribute to the osmotic pressure of the blood when plasma proteins leave the blood as in inflammation the osmotic pressure of the blood falls and water moves from the bloodstream into the tissues increased hydrostatic pressure the increased blood flow into the capillary bed forces fluid out of the vessels and into the tissues some interstitial fluid returns to the capillaries but most of the inflammatory exudate phagocytes and cell debris are removed in lymph vessels because the pores of lymph vessels are larger and the pressure inside is lower than in blood capillaries migration of leukocytes loss of fluid from the blood thickens it slowing flow and allowing the normally fastflowing white blood cells to make contact with and adhere to the vessel wall in the acute stages the most important leukocyte is the neutrophil which adheres to the blood vessel lining squeezes between the endothelial cells and enters the tissues where its main function is in phagocytosis of antigens later in the inflammatory response after about 24 hours macrophages become the predominant cell type at the inflamed site and they persist in the tissues if the situation is not resolved leading to chronic inflammation macrophages are larger and longer lived than the neutrophils they phagocytose deaddying tissue microbes and other antigenic material and deaddying neutrophils chemotaxis this is the chemical attraction of leukocytes to an area of inflammation the role of chemoattractants and the way in which they work is not fully understood it may be that chemoattractants act to retain passing leukocytes in the inflamed area rather than actively attracting them from distant areas of the body known chemoattractants include microbial toxins chemicals released from leukocytes prostaglandins from damaged cells and complement proteins,the skin faces various infections and inflammatory conditions viral infections include hpv which causes warts on hands face and feet and herpes viruses that lead to conditions like chickenpox shingles and cold sores bacterial infections such as impetigo and cellulitis occur mainly in children or immunocompromised people and spread through direct contact fungal infections like ringworm and athletes foot also spread via contact noninfective inflammatory skin conditions include eczema triggered by allergens or irritants and psoriasis a genetic condition where skin thickens and becomes scaly acne is common in adolescence and results from blocked sebaceous glands causing inflammation and scarring pressure sores develop in immobile individuals due to poor blood flow burns classified by depth compromise the skin barrier and can lead to infections and hypothermia skin tumors include basal cell carcinoma often caused by sunlight exposure malignant melanoma with high metastasis risk and kaposis sarcoma common in aids patients the bodys defense mechanisms include physical barriers phagocytosis by immune cells natural antimicrobial substances like lysozyme and interferons and the inflammatory response which involves increased blood flow and leukocyte activity to eliminate pathogens
benefits of acute inflammation most aspects of the inflammatory response are hugely beneficial promoting removal of the harmful agent and setting the scene for healing to follow promotion of phagocytosis see fig 48 neutrophils and macrophages in the tissues are actively recruited into inflamed areas they engulf particles of biological and nonbiological origin biological material includes dead and damaged cells microbes and damaged connective tissue fibres most biological material is digested by enzymes inside phagocytes phagocyte activity is promoted by the raised temperatures local and systemic associated with inflammation some microbes resist digestion and provide a possible source of future infection eg mycobacterium tuberculosis nonbiological materials which cannot be digested include inhaled dust particles and chemical substances many phagocytes may die in an inflamed area if the material they ingest resists digestion or if the number of particles is excessive when this happens the phagocytes disintegrate and release material that may become fibrosed or cause further damage promotion of the immune response formation of tissue exudate allows protective proteins such as antibodies to leave the bloodstream easily and collect at the site the antibodies may promote phagocytosis of the microbes and neutralise their toxins toxin dilution inflammatory exudate dilutes damaging and waste materials in the area and assists their removal from the site this is of particular importance when injurious chemicals and bacterial toxins are involved increased core temperature body temperature rises when an endogenous pyrogen interleukin 1 is released from macrophages and granulocytes in response to microbial toxins or immune complexes interleukin 1 is a chemical mediator that resets the temperature thermostat in the hypothalamus at a higher level causing pyrexia and other symptoms that may also accompany inflammation eg fatigue and loss of appetite pyrexia increases the metabolic rate of cells in the inflamed area and consequently there is an increased need for oxygen and nutrients the increased temperature of inflamed tissues has the twin benefits of inhibiting the growth and division of microbes whilst promoting the activity of phagocytes fibrin formation fibrinogen secreted by fibroblasts present in inflammatory exudate is acted upon by thromboplastin released from damaged cells and forms an insoluble fibrin network this may wall off the inflamed area preventing the spread of the cause bind together the cut edges of a wound during primary healing some microbes such as streptococcus pyogenes which causes tonsillitis pharyngitis and some skin infections secrete toxins that break down fibrin enabling infection to spread harmful effects of acute inflammation tissue swelling this is the result of the increased blood flow and exudation and is often accompanied by loss of function the effects can be harmful depending on the site in a joint limitation of movement in the larynx interference with breathing in a confined space such as inside the skull or under the periosteum of bone severe pain due to pressure on nerves pain this occurs when local swelling compresses sensory nerve endings it is exacerbated by chemical mediators of the inflammatory process eg bradykinin prostaglandins that potentiate the sensitivity of the sensory nerve endings to painful stimuli suppuration pus formation pus consists of dead phagocytes dead cells cell debris fibrin inflammatory exudate and living and dead microbes it is contained within a membrane of new blood capillaries phagocytes and fibroblasts the most common causative pyogenic microbes are staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes small amounts of pus form boils and larger amounts form abscesses staphylococcus aureus produces the enzyme coagulase which converts fibrinogen to fibrin localising the pus streptococcus pyogenes produces streptolysins that promote the breakdown of connective tissue causing spreading infection healing following pus formation is by granulation and fibrosis see ch 14 superficial abscesses tend to rupture through the skin and discharge pus healing is usually complete unless there is extensive tissue damage deepseated abscesses may have a variety of outcomes there may be early rupture with complete discharge of pus on to the surface followed by healing rupture and limited discharge of pus on to the surface followed by the development of a chronic abscess with an infected open channel or sinus fig 152 rupture and discharge of pus into an adjacent organ or cavity forming an infected channel open at both ends or fistula fig 153 eventual removal of pus by phagocytes followed by healing enclosure of pus by fibrous tissue that may become calcified harbouring live organisms which may become a source of future infection formation of fibrous adhesions between adjacent membranes eg pleura peritoneum shrinkage of fibrous tissue as it ages that may reduce the lumen or obstruct a tube eg oesophagus bowel blood vessel outcomes of acute inflammation resolution this occurs when the cause has been successfully overcome the inflammatory process is reversed and damaged cells are phagocytosed fibrin strands are broken down by fibrinolytic enzymes waste material is removed in lymph and blood vessels repair is complete leaving only a small scar development of chronic inflammation see below any form of acute inflammation may develop into the chronic form if resolution is not complete eg if live microbes remain at the site as in some deepseated abscesses wound infections and bone infections chronic inflammation the processes involved are very similar to those of acute inflammation but because the process is of longer duration considerably more tissue is likely to be destroyed the inflammatory cell types are mainly lymphocytes instead of neutrophils and fibroblasts are activated leading to the laying down of collagen and fibrosis if the body defences are unable to clear the infection they may try to wall it off instead forming nodules called granulomas within which are collections of defensive cells tuberculosis is an example of an infection which frequently becomes chronic leading to granuloma formation the causative bacterium mycobacterium tuberculosis is resistant to body defences and so pockets of organisms are sealed up in granulomas within the lungs chronic inflammation may either be a complication of acute inflammation see above or a primary condition of slow onset slow onset of inflammation this may have several causes there may be infection by lowvirulence organisms in an area with a poor blood supply eg endocarditis caused by nonhaemolytic streptococci inorganic materials may be involved for instance when an internal stitch has not dissolved toxic silicic acid is formed when silicon inhaled in dust is dissolved hypersensitivity may develop following repeated exposure to some chemicals eg in contact dermatitis skin proteins are altered when some chemicals are absorbed the altered proteins act as antigens stimulating the production of antibodies and initiating the inflammatory process fibrosis scar formation fibrous tissue is formed during healing when there is loss of tissue or the cells destroyed do not regenerate eg following chronic inflammation persistent ischaemia suppuration or largescale trauma the process begins with formation of granulation tissue then over time the new capillaries and inflammatory material are removed leaving only the collagen fibres secreted by the fibroblasts fibrous tissue may have longlasting damaging effects adhesions consisting of fibrous tissue may limit movement eg between the layers of pleura preventing inflation of the lungs between loops of bowel interfering with peristalsis fibrosis of infarcts blockage of an endvessel by a thrombus or an embolus causes an infarct area of dead tissue fibrosis of one large infarct or of numerous small infarcts may follow leading to varying degrees of organ dysfunction eg in heart brain kidneys liver tissue shrinkage occurs as fibrous tissue ages the effects depend on the site and extent of the fibrosis eg small tubes such as blood vessels air passages ureters the urethra and ducts of glands may become narrow or obstructed and lose their elasticity contractures bands of shrunken fibrous tissue may extend across joints eg in a limb or digit there may be limitation of movement or following burns of the neck the head may be pulled to one side,acute inflammation is a crucial protective response initiated by the body to harmful stimuli including pathogens and tissue injury this response facilitates the removal of harmful agents and prepares the area for healing key benefits include promotion of phagocytosis neutrophils and macrophages are actively recruited to inflamed tissues where they engulf and digest biological materials such as dead cells microbes and debris the increase in local temperature enhances the activity of these phagocytes improving their ability to clear infections activation of the immune response tissue exudate formed during inflammation allows protective proteins such as antibodies to exit the bloodstream and accumulate at the site of injury aiding in neutralizing toxins and enhancing phagocytosis toxin dilution inflammatory exudate helps dilute harmful substances facilitating their removal from the affected area increased core temperature pyrexia induced by endogenous pyrogens inhibits microbial growth while boosting the metabolic rate of cells thus promoting healing however acute inflammation can also lead to harmful effects including tissue swelling pain and pus formation if the inflammation is not resolved it may progress to chronic inflammation which involves persistent tissue damage and fibrosis potentially resulting in complications such as adhesions and impaired organ function
immunity the cell type involved in immunity is the lymphocyte p 67 this white blood cell is manufactured in the bone marrow and has a characteristically large single nucleus once released into the bloodstream from the bone marrow lymphocytes are further processed to make two functionally distinct types the tlymphocyte and the blymphocyte tlymphocytes these are processed by the thymus gland which lies between the heart and the sternum the hormone thymosin produced by the thymus is responsible for promoting the processing which leads to the formation of fully specialised differentiated mature functional tlymphocytes it is important to recognise that a mature tlymphocyte has been programmed to recognise only one type of antigen and during its subsequent travels through the body will react to no other antigen however dangerous it might be thus a tlymphocyte manufactured to recognise the chickenpox virus will not react to a measles virus a cancer cell or a tuberculosis bacterium tlymphocytes provide cellmediated immunity discussed below blymphocytes these are processed in the bone marrow their role is in production of antibodies immunoglobulins which are proteins designed to bind to and cause the destruction of an antigen as with tlymphocytes each blymphocyte targets one specific antigen the antibody released reacts with one type of antigen and no other blymphocytes provide antibodymediated immunity discussed below from this description of t and blymphocytes it is clear that for every one of the millions of possible antigens that might be encountered in life there is one corresponding t and blymphocyte there is therefore a vast number of different t and blymphocytes in the body each capable of responding to only one antigen cellmediated immunity tlymphocytes that have been activated in the thymus gland are released into the circulation when they encounter their antigen for the first time they become sensitised to it if the antigen has come from outside the body it needs to be presented to the tlymphocyte on the surface of an antigenpresenting cell there are different types of antigenpresenting cell including macrophages macrophages are part of the nonspecific defences because they engulf and digest antigens indiscriminately but they also participate in immune responses to do this after digesting the antigen they transport the most antigenic fragment to their own cell membrane and display it on their surface fig 154 on their movement around the body still displaying the antigen fragment they eventually come into contact with the tlymphocyte that has been processed to target that particular antigen if the antigen is an abnormal body cell such as a cancer cell it too will be displaying foreign nonself material on its cell membrane that will stimulate the tlymphocyte whichever way the antigen is presented to the tlymphocyte it stimulates the division and proliferation clonal expansion of the tlymphocyte fig 154 three main types of specialised tlymphocyte are produced each of which is still directed against the original antigen but which will tackle it in different ways memory tcells these provide cellmediated immunity by responding rapidly to another encounter with the same antigen cytotoxic tcells these directly inactivate any cells carrying antigens they attach themselves to the target cell and release powerful toxins which are very effective because the two cells are so close together the main role of cytotoxic tlymphocytes is in destruction of abnormal body cells eg infected cells and cancer cells helper tcells these are essential for correct functioning of not only cellmediated immunity but also antibodymediated immunity their central role in immunity is emphasised in situations where they are destroyed as by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv when helper tlymphocyte numbers fall significantly the whole immune system is compromised thelpers are the commonest of the tlymphocytes their main functions include production of special chemicals called cytokines eg interleukins and interferons which support and promote cytotoxic tlymphocytes and macrophages cooperating with blymphocytes to produce antibodies although blymphocytes are responsible for antibody manufacture they require to be stimulated by a helper tlymphocyte first antibodymediated humoral immunity blymphocytes unlike tlymphocytes which are free to circulate around the body are fixed in lymphoid tissue eg the spleen and lymph nodes blymphocytes unlike tlymphocytes recognise and bind antigen particles without having to be presented with them by an antigenpresenting cell once its antigen has been detected and bound and with the help of a helper tlymphocyte the blymphocyte enlarges and begins to divide clonal expansion fig 155 it produces two functionally distinct types of cell plasma cells and memory bcells plasma cells these secrete antibodies into the blood antibodies are carried throughout the tissues while the blymphocytes themselves remain fixed in lymphoid tissue plasma cells live no longer than a day and produce only one type of antibody which targets the specific antigen that originally bound to the blymphocyte antibodies bind to antigens labelling them as targets for other defence cells such as cytotoxic tlymphocytes and macrophages bind to bacterial toxins neutralising them activate complement p 375 memory bcells these cells remain in the body long after the initial episode has been dealt with and rapidly respond to another encounter with the same antigen by stimulating the production of antibodysecreting plasma cells the interdependence of the two parts of the immune system is summarised in figure 156 the fact that the body does not normally develop immunity to its own cells is due to the fine balance that exists between the immune reaction and its suppression autoimmune diseases are due to the disturbance of this balance acquired immunity when antigens eg microbes are encountered for the first time there is a primary response in which a low level of antibodies can be detected in the blood after about 2 weeks although the response may be sufficient to combat the antigen the antibody levels then fall unless there is another encounter with the same antigen within a short period of time 2 to 4 weeks the second encounter produces a secondary response in which there is a rapid response by memory bcells resulting in a marked increase in antibody production fig 157 further increases can be achieved by later encounters but eventually a maximum is reached this principle is used in active immunisation against infectious diseases immunity may be acquired naturally or artificially and both forms may be active or passive fig 158 active immunity means that the individual has responded to an antigen and produced his own antibodies lymphocytes are activated and the memory cells formed provide longlasting resistance in passive immunity the individual is given antibodies produced by someone else the antibodies are then destroyed and unless lymphocytes are stimulated passive immunity is short lasting active naturally acquired immunity the body may be stimulated to produce its own antibodies by having the disease during the course of the illness blymphocytes develop into plasma cells that produce antibodies in sufficient quantities to overcome the infection after recovery the memory bcells retain the ability to produce more plasma cells that produce the specific antibodies conferring immunity to future infection by the same microbe or strain of microbe having a subclinical subliminal infection in this case the microbial infection is not sufficiently severe to cause clinical disease but stimulates sufficient memory bcells to establish immunity active artificially acquired immunity this type of immunity develops in response to the administration of dead or live artificially weakened microbes vaccines or deactivated toxins toxoids the vaccines and toxoids retain the antigenic properties that stimulate the development of immunity but they cannot cause the disease many microbial diseases can be prevented by artificial immunisation examples are shown in box 151 active immunisation against some infectious disorders confers lifelong immunity eg diphtheria whooping cough or mumps in other infections the immunity may last for a number of years or for only a few weeks before revaccination is necessary apparent loss of immunity may be due to infection with a different strain of the same microbe which has different antigenic properties but causes the same clinical illness eg viruses that cause the common cold and influenza in the elderly and when nutrition is poor the production of lymphocytes especially blymphocytes is reduced and the primary and secondary response may be inadequate passive naturally acquired immunity this type of immunity is acquired before birth by the passage of maternal antibodies across the placenta to the fetus and to the baby in breast milk the variety of different antibodies provided depends on the mothers active immunity the babys lymphocytes are not stimulated and the immunity is short lived passive artificially acquired immunity in this type readymade antibodies in human or animal serum are injected into the recipient the source of the antibodies may be an individual who has recovered from the infection or animals commonly horses that have been artificially actively immunised specific immunoglobulins antiserum may be administered prophylactically to prevent the development of disease in people who have been exposed to the infection or therapeutically after the disease has developed proteins in serum sometimes cause sensitisation of lymphocytes that may be damaging if encountered a second time causing an abnormal immune reaction,acute inflammation is a crucial protective response initiated by the body to harmful stimuli including pathogens and tissue injury this response facilitates the removal of harmful agents and prepares the area for healing key benefits include promotion of phagocytosis neutrophils and macrophages are actively recruited to inflamed tissues where they engulf and digest biological materials such as dead cells microbes and debris the increase in local temperature enhances the activity of these phagocytes improving their ability to clear infections activation of the immune response tissue exudate formed during inflammation allows protective proteins such as antibodies to exit the bloodstream and accumulate at the site of injury aiding in neutralizing toxins and enhancing phagocytosis toxin dilution inflammatory exudate helps dilute harmful substances facilitating their removal from the affected area increased core temperature pyrexia induced by endogenous pyrogens inhibits microbial growth while boosting the metabolic rate of cells thus promoting healing however acute inflammation can also lead to harmful effects including tissue swelling pain and pus formation if the inflammation is not resolved it may progress to chronic inflammation which involves persistent tissue damage and fibrosis potentially resulting in complications such as adhesions and impaired organ function
hypersensitivity allergy allergy is powerful immune response to an antigen allergen the allergen itself is usually harmless eg house dust animal dander grass pollen it is therefore usually the immune response that causes the damage to the body not the allergen itself upon initial exposure to the allergen the individual becomes sensitised to it and on second and subsequent exposures the immune system mounts a response entirely out of proportion to the perceived threat it should be noted that these responses are exaggerated versions of normal immune function sometimes symptoms are mild if annoying eg the running nose and streaming eyes of hay fever occasionally the reaction can be extreme overwhelming body systems and causing death eg anaphylactic shock p 111 there are four mechanisms of hypersensitivity which are classified according to what parts of the immune system are involved they are summarised in figure 159 type i anaphylactic hypersensitivity this occurs in individuals who have inherited very high levels of a type of antibody called immunoglobulin e ige when exposed to an allergen eg house dust these high levels of antibody activate mast cells and basophils p 66 which release their granular contents the most important substance released is histamine which constricts some smooth muscle eg airway smooth muscle causes vasodilatation and increases vascular permeability leading to exudation of fluid and proteins into the tissues examples of type i reactions include the serious situation of anaphylaxis there is profound bronchoconstriction and shock due to extensive vasodilatation the condition can lead to death type ii cytotoxic hypersensitivity when an antibody reacts with an antigen on a cell surface that cell is marked for destruction by a number of mechanisms eg phagocytosis or destruction by lytic enzymes this is the usual procedure in the elimination of for example bacteria but if the antibodies are directed against selfantigens the result is destruction of the bodys own tissues autoimmune disease type ii mechanisms cause other conditions eg haemolytic disease of the newborn p 71 and transfusion reactions p 72 type iii immunecomplexmediated hypersensitivity antibodyantigen complexes immune complexes are usually cleared efficiently from the blood by phagocytosis if they are not for example when there is phagocyte failure or an excessive production of immune complexes eg in chronic infections they can be deposited in tissues eg kidneys skin joints and the eye where they set up an inflammatory reaction the kidney is a common site of deposition since it receives a large proportion of the cardiac output and filters the blood immune complexes collecting here lodge in and block the glomeruli p 351 impairing kidney function glomerulonephritis sensitivity to penicillin is also a type iii reaction antibodies bind to penicillin the antigen and the symptoms are the result of deposition of immune complexes in tissues rashes joint pains and sometimes haematuria type iv delayed type hypersensitivity unlike types iiii type iv hypersensitivity does not involve antibodies but is an overreaction of tlymphocytes to an antigen when an antigen is detected by memory tlymphocytes it provokes clonal expansion of the tlymphocyte fig 154 and large numbers of cytotoxic tlymphocytes are released to eliminate the antigen usually this system is controlled and the tlymphocyte response is appropriate if not the actively aggressive cytotoxic tlymphocytes damage normal tissues an example of this is contact dermatitis p 369 graft rejection is also caused by tlymphocytes an incompatible skin graft for instance will become necrotic and slough off in the days following application of the graft autoimmune diseases normally an immune response is mounted only against foreign nonself antigens but occasionally the body fails to recognise its own tissues and attacks itself the resulting autoimmune disorders examples of type ii hypersensitivity include a number of relatively common conditions rheumatoid arthritis p 425 the body produces antibodies to the membrane lining the joints the synovial membrane in most sufferers the antibody can be detected in the blood it is called rheumatoid factor the antibodies bind to the synovial membrane leading to chronically inflamed joints that are stiff painful and swollen hashimotos disease p 230 the body makes antibodies to thyroglobulin leading to destruction of thyroid hormone and hyposecretion of the thyroid graves disease the body makes antibodies to the thyroid cells unlike hashimotos disease however the effect of the antibodies is to stimulate the gland with a resultant hyperthyroidism p229 autoimmune haemolytic anaemia p 72 in this individuals make antibodies to their own red blood cells leading to haemolytic anaemia myasthenia gravis this autoimmune condition of unknown origin affects more women than men and usually those between 20 and 40 years antibodies are produced that bind to and block the acetylcholine receptors of neuromuscular junctions the transmission of nerve impulses to muscle fibres is therefore blocked this causes progressive and extensive muscle weakness although the muscles are normal extraocular and eyelid muscles are affected first causing ptosis drooping of the eyelid or diplopia double vision followed by those of the neck possibly affecting chewing swallowing and speech and limbs there are periods of remission relapses being precipitated by for example strenuous exercise infections or pregnancy immunodeficiency when the immune system is compromised there is a tendency to recurrent infections often by microbes not normally pathogenic in humans opportunistic infections immunodeficiency is classified as primary usually occurring in infancy and genetically mediated or secondary that is acquired in later life as the result of another disease eg protein deficiency acute infection chronic renal failure bone marrow diseases following splenectomy or acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids this condition is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv an rna retrovirus which produces the enzyme reverse transcriptase inside the cells of the infected person host cells this enzyme transforms viral rna to dna and this new dna called the provirus is incorporated into the host cell dna the host cell then produces new copies of the virus that pass out into tissue fluid and blood and infect other host cells when infected host cells divide copies of the provirus are integrated into the dna of daughter cells spreading the disease within the body hiv has an affinity for cells that have a protein receptor called cd4 in their membrane including tlymphocytes monocytes macrophages some blymphocytes and possibly cells in the gastrointestinal tract and neuroglial cells in the brain helper tcells fig 154 are the main cells involved when infected their number is reduced causing suppression of both antibodymediated and cellmediated immunity with the consequent development of widespread opportunistic infections often by microbes of relatively low pathogenicity hiv has been isolated from semen cervical secretions lymphocytes plasma cerebrospinal fluid tears saliva urine and breast milk the secretions known to be especially infectious are semen cervical secretions blood and blood products infection is spread by sexual intercourse vaginal and anal contaminated needles used during treatment of patients when drug abusers share needles an infected mother to her child across the placenta before birth while the baby is passing through the birth canal possibly by breast milk the presence of antibodies to hiv indicates that the individual has been exposed to the virus but not that a naturally acquired immunity has developed not all those who have antibodies in their blood develop aids although they may act as carriers and spread the infection to others a few weeks after infection there may be an acute influenzalike illness with no special features followed by a period of two or more years without symptoms chronic hiv infection may cause persistent generalised lymphadenopathy pgl some patients may then develop aidsrelated complex arc and experience chronic lowgrade fever diarrhoea weight loss anaemia and leukopenia when aids develops the main complications are widespread recurrent opportunistic infections and tumours outstanding features include the following pneumonia may be present commonly caused by pneumocystis carinii but many other microbes may be involved there may be persistent nausea diarrhoea and loss of weight due to recurrent infections of the alimentary tract by a wide variety of microbes meningitis encephalitis and brain abscesses may be recurrent either caused by opportunistic microbes or possibly by hiv there may be deterioration in neurological function characterised by forgetfulness loss of concentration confusion apathy dementia limb weakness ataxia and incontinence skin eruptions often widespread may be seen eg eczema psoriasis cellulitis impetigo warts shingles and cold sores generalised lymphadenopathy may occur ie noninfective enlargement of lymph nodes there may be malignant tumours lymphomas ie tumours of lymph nodes kaposis sarcoma consisting of tumours under the skin and in internal organs p 371,hypersensitivity allergy refers to exaggerated immune responses to usually harmless antigens such as pollen or dust upon first exposure the immune system becomes sensitized leading to disproportionate reactions upon subsequent exposures the four types of hypersensitivity are type i anaphylactic hypersensitivity triggered by ige antibodies resulting in histamine release which can cause severe reactions like anaphylaxis type ii cytotoxic hypersensitivity antibodies mistakenly attack selfantigens damaging body tissues seen in autoimmune diseases and transfusion reactions type iii immune complexmediated hypersensitivity involves deposition of antibodyantigen complexes in tissues causing inflammation exemplified by glomerulonephritis type iv delayed type hypersensitivity mediated by tlymphocytes leading to conditions like contact dermatitis autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system attacks its own tissues examples include rheumatoid arthritis hashimotos disease and myasthenia gravis immunodeficiency can be primary genetic or secondary acquired acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids caused by hiv leads to a weakened immune system by targeting cd4 tlymphocytes this results in increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections and complications like pneumonia and neurological disorders
the skeleton bone bone is a strong and durable type of connective tissue it consists of water 25 organic constituents including osteoid the carboncontaining part of the matrix and bone cells 25 inorganic constituents mainly calcium phosphate 50 although bones are often thought to be static or permanent they are highly vascular living structures that are continuously being remodelled types of bones bones are classified as long short irregular flat and sesamoid long bones these consist of a shaft and two extremities as the name suggests the length is much greater than the width examples include the femur tibia and fibula short irregular flat and sesamoid bones these have no shafts or extremities and are diverse in shape and size examples include short bones carpals wrist irregular bonesvertebrae and some skull bones flat bones sternum ribs and most skull bones sesamoid bones patella knee cap bone structure general structure of a long bone fig 161 these have a diaphysis or shaft and two epiphyses or extremities the diaphysis is composed of compact bone with a central medullary canal containing fatty yellow bone marrow the epiphyses consist of an outer covering of compact bone with cancellous bone inside the diaphysis and epiphyses are separated by epiphyseal cartilages which ossify when growth is complete thickening of a bone occurs by the deposition of new bone tissue under the periosteum long bones are almost completely covered by a vascular membrane the periosteum the outer layer is fibrous and the inner layer is osteogenic containing osteoblasts boneforming cells and osteoclasts bonedestroying cells which are involved in maintenance and remodelling of bones it gives attachment to muscles and tendons and protects bones from injury hyaline cartilage replaces periosteum on the articular surfaces of bones forming sy no vial joints structure of short irregular flat and sesamoid bones these have a relatively thin outer layer of compact bone with cancellous bone inside containing red bone marrow fig 162 they are enclosed by periosteum except the inner layer of the cranial bones where it is replaced by dura mater microscopic structure of bone compact cortical bone to the naked eye compact bone appears solid but on microscopic examination large numbers of haversian systems or osteons are seen fig 163 these consist of a central haversian canal containing blood and lymph vessels and nerves surrounded by concentric rings or plates of bone lamellae between these are lacunae tiny spaces containing tissue fluid and spidershaped osteocytes mature bone cells canaliculi link the lacunae with each other and with the central haversian canal the tissue fluid nourishes the bone cells the areas between haversian systems contain interstitial lamellae remains of older systems partially broken down during remodelling or growth of bone the tubular arrangement of lamellae gives bone greater strength than a solid structure of the same size cancellous trabecular spongy bone to the naked eye cancellous bone looks like a honeycomb microscopic examination reveals a framework formed from trabeculae meaning little beams which consist of a few lamellae and osteocytes interconnected by canaliculi fig 164 the spaces between the trabeculae contain red bone marrow that nourishes the osteocytes bone cells the cells responsible for bone formation are osteoblasts these later mature into osteocytes osteoblasts and chondrocytes cartilageforming cells develop from the same parent fibrous healing of fractures ie if the oxygen supply is deficient there may be a preponderance of chondroblasts resulting in a cartilaginous union of the fracture osteoblasts these are the boneforming cells that secrete collagen and other constituents of bone tissue they are present in the deeper layers of periosteum in the centres of ossification of immature bone at the ends of the diaphysis adjacent to the epiphyseal cartilages of long bones at the site of a fracture osteocytes as bone develops osteoblasts become trapped and remain isolated in lacunae they stop forming new bone at this stage and are called osteocytes osteocytes are nourished by tissue fluid in the canaliculi that radiate from the haversian canals their functions are not clear but they may be associated with the movement of calcium between the bones and the bloodtissue cells differentiation into osteogenic cells rather than chondroblasts is believed to depend upon an adequate oxygen supply this may be a factor affecting osteoclasts their function is resorption of bone to maintain the optimum shape this takes place at bone surfaces under the periosteum to maintain the shape of bones during growth and to remove excess callus formed during healing of fractures round the walls of the medullary canal during growth and to canalise callus during healing a fine balance of osteoblast and osteoclast activity maintains normal bone structure and functions development of bone tissue osteogenesis or ossification this begins before birth and is not complete until about the 21st year of life fig 165 long short and irregular bones develop from rods of cartilage cartilage models flat bones develop from membrane models and sesamoid bones from tendon models bone development consists of two processes secretion by osteoblasts of osteoid ie collagen fibres in a mucopolysaccharide matrix which gradually replaces the original cartilage and membrane models calcification of osteoid immediately after its deposition there are two types of arrangement of collagen in osteoid woven nonlamellar bone collagen fibres are deposited in irregular bundles then ossified this primitive bone structure is part of normal fetal development occurring during ossification of bones that originate as membrane models eg skull bones in adults it is also present in bone tumours and healing fractures p 407 lamellar bone the collagen fibres are deposited as in woven bone organised into characteristic lamellae found in compact and cancellous bone then ossified this occurs when cartilage models are replaced by bone and in healing of fractures development of long bones in long bones the focal points from which ossification begins are small areas of osteogenic cells or centres of ossification in the cartilage model this is accompanied by development of a bone collar at about 8 weeks of gestation later the blood supply develops and bone tissue replaces cartilage as osteoblasts secrete osteoid components in the shaft the bone lengthens as ossification continues and spreads to the epiphyses around birth secondary centres of ossification develop in the epiphyses and the medullary canal forms when osteoclasts break down the central bone tissue in the middle of the shaft after birth the bone grows in length by ossification of the diaphyseal surface of the epiphyseal cartilages and growth is complete when the cartilages become completely ossified fig 165 hormonal regulation of bone growth hormones that regulate the growth and consistency of size and shape of bones include the following growth hormone and the thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine are especially important during infancy and childhood deficient or excessive secretion of these results in abnormal development of the skeleton testosterone and oestrogens influence the physical changes that occur at puberty ie the growth spurt and masculinising or feminising changes of specific parts of the skeleton eg the pelvis cdcitonin from the thyroid gland and parathyroid hormone from the parathyroid glands are involved in homeostasis of blood and bone calcium levels required for bone development although the length and shape of bones does not normally change after ossification is complete bone tissue is continually being remodelled and replaced when damaged osteoblasts continue to lay down osteoid and osteoclasts reabsorb it the rate in different bones varies eg the distal part of the femur is replaced gradually over a period of 5 to 6 months functions of bones bones have a variety of functions they provide the framework of the body give attachment to muscles and tendons permit movement of the body as a whole and of parts of the body by forming joints that are moved by muscles form the boundaries of the cranial thoracic and pelvic cavities protecting the organs they contain contain red bone marrow in which blood cells develop haematopoiesis see fig 42 p 62 provide a reservoir of minerals especially calcium phosphate bone markings most bones have rough surfaces raised protuberances and ridges which give attachment to muscle tendons and ligaments these are not included in the following descriptions of individual bones unless they are of particular note but many are marked on illustrations related terminology is defined on page 45 the bones of the skeleton are divided into two groups the axial skeleton and the appendicular skeleton fig 166,bones are strong dynamic structures made up of water organic materials like osteoid and bone cells and inorganic components mainly calcium phosphate they are essential for body structure movement organ protection and mineral storage bone types include long eg femur short eg carpals irregular eg vertebrae flat eg ribs and sesamoid bones eg patella long bones consist of a diaphysis shaft with a central marrow cavity and epiphyses ends with cancellous bone covered by the periosteum a vascular membrane that aids in healing and attachment long bones grow by adding layers under this membrane key bone cells are osteoblasts boneforming osteocytes mature cells in lacunae and osteoclasts boneresorbing balancing bone growth and repair bone formation or ossification involves osteoblasts secreting osteoid which calcifies gradually replacing cartilage models especially in fetal development hormones like growth hormone thyroid hormones and sex hormones guide bone growth influencing growth spurts and skeletal changes in puberty bone remodeling vital for maintaining strength is continuous as osteoblasts lay down new tissue and osteoclasts resorb old bone the skeleton is divided into the axial central and appendicular limbs parts each contributing to movement protection and structural integrity
axial skeleton this part consists of the skull vertebral column ribs and sternum together the bones forming these structures constitute the central bony core of the body the axis skull figs 167 and 168 the skull rests on the upper end of the vertebral column and its bony structure is divided into two parts the cranium and the face cranium the cranium is formed by a number of flat and irregular bones that provide a bony protection for the brain it has a base upon which the brain rests and a vault that surrounds and covers it the periosteum inside the skull bones consists of the outer layer of dura mater in the mature skull the joints sutures between the bones are immovable fibrous the bones have numerous perforations eg foramina fissures through which nerves blood and lymph vessels pass the bones of the cranium are 1 frontal bone 2 parietal bones 2 temporal bones 1 occipital bone 1 sphenoid bone 1 ethmoid bone frontal bone this is the bone of the forehead it forms part of the orbital cavities eye sockets and the prominent ridges above the eyes the supraorbital margins just above the supraorbital margins within the bone there are two airfilled cavities or sinuses lined with ciliated mucous membrane which have openings into the nasal cavity the coronal suture joins the frontal and parietal bones and other fibrous joints are formed with the sphenoid zygomatic lacrimal nasal and ethmoid bones the bone originates in two parts joined in the midline by the frontal suture fig 1615 parietal bones these bones form the sides and roof of the skull they articulate with each other at the sagittal suture with the frontal bone at the coronal suture with the occipital bone at the lambdoidal suture and with the temporal bones at the squamous sutures the inner surface is concave and is grooved by the brain and blood vessels temporal bones fig 169 these bones lie one on each side of the head and form immovable joints with the parietal occipital sphenoid and zygomatic bones each temporal bone has several important features the squamous part is the thin fanshaped part that articulates with the parietal bone the zygomatic process articulates with the zygomatic bone to form the zygomatic arch cheekbone the mastoid part contains the mastoid process a thickened region behind the ear it contains a large number of very small air sinuses which communicate with the middle ear and are lined with squamous epithelium the petrous portion forms part of the base of the skull and contains the organs of hearing the spiral organ and balance the temporal bone articulates with the mandible at the temporomandibular joint the only movable joint of the skull immediately behind this articulating surface is the external auditory meatus auditory canal which passes inwards towards the petrous portion of the bone occipital bone fig 1610 this bone forms the back of the head and part of the base of the skull it has immovable joints with the parietal temporal and sphenoid bones its inner surface is deeply concave and the concavity is occupied by the occipital lobes of the cerebrum and by the cerebellum the occiput has two articular condyles that form hinge joints with the first bone of the vertebral column the atlas between the condyles there is the foramen magnum meaning targe hole through which the spinal cord passes into the cranial cavity sphenoid bone fig 1611 this bone occupies the middle portion of the base of the skull and it articulates with the occipital temporal parietal and frontal bones fig 168 on the superior surface in the middle of the bone there is a little saddleshaped depression the hypophyseal fossa sella turcica in which the pituitary gland rests the body of the bone contains some fairly large air sinuses lined by ciliated mucous membrane with openings into the nasal cavity ethmoid bone fig 1612 the ethmoid bone occupies the anterior part of the base of the skull and helps to form the orbital cavity the nasal septum and the lateral walls of the nasal cavity on each side are two projections into the nasal cavity the upper and middle conchae or turbinated processes it is a very delicate bone containing many air sinuses lined with ciliated epithelium and with openings into the nasal cavity the horizontal flattened part the cribriform plate forms the roof of the nasal cavity and has numerous small foramina through which nerve fibres of the olfactory nerve sense of smell pass upwards from the nasal cavity to the brain there is also a very fine perpendicular plate of bone that forms the upper part of the nasal septum face the skeleton of the face is formed by 13 bones in addition to the frontal bone already described figure 1613 shows the relationships between the bones 2 zygomatic or cheek bones 1 maxilla originated as 2 2 nasal bones 2 lacrimal bones 1 vomer 2 palatine bones 2 inferior conchae 1 mandible originated as 2 zygomatic or cheek bones the zygomatic bones form the prominences of the cheeks and part of the floor and lateral walls of the orbital cavities maxilla or upper jaw bone this originates as two bones but fusion takes place before birth the maxilla forms the upper jaw the anterior part of the roof of the mouth the lateral walls of the nasal cavity and part of the floor of the orbital cavities the alveolar ridge or process projects downwards and carries the upper teeth on each side there is a large air sinus the maxillary sinus lined with ciliated mucous membrane and with openings into the nasal cavity nasal bones these are two small flat bones which form the greater part of the lateral and superior surfaces of the bridge of the nose lacrimal bones these two small bones are posterior and lateral to the nasal bones and form part of the medial walls of the orbital cavities each is pierced by a foramen for the passage of the nasolacrimal duct which carries the tears from the medial canthus of the eye to the nasal cavity vomer the vomer is a thin flat bone which extends upwards from the middle of the hard palate to form the main part of the nasal septum superiorly it articulates with the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone palatine bones these are two lshaped bones the horizontal parts unite to form the posterior part of the hard palate and the perpendicular parts project upwards to form part of the lateral walls of the nasal cavity at their upper extremities they form part of the orbital cavities inferior conchae each concha is a scrollshaped bone which forms part of the lateral wall of the nasal cavity and projects into it below the middle concha the superior and middle conchae are parts of the ethmoid bone mandible fig 1614 this is the only movable bone of the skull it originates as two parts which unite at the midline each half consists of two main parts a curved body with the alveolar ridge containing the lower teeth and a ramus which projects upwards almost at right angles to the posterior end of the body at the upper end the ramus divides into the condilar process which articulates with the temporal bone to form the temporomandibular joint and the coronoid process that gives attachment to muscles and ligaments the point where the ramus joins the body is the angle of the jaw hyoid bone this is an isolated horseshoeshaped bone lying in the soft tissues of the neck just above the larynx and below the mandible see fig 104 p 242 it does not articulate with any other bone but is attached to the styloid process of the temporal bone by ligaments it gives attachment to the base of the tongue sinuses sinuses containing air are present in the sphenoid ethmoid maxillary and frontal bones they all communicate with the nasal cavity and are lined with ciliated mucous membrane their functions are to give resonance to the voice to lighten the bones of the face and cranium making it easier for the head to balance on top of the vertebral column fontanelles of the skull fig 1615 at birth ossification of the cranial sutures is incomplete where three or more bones meet there are distinct membranous areas or fontanelles the two largest are the anterior fontanelle not fully ossified until the child is 12 to 18 months old and the posterior fontanelle usually ossified 2 to 3 months after birth the skull bones do not fuse before birth to allow for moulding of the babys head during its passage through the birth canal,the axial skeleton forms the bodys central framework including the skull vertebral column ribs and sternum the skull is composed of the cranium and facial bones the cranium encloses and protects the brain consisting of flat bones like the frontal parietal temporal occipital sphenoid and ethmoid these bones connect via immovable joints called sutures with small openings foramina that allow nerves and blood vessels to pass the facial bones shape the face and include the zygomatic cheekbones maxilla upper jaw nasal and the mandible lower jaw which is the only movable skull bone located in the neck the hyoid bone anchors the tongue and is unique as it doesnt connect to other bones airfilled sinuses in the sphenoid ethmoid maxillary and frontal bones lighten the skull and amplify voice resonance newborns skulls feature fontanelles soft areas allowing skull flexibility during birth which gradually ossify as the child grows this intricate structure provides vital protection structural support and pathways for sensory and respiratory functions contributing to the bodys stability and balance
appendicular skeleton the appendicular skeleton consists of the shoulder girdle with the upper limbs and the pelvic girdle with the lower limbs fig 166 shoulder girdle and upper limb each shoulder girdle consists of 1 clavicle 1 scapula each upper limb consists of the following bones 1 humerus 1 radius 1 ulna 8 carpal bones 5 metacarpal bones 14 phalanges clavicle or collar bone fig 1628 the clavicle is a long bone which has a double curve it articulates with the manubrium of the sternum at the sternodavicular joint and forms the acromiodavicular joint with the acromion process of the scapula the clavicle provides the only bony link between the upper limb and the axial skeleton scapula or shoulder blade fig 1629 the scapula is a flat triangularshaped bone lying on the posterior chest wall superficial to the ribs and separated from them by muscles at the lateral angle there is a shallow articular surface the glenoid cavity which with the head of the humerus forms the shoulder joint on the posterior surface there is a spinous process that projects beyond the lateral angle of the bone that overhangs the shoulder joint called the acromion process it articulates with the clavicle at the acromiodavicular joint the coracoid process a projection from the upper border of the bone gives attachment to muscles that move the shoulder joint humerus fig 1630 this is the bone of the upper arm the head articulates with the glenoid cavity of the scapula forming the shoulder joint distal to the head there are two roughened projections of bone the greater and lesser tubercles and between them there is a deep groove the bicipital groove or intertubercular sulcus occupied by one of the tendons of the biceps muscle the distal end of the bone presents two surfaces that articulate with the radius and ulna to form the elbow joint ulna and radius fig 1631 these are the two bones of the forearm the ulna is longer than and medial to the radius and when the arm is in the anatomical position ie with the palm of the hand facing forward the two bones are parallel they articulate with the humerus at the elbow joint the carpal bones at the wrist joint and with each other at the proximal and distal radioulnar joints carpal or wrist bones fig 1632 there are eight carpal bones arranged in two rows of four from outside inwards they are proximal row scaphoid lunate triquetral pisiform distal row trapezium trapezoid capitate hamate these bones are closely fitted together and held in position by ligaments which allow a certain amount of movement between them the bones of the proximal row are associated with the wrist joint and those of the distal row form joints with the metacarpal bones tendons of muscles lying in the forearm cross the wrist and are held close to the bones by strong fibrous bands called retinacula see fig 178 p 420 metacarpal bones or the bones of the hand these five bones form the palm of the hand they are numbered from the thumb side inwards the proximal ends articulate with the carpal bones and the distal ends with the phalanges phalanges or finger bones there are 14 phalanges three in each finger and two in the thumb they articulate with the metacarpal bones and with each other pelvic girdle and lower limb the bones of the pelvic girdle are 2 innominate bones 1 sacrum the bones of the lower limb are 1 femur 7 tarsal bones 1 tibia 5 metatarsal bones 1 fibula 14 phalanges 1 patella innominate or hip bones fig 1633 each hip bone consists of three fused bones the ilium ischium and pubis on its outer surface there is a deep depression the acetabulum which forms the hip joint with the almostspherical head of femur the ilium is the upper flattened part of the bone and it presents the iliac crest the anterior point of which is called the anterior superior iliac spine the pubis is the anterior part of the bone and it articulates with the pubis of the other hip bone at a cartilaginous joint the symphysis pubis the ischium is the inferior and posterior part the union of the three parts takes place in the acetabulum the pelvis fig 1634 the pelvis is formed by the two innominate bones which articulate anteriorly at the symphysis pubis and posteriorly with the sacrum at the sacroiliac joints which are synovial joints it is divided into two parts by the brim of the pelvis consisting of the promontory of the sacrum and the iliopectineal lines of the innominate bones the greater or false pelvis is above the brim and the lesser or true pelvis is below differences between male and female pelves fig 1635 the shape of the female pelvis allows for the passage of the baby during childbirth in comparison with the male pelvis the female pelvis has lighter bones is more shallow and rounded and is generally more roomy femur or thigh bone fig 1636 the femur is the longest and strongest bone of the body the head is almost spherical and fits into the acetabulum of the hip bone to form the hip joint in the centre of the head there is a small depression for the attachment of the ligament of the head of the femur this extends from the acetabulum to the femur and contains a blood vessel that supplies blood to an area of the head of the bone the neck extends outwards and slightly downwards from the head to the shaft and most of it is within the capsule of the hip joint the posterior surface of the lower third forms a flat triangular area called the popliteal surface the distal extremity has two articular condyles which with the tibia and patella form the knee joint tibia or shin bone fig 1637 the tibia is the medial of the two bones of the lower leg the proximal extremity is broad and flat and presents two condoles for articulation with the femur at the knee joint the head of the fibula articulates with the inferior aspect of the lateral condyle forming the proximal tibiofibular joint the distal extremity of the tibia forms the ankle joint with the talus and the fibula the medial malleolus is a downward projection of bone medial to the ankle joint fibula fig 1637 the fibula is the long slender lateral bone in the leg the head or upper extremity articulates with the lateral condyle of the tibia forming the proximal tibiofibular joint and the lower extremity articulates with the tibia then projects beyond it to form the lateral malleolus patella or knee cap this is a roughly triangularshaped sesamoid bone associated with the knee joint its posterior surface articulates with the patellar surface of the femur in the knee joint and its anterior surface is in the patellar tendon ie the tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle tarsal or ankle bones fig 1638 there are seven tarsal bones which form the posterior part of the foot they are 1 talus 3 cuneiform 1 calcaneus 1 cuboid 1 navicular the talus articulates with the tibia and fibula at the ankle joint the calcaneus forms the heel of the foot the other bones articulate with each other and with the metatarsal bones metatarsal bones of the foot fig 1638 these are five bones numbered from within outwards which form the greater part of the dorsum of the foot at their proximal ends they articulate with the tarsal bones and at their distal ends with the phalanges the enlarged distal head of the 1st metatarsal bone forms the ball of the foot phalanges of the toes fig 1638 there are 14 phalanges arranged in a similar manner to those in the fingers ie two in the great toe the halux and three in each of the other toes arches of the foot the arrangement of the bones of the foot is such that it is not a rigid structure this point is well illustrated by comparing a normal foot with a flat foot the bones have a bridgelike arrangement and are supported by muscles and ligaments so that four arches are formed a medial and lateral longitudinal arch and two transverse arches medial longitudinal arch this is the highest of the arches and is formed by the calcaneus talus navicular three cuneiform and first three metatarsal bones only the calcaneus and the distal end of the metatarsal bones should touch the ground lateral longitudinal arch the lateral arch is much less marked than its medial counterpart the bony components are the calcaneus cuboid and the two lateral metatarsal bones again only the calcaneus and metatarsal bones should touch the ground transverse arches these run across the foot and can be more easily seen by examining the skeleton than the live model they are most marked at the level of the three cuneiform and cuboid bones muscles and ligaments which support the arches of the foot fig 1639 as there are movable joints between all the bones of the foot very strong muscles and ligaments are necessary to maintain the strength resilience and stability of the foot during walking running and jumping posterior tibialis muscle this is the most important muscular support of the medial longitudinal arch it lies on the posterior aspect of the lower leg originates from the middle third of the tibia and fibula and its tendon passes behind the medial malleolus to be inserted into the navicular cuneiform cuboid and metatarsal bones it acts as a sling or suspension apparatus for the arch short muscles of the foot this group of muscles is mainly concerned with the maintenance of the lateral longitudinal and transverse arches they make up the fleshy part of the sole of the foot plantar calcaneonavicular ligament or spring ligament this is a very strong thick ligament stretching from the calcaneus to the navicular bone it plays an important part in supporting the medial longitudinal arch plantar ligaments and interosseous membranes these structures support the lateral and transverse arches,the appendicular skeleton supports limb movement and includes the shoulder girdle with the upper limbs and the pelvic girdle with the lower limbs the shoulder girdle consists of the clavicle and scapula connecting the upper limbs to the axial skeleton each upper limb includes a humerus upper arm radius and ulna forearm bones 8 carpals wrist 5 metacarpals hand and 14 phalanges fingers the clavicle provides structural support while the scapula allows extensive shoulder mobility the pelvic girdle includes the fused ilium ischium and pubis bones that form the hip socket or acetabulum for articulation with the femur each lower limb includes the femur thigh tibia shin fibula lateral leg patella kneecap 7 tarsals ankle 5 metatarsals foot and 14 phalanges toes the arches of the footmedial lateral and transverseform a flexible structure critical for movement muscles and ligaments such as the posterior tibialis and plantar calcaneonavicular ligament maintain these arches providing stability for activities like walking and running
healing of bones bone fractures are classified as simple the bone ends do not protrude through the skin compound the bone ends protrude through the skin pathological fracture of a bone weakened by disease following a fracture the broken ends of bone are joined by the deposition of new bone this occurs in several stages fig 1640 a haematoma forms between the ends of bone and in surrounding soft tissues there follows development of acute inflammation and accumulation of macrophages which phagocytose the haematoma inflammatory exudate and small fragments of bone without blood supply this takes about 5 days fibroblasts migrate to the site granulation tissue and new capillaries develop new bone forms as large numbers of osteoblasts secrete woven nonlamellar bone p 390 which is then quickly organised into lamellar bone and calcified forming a callus after about a week osteoblasts and osteoclasts remain active and the callus matures reuniting the bone ends after about 3 weeks reshaping of the bone continues and gradually the medullary canal is reopened through the callus in weeks or months in time the bone heals completely regaining its original features osteoblasts and osteoclasts are no longer present factors that delay healing of fractures tissue fragments between the ends of bone splinters of dead bone sequestrae and soft tissue fragments not removed by phagocytosis delay healing deficient blood supply this delays growth of granulation tissue and new blood vessels hypoxia also reduces the number of osteoblasts and increases the number of chondrocytes that develop from their common parent cells this may lead to cartilagenous union of the fracture which results in a weaker repair the most vulnerable sites because of their normally poor blood supply are the neck of femur the scaphoid and the shaft of tibia poor alignment of bone ends this may result in the formation of a large and irregular callus which heals slowly and often results in permanent disability continued mobility of bone ends continuous movement results in fibrosis of the granulation tissue followed by fibrous union of the fracture miscellaneous these include infection see below systemic illness malnutrition drugs eg corticosteroids ageing complications of fractures infection osteomyelitis microbes gain access through broken skin although they may occasionally be bloodborne p 410 healing will not occur until the infection resolves fat embolism emboli consisting of fat from the marrow in the medullary canal may enter the circulation through torn veins they are most likely to lodge in the lungs diseases of bones osteoporosis in this condition bone mass the amount of bone tissue is reduced because its deposition does not keep pace with resorption peak bone mass occurs around 35 years and then gradually declines in both sexes lowered oestrogen levels after the menopause are associated with a period of accelerated bone loss in women thereafter bone density in women is less than in men for any given age bone is progressively weakened with cancellous bone affected first by thinning and loss of trabeculae in the postmenopausal period an imbalance of hormones probably causes bone weakening ie between anabolic steroids oestrogen and androgens and antianabolic steroids glucocorticoids a range of environmental factors and diseases are associated with decreased bone mass and are implicated in development of osteoporosis box 161 some can be influenced by changes in lifestyle exercise and calcium intake during childhood and adolescence are thought to be important in determining eventual bone mass of an individual as bone mass decreases susceptibility to fractures increases immobility causes reversible osteoporosis the extent of which corresponds to the area of impaired movement eg localised following immobilisation of a fractured limb or around a joint affected by rheumatoid arthritis generalised in eg prolonged unconsciousness common features of osteoporosis are skeletal deformity gradual loss of height with age which is caused by compression of vertebrae bone pain fractures especially of the hip neck of femur wrist colles fracture and vertebrae pagets disease this disease can affect one bone part of a bone or many bones osteocytes reabsorb excess bone softening the tissue and then overactive osteoblasts deposit abnormal new bone that is thickened or enlarged and structurally weak this predisposes to deformities and fractures commonly of the pelvis femur tibia and skull most cases occur after 40 years and the incidence increases with age the cause is unknown and it often goes undetected until complications arise these include bone pain bony deformities eg bowing of the tibia and femur fractures that are pathological spontaneous or follow minor trauma osteoarthritis due to bony deformities especially in the hip joint osteosarcoma which often occurs in the elderly and is associated with a poor prognosis p 411 compression of nerves in the diminished cranial foramina due to thickening of the bones eg compression of the vestibulocochlear nerve causing deafness rickets and osteomalacia rickets occurs in children and osteomalacia in adults after ossification is complete they are caused by deficiency of vitamin d which promotes calcification of bone and absorption of calcium in the small intestine see p 274 and table 111 p 276 deficiency may be due to dietary deficiency of vitamin d malabsorption eg coeliac disease or following gastrointestinal surgery lack of exposure to sunlight eg pigmented skin housebound people excessive loss of vitamin d or its precursors eg in chronic renal failure haemodialysis drugs that result in breakdown of vitamin d eg anticonvulsants including phenytoin in rickets osteoid is deposited but calcification is incomplete although growth of the epiphyseal cartilage continues growth is stunted the bones remain soft and those of the lower limbs become bowed by the weight of the body in osteomalacia there is increased and abnormal turnover of bone as in rickets osteoid is not calcified and the bones become soft bowed and prone to fractures infection of bones osteomyelitis microbes gain access to bones through the skin in compound fractures by spread from a local focus of infection eg from an infected prosthesis or tooth abscess via the blood commonly from a boil or paronychia infection of the nail bed during a surgical procedure the most common infecting organism is staphylococcus aureus which typically affects the growth regions of long bones in children infection of soft tissues of the feet common in elderly diabetics may spread to the bones infection of the bone causes inflammation that may completely resolve in more severe cases healing may be delayed by the presence of sequestra pieces of dead bone in the wound complications include bone necrosis suppuration pus formation local spread to the periosteum and then to surrounding soft tissues and joints this may be followed by formation of a subperiosteal abscess that ruptures forming a sinus discharging pus to the skin which in chronic cases can continue for several years developmental abnormalities of bone achondroplasia this is caused by a genetic abnormality there is abnormal growth of cartilage especially the epiphyseal cartilage of long bones leading to characteristic dwarfism and underdevelopment of the bones of the base of the skull fig 1641 osteogenesis imperfecta brittle bone syndrome this is a group of conditions in which there is a congenital defect of osteoblasts resulting in failure of ossification the bones are brittle and fracture easily either spontaneously or following very slight trauma tumours of bone benign tumours single or multiple tumours may develop for unknown reasons in bone and cartilage they may cause pathological fractures or pressure damage to soft tissues eg a benign vertebral tumour may damage the spinal cord or a spinal nerve benign tumours of cartilage have a tendency to undergo malignant change malignant tumours metastatic tumours the most common malignancies of bone are metastases of primary carcinomas of the breast lungs thyroid kidneys and prostate gland the usual sites are those with the best blood supply ie cancellous bone especially the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae and the epiphyses of the humerus and femur tumour fragments are spread in blood and possibly along the walls of the veins from pelvic tumours to vertebrae the effects of the malignancy may be destruction of bone leading to pathological fractures collapse of vertebrae causing damage to the spinal cord andor spinal nerves m fibrosis of bone anaemia leukopenia and thrombocytopenia but in most cases the link is not known primary tumours osteosarcoma this is a rapidly growing and often metastatic tumour believed to develop from the precursors of osteogenic cells in young people between 10 and 25 years of age the tumour develops most commonly in the medullary canal of long bones especially the femur it is usually well advanced before it becomes evident in older people usually over 60 years of age it is often associated with pagets disease and the bones most commonly affected are the vertebrae skull and pelvis chondrosarcoma these relatively slowgrowing tumours are usually the result of malignant change in benign tumours of cartilage cells they occur mainly between the ages of 40 and 70 years,bone fractures heal in a multistep process initially a hematoma forms around the broken ends followed by inflammation where macrophages remove debris fibroblasts create granulation tissue and osteoblasts lay down a woven bone structure forming a callus that matures within weeks gradually reshaping and restoring the bone healing may be delayed by poor blood supply infection misaligned bone ends or continuous bone movement bone diseases vary widely osteoporosis involves reduced bone mass increasing fracture risk especially after menopause pagets disease disrupts normal bone formation leading to enlarged but weak bones often in the pelvis femur or skull rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults result from vitamin d deficiency causing soft easily fractured bones infections like osteomyelitis introduce bacteria to bone often from open fractures delaying healing and leading to complications developmental abnormalities include achondroplasia which affects cartilage growth and results in dwarfism and osteogenesis imperfecta a genetic disorder where bones are extremely brittle bone tumors can be benign causing fractures or soft tissue damage or malignant such as osteosarcoma in young people and chondrosarcoma in older adults leading to severe bone destruction
the joints a joint is the site at which any two or more bones articulate or come together some joints have no movement fibrous some only slight movement cartilaginous and some are freely movable synovial types of joint fibrous or fixed joints fig 171 these immovable joints have fibrous tissue between the bones eg joints between the bones of the skull sutures and those between the teeth and the maxilla and mandible cartilaginous or slightly movable joints fig 172 there is a pad of fibrocartilage between the ends of the bones that form the joint which allows for very slight movement where the pad of cartilage is compressed examples include the symphysis pubis and the joints between the vertebral bodies synovial or freely movable joints synovial joints have characteristic features that enable a wide range of movements table 171 they are classified according to the range of movement possible or to the shape of the articulating parts of the bones involved ball and socket the head or ball of one bone articulates with a socket of another and the shape of the bones allows for a wide range of movement those possible are flexion extension adduction abduction rotation and circumduction examples are the shoulder and hip hinge joints these allow the movements of flexion and extension only they are the elbow knee ankle the joints between the atlas and the occipital bone and the interphalangeal joints of the fingers and toes gliding joints the articular surfaces glide over each other eg sternoclavicular joints acromioclavicular joints and joints between the carpal bones and those between the tarsal bones pivot joints movement is round one axis rotation eg proximal and distal radioulnar joints and the joint between the atlas and the odontoid process of the axis condyloid and saddle joints movements take place round two axes permitting flexion extension abduction adduction and circumduction eg the wrist temporomandibular metacarpophalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints characteristics of a synovial joint fig 173 all synovial joints have certain characteristics in common articular or hyaline cartilage the parts of the bones which are in contact are always covered with hyaline cartilage it provides a smooth articular surface and is strong enough to absorb compression forces and bear the weight of the body the cartilage lining which is up to 7mm thick in young people becomes thinner and less compressible with age this leads to increasing stress on other structures in the joint cartilage has no blood supply and receives its nourishment from synovial fluid capsule or capsular ligament the joint is surrounded and enclosed by a sleeve of fibrous tissue which holds the bones together it is sufficiently loose to allow freedom of movement but strong enough to protect it from injury synovial membrane this is composed of epithelial cells and is found lining the capsule covering those parts of the bones within the joint not covered by articular cartilage covering all intracapsular structures that do not bear weight synovial fluid this is a thick sticky fluid of eggwhite consistency secreted by synovial membranes into the synovial cavity and it provides nutrients for the structures within the joint cavity contains phagocytes which remove microbes and cellular debris acts as a lubricant maintains joint stability prevents the ends of the bones from being separated as does a little water between two glass surfaces little sacs of synovial fluid or bursae are present in some joints eg the knee they act as cushions to prevent friction between a bone and a ligament or tendon or skin where a bone in a joint is near the surface other intracapsular structures some joints have structures within the capsule but outside the synovial membrane which assist in maintenance of stability eg fat pads and menisci in the knee joint when these structures do not bear weight they are covered by synovial membrane extracapsular structures ligaments that blend with the capsule provide additional stability at most joints muscles or their tendons also provide stability and stretch across the joints they move when the muscle contracts it shortens pulling one bone towards the other nerve and blood supply nerves and blood vessels crossing a joint usually supply the capsule and the muscles that move it main synovial joints of the limbs individual synovial joints have the characteristics described above so only their distinctive features are included in this section shoulder joint fig 174 this ball and socket joint is formed by the glenoid cavity of the scapula and the head of the humerus the capsular ligament is very loose inferiorly to allow for the free movement normally possible at this joint the glenoid cavity is deepened by a rim of fibrocartilage the glenoidd labrum which provides additional stability without limiting movement the tendon of the long head of the biceps muscle lying in the intertubercular bicipital groove of the humerus extends through the joint cavity and is attached to the upper rim of the glenoid cavity it has an important stabilising effect on the joint synovial membrane forms a sleeve round the part of the tendon of the long head of the biceps muscles within the capsular ligament and covers the glenoidal labrum extracapsular structures consist of the coracohumeral ligament extending from the coracoid process of the scapula to the humerus the glenohumeral ligaments which blend with and strengthen the capsule the transverse humeral ligament retaining the biceps tendon in the intertubercular groove the stability of the joint may be reduced if these structures together with the tendon of the biceps muscle are stretched by repeated dislocations of the joint muscles and movements muscles fig 175 coracobrachialis muscle this lies on the upper medial aspect of the arm it arises from the coracoid process of the scapula stretches across in front of the shoulder joint and is inserted into the middle third of the humerus it flexes the shoulder joint deltoid muscle these muscle fibres originate from the clavicle acromion process and spine of scapula and radiate over the shoulder joint to be inserted into the deltoid tuberosity of the humerus it forms the fleshy and rounded contour of the shoulder the anterior fibres cause flexion the middle or main part abduction and the posterior fibres extend the shoulder joint pectoralis major this lies on the anterior thoracic wall the fibres originate from the middle third of the clavicle and from the sternum and are inserted into the lip of the intertubercular groove of the humerus it draws the arm forward and towards the body ie flexes and adducts latissimus dorsi this arises from the posterior part of the iliac crest and the spinous processes of the lumbar and lower thoracic vertebrae it passes upwards across the back then under the arm to be inserted into the bicipital groove of the humerus it adducts medially rotates and extends the arm teres major this originates from the inferior angle of the scapula and is inserted into the humerus just below the shoulder joint it extends adducts and medially rotates

radius extracapsular structures consist of anterior posterior medial and lateral strengthening ligaments muscles fig 175 biceps muscle this lies on the anterior aspect of the upper arm at its proximal end it is divided into two parts heads each of which has its own tendon the short head rises from the coracoid process of the scapula and passes in front of the shoulder joint to the arm the long head originates from the rim of the glenoid cavity and its tendon passes through the joint cavity and the bicipital groove of the humerus to the arm it is retained in the bicipital groove by a transverse ligament which stretches across the groove the distal tendon crosses the elbow joint and is inserted into the radial tuberosity it helps to stabilise and flex the shoulder joint and at the elbow joint it assists with flexion and supination brachialis muscle this lies on the anterior aspect of the upper arm deep to the biceps it originates from the shaft of the humerus extends across the elbow joint and is inserted into the ulna just distal to the joint capsule it is the main flexor of the elbow joint triceps muscle this lies on the posterior aspect of the humerus it arises from three heads one from the scapula and two from the posterior surface of the humerus the insertion is by a common tendon to the olecranon process of the ulna it helps to stabilise the shoulder joint assists in adduction of the arm and extends the elbow joint movements flexion biceps and brachialis extension triceps proximal and distal radioulnar joints the proximal radioulnar joint formed by the rim of the head of the radius rotating in the radial notch of the ulna is in the same capsule as the elbow joint the annular ligament is a strong extracapsular ligament which encircles the head of the radius and keeps it in contact with the radial notch of the ulna fig 176b the distal radioulnar joint is a pivot joint between the distal end of the radius and the head of the ulna fig 177 muscles and movements muscles fig 175 pronator teres this lies obliquely across the upper third of the front of the forearm it arises from the medial epicondyle of the humerus and the coronoid process of the ulna and passes obliquely across the forearm to be inserted into the lateral surface of the shaft of the radius it rotates the radioulnar joints changing the hand from the anatomical to the writing position ie pronation supinator muscle this lies obliquely across the posterior and lateral aspects of the forearm its fibres arise from the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and the upper part of the ulna and are inserted into the lateral surface of the upper third of the radius it rotates the radioulnar joints changing the hand from the writing to the anatomical position ie supination it lies deep to the muscles shown in figure 175 movements pronation pronator teres supination supinator and biceps,joints are the points where two or more bones connect classified into three main types based on their movement capabilities fibrous joints these immovable joints have a solid connection via fibrous tissue exemplified by the sutures in the skull cartilaginous joints slightly movable joints feature a pad of fibrocartilage that allows minimal movement as seen in the symphysis pubis and between vertebrae synovial joints freely movable joints with distinct structures that facilitate a wide range of motion key characteristics include articular cartilage smooth hyaline cartilage covering the ends of bones reducing friction and absorbing shock capsule a fibrous sleeve encasing the joint providing stability while allowing movement synovial membrane this layer secretes synovial fluid nourishing the cartilage and lubricating the joint bursae fluidfilled sacs that cushion areas of friction between bones and tendons synovial joints are categorized by their shape and movement including ballandsocket joints eg shoulder and hip and hinge joints eg elbow and knee important muscles such as the biceps and triceps facilitate movements like flexion extension and rotation
wrist joint fig 177 this is a condyloid joint between the distal end of the radius and the proximal ends of the scaphoid lunate and triquetral a disc of white fibrocartilage separates the ulna from the joint cavity and articulates with the carpal bones it also separates the inferior radioulnar joint from the wrist joint extracapsular structures consist of medial and lateral ligaments and anterior and posterior radiocarpal ligaments muscles and movements muscles fig 175 flexor carpi radialis this lies on the anterior surface of the forearm it originates from the medial epicondyle of the humerus and is inserted into the second and third metacarpal bones it flexes the wrist joint and when acting with the extensor carpi radialis abducts the joint flexor carpi ulnaris this lies on the medial aspect of the forearm it originates from the medial epicondyle of the humerus and the upper parts of the ulna and is inserted into the pisiform the hamate and the fifth metacarpal bones it flexes the wrist and when acting with the extensor carpi ulnaris adducts the joint extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis these lie on the posterior aspect of the forearm the fibres originate from the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and are inserted by a long tendon into the second and third metacarpal bones they extend and abduct the wrist extensor carpi ulnaris this lies on the posterior surface of the forearm it originates from the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and is inserted into the fifth metacarpal bone it extends and adducts the wrist movements flexion flexor carpi radialis and the flexor carpi ulnaris extension extensors carpi radialis longus and brevis and the extensor carpi ulnaris abduction flexor and extensors carpi radialis adduction flexor and extensor carpi ulnaris joints of the hands and fingers there are synovial joints between the carpal bones between the carpal and metacarpal bones between the metacarpal bones and proximal phalanges and between the phalanges the powerful movements that occur at these joints are produced by muscles in the forearm which have tendons extending into the hand many of the finer movements of the fingers are produced by numerous small muscles in the hand the flexor retinaculum is a strong fibrous band that stretches across the front of the carpal bones enclosing their concavity and forming the carpal tunnel the tendons of flexor muscles of the wrist joint and the fingers and the median nerve pass through the carpal tunnel the retinaculum holding them close to the bones synovial membrane forms sleeves around these tendons in the carpal tunnel and extends some way into the palm of the hand synovial sheaths also enclose the tendons on the flexor surfaces of the fingers synovial fluid prevents friction that might damage the tendons as they move over the bones fig 178 the extensor retinaculum is a strong fibrous band that extends across the back of the wrist tendons of muscles that extend the wrist and finger joints are encased in synovial membrane under the retinaculum the synovial sheaths are less extensive than on the flexor aspect the synovial fluid secreted prevents friction hip joint fig 179 this ball and socket joint is formed by the cupshaped acetabulum of the innominate bone and the almost spherical head of the femur the capsular ligament includes most of the neck of the femur the cavity is deepened by the acetabular labrum a ring of fibrocartilage attached to the rim of the acetabulum this adds stability to the joint without limiting its range of movement the ligament of the head of the femur extends from the shallow depression in the middle of the head of the femur to the acetabulum it conveys a blood vessel to the head of the femur synovial membrane covers both sides of the acetabular labrum and forms a sleeve around the ligament of the head of the femur there are three important ligaments that surround and strengthen the capsule they are the iliofemoral ischiofemoral and pubofemoral ligaments muscles and movements muscles figs 1710 and 1711 psoas muscle this arises from the transverse processes and bodies of the lumbar vertebrae it passes across the flat part of the ilium and behind the inguinal ligament to be inserted into the femur together with the iliacus it flexes the hip joint fig 1710 iliacus muscle this lies in the iliac fossa of the innominate bone it originates from the iliac crest passes over the iliac fossa and joins the tendon of the psoas muscle to be inserted into the lesser trochanter of the femur the combined action of iliacus and psoas flexes the hip joint quadriceps femoris this is a group of four muscles lying on the front and sides of the thigh they are the rectus femoris and three vasti the rectus femoris originates from the ilium and the three vasti from the upper end of the femur together they pass over the front of the knee joint to be inserted into the tibia by the patellar tendon only the rectus femoris flexes the hip joint together the group acts as a very strong extensor of the knee joint gluteal muscles these consist of the glutens maximus medius and minimus which together form the fleshy part of the buttock they originate from the ilium and sacrum and are inserted into the femur they cause extension abduction and medial rotation at the hip joint sartorius this is the longest muscle in the body and crosses both the hip and knee joints it originates from the anterior superior iliac spine and passes obliquely across the hip joint thigh and knee joint to be inserted into the medial surface of the upper part of the tibia it is associated with flexion and abduction at the hip joint and flexion at the knee adductor group this lies on the medial aspect of the thigh they originate from the pubic bone and are inserted into the linea aspera of the femur they adduct and medially rotate the thigh movements flexion psoas iliacus rectus femoris and sartorius extension gluteus maximus and the hamstrings abduction gluteus medius and minimus sartorius and others adduction adductor group lateral rotation mainly gluteal muscles and adductor group medial rotation gluteus medius and minimus and others knee joint fig 1712 this is the largest and most complex joint it is a hinge joint formed by the condyles of the femur the condyles of the tibia and the posterior surface of the patella the anterior part of the capsule consists of the tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle which also supports the patella intracapsular structures include two cruciate ligaments that cross each other extending from the intercondylar notch of the femur to the intercondylar eminence of the tibia they help to stabilise the joint semilunar cartilages or menisci are incomplete discs of white fibrocartilage lying on top of the articular condyles of the tibia they are wedgeshaped being thicker at their outer edges they help to stabilise the joint by preventing lateral displacement of the bones bursae and pads of fat are numerous they prevent friction between a bone and a ligament or tendon and between the skin and the patella sy no vial membrane covers the cruciate ligaments and the pads of fat the menisci are not covered with synovial membrane because they are weight bearing the most important strengthening ligaments are the medial and lateral ligaments muscles and movements possible movements at this joint are flexion extension and a rotatory movement which locks the joint when it is fully extended when the joint is locked balance is maintained with less muscular effort than when it is flexed muscles fig 1711 hamstring muscles these lie on the posterior aspect of the thigh they originate from the ischium and are inserted into the upper end of the tibia they are biceps femoris semimembranosus and semitendinosus muscles they flex the knee joint gastrocnemius this forms the bulk of the calf of the leg it arises by two heads one from each condyle of the femur and passes down behind the tibia to be inserted into the calcaneus by the calcanean tendon achilles tendon it crosses both knee and ankle joints causing flexion at the knee and plantarflexion at the ankle quadriceps femoris described above this extends the knee joint movements flexion bending backwards gastrocnemius and hamstrings extension straightening quadriceps femoris muscle ankle joint fig1713 this hinge joint is formed by the distal end of the tibia and its malleolus medial malleolus the distal end of the fibula lateral malleolus and the talus there are four important ligaments strengthening this joint they are the deltoid and anterior posterior medial and lateral ligaments muscles and movements muscles fig 1711 anterior tibialis muscle this originates from the upper end of the tibia lies on the anterior surface of the leg and is inserted into the middle cuneiform bone by a long tendon it is associated with dorsiflexion of the foot soleus this is one of the main muscles of the calf of the leg lying immediately deep to the gastrocnemius it originates from the heads and upper parts of the fibula and the tibia its tendon joins that of the gastrocnemius so that they have a common insertion into the calcaneus by the calcanean achilles tendon it causes plantarflexion at the ankle and helps to stabilise the joint when standing gastrocnemius this described above is a powerful plantarflexor movements flexion dorsiflexion anterior tibialis assisted by the muscles which extend the toes extension plantarflexion gastrocnemius and soleus assisted by the muscles which flex the toes the movements of inversion and eversion occur between the tarsal bones and not at the ankle joint joints of the foot and toes there are a number of synovial joints between the tarsal bones between the tarsal and metatarsal bones between the metatarsals and proximal phalanges and between the phalanges movements are produced by muscles in the leg with long tendons which cross the ankle joint and by muscles of the foot the tendons crossing the ankle joint are encased in synovial sheaths and are held close to the bones by strong transverse ligaments they move smoothly within their sheaths as the joints move in addition to moving the joints of the foot these muscles support the arches of the foot and help to maintain body balance,the wrist joint is a condyloid joint formed by the distal radius and proximal carpal bones scaphoid lunate triquetral with a fibrocartilage disc separating the ulna it allows flexion extension abduction and adduction facilitated by muscles like flexor carpi radialis and ulnaris and extensor carpi radialis and ulnaris the hip joint a ballandsocket joint between the acetabulum and femur is stabilized by ligaments and the acetabular labrum allowing for a wide range of movements key muscles include the psoas iliacus quadriceps and gluteal muscles enabling flexion extension abduction adduction and rotation the knee joint is a complex hinge joint supported by ligaments and menisci facilitating flexion extension and rotation the hamstrings and quadriceps are the primary muscles involved the ankle joint is a hinge joint formed by the tibia fibula and talus strengthened by ligaments movements include dorsiflexion and plantarflexion with muscles like the anterior tibialis gastrocnemius and soleus playing significant roles
disorders of joints the tissues involved in diseases of the synovial joints are synovial membrane hyaline cartilage and bone inflammatory diseases of joints arthritis rheumatoid arthritis ra rheumatoid disease this is a chronic progressive inflammatory autoimmune disease it is a systemic disorder where inflammatory changes not only affect synovial joints but also many other sites including the heart blood vessels and skin it is more common in females than males and can affect all ages including children stills disease although it usually develops between the ages of 35 and 55 years the cause is not clearly understood but development of autoimmunity may be initiated by microbial infection possibly by viruses in genetically susceptible people antigenantibody complexes rheumatoid factors are formed and are often found in the blood and synovial fluid seropositive ra seropositive individuals tend to have a more aggressive form of ra than those without rheumatoid factors ie seronegative ra rheumatoid factors appear early in severe cases of sudden onset and later when the disease develops gradually acute exacerbations of rheumatoid arthritis are usually accompanied by fever and are interspersed with periods of remission the joints most commonly affected are those of the hands and feet but in severe cases most of the synovial joints may be involved with each febrile exacerbation there is additional and cumulative damage to the joints leading to increasing deformity pain and loss of function the primary changes that may be reversible include hypertrophy and hyperplasia of synovial cells and fibrinous inflammatory effusion into the joint if the disease progresses there are further secondary changes which may be irreversible including erosion of articular cartilage and the growth of granulation tissue pannus that separates the bones and distorts the shape of the joint fibrosis of pannus which causes adhesions between the bones limiting movement ossification of the fibrosed pannus further restricting joint movement spread of granulation tissue to tendons weakening and atrophy of muscles possibly due to limited exercise development of rheumatoid nodules subcutaneous collagen nodules outside the joints eg in pressure areas such as the elbow over the knuckles and in the lungs pleura heart and eyes enlargement of lymph nodes and spleen lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly in the later stages of the disease the inflammation and fever are less marked and movement is limited by deformity of the joint muscle weakness and pain the extent of disability varies between slight and severe table 172 highlights differences between osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis other types of polyarthritis this group of autoimmune inflammatory arthritic diseases has many characteristics similar to rheumatoid arthritis but the rheumatoid factor is absent the causes are not known but genetic features may be involved the joints affected are mainly those of the axial skeleton ankylosing spondylitis in this the sacroiliac and vertebral joints become progressively ossified psoriatic arthritis this occurs in a proportion of people who suffer from psoriasis especially if the nails are involved reiters syndrome polyarthritis with urethritis and conjunctivitis this syndrome it is believed may be precipitated by infection with chlamydia tmchomatis the affected joints are usually those of the lower limb rheumatic fever polyarthritis is a common presenting feature often involving the wrists elbows knees and ankles unlike cardiac effects arthritis usually resolves spontaneously without complications p 122 infective arthritis microbes may be carried in the blood to the joints from foci of infection elsewhere in the body in most cases of septic arthritis the joint has been damaged by previous injury or arthritic disease the outcome may be resolution without complications suppuration followed by healing with the formation of fibrous tissue that may become ossified development of chronic infection especially in brucellosis gonorrhoea and tuberculosis traumatic injury to joints sprains strains and dislocations these damage the soft tissues tendons and ligaments round the joint without penetrating the joint capsule in dislocations there may be additional damage to intracapsular structures by stretching eg long head of biceps muscle in the shoulder joint cruciate ligaments in the knee joint ligament of head of femur in the hip joint if repair is incomplete there may be some loss of stability which increases the risk of repeated injury penetrating injuries these may be caused by a compound fracture of one of the articulating bones or trauma caused by eg gun shot healing may be uneventful or it may be delayed by the presence in the joint of tissue fragments or sequestra tiny pieces of bone too large to be removed by phagocytes incomplete healing of torn ligaments inside the capsule infection that may be bloodborne or enter through broken skin when healing is incomplete there is a tendency for irreversible degenerative changes to occur osteoarthritis osteoarthrosis oa this is a degenerative noninflammatory disease that results in pain and restricted movement of affected joints osteoarthrosis is the more appropriate name but is less commonly used articular cartilage gradually becomes thinner because its renewal does not keep pace with its breakdown eventually the bony articular surfaces come in contact and the bones begin to degenerate there is abnormal bone repair and the articular surfaces become misshapen chronic inflammation develops with effusion into the joint possibly due to irritation caused by tissue debris not removed by phagocytes sometimes there is abnormal outgrowth of cartilage at the edges of bones which becomes ossified forming osteophytes primary osteoarthritis this is the more common type and the cause is unknown changes may be due to acceleration of the normal ageing process in joints that have had excessive use it usually develops in late middle age and affects large weightbearing joints ie the hips knees and joints of the cervical and lower lumbar spine in many cases only one joint is involved osteoarthritis of spine this condition is relatively common in the elderly degenerative changes cause narrowing of intervertebral discs and osteophytes may develop round the margins of joints of the vertebral column commonly in the cervical region cervical spondylosis they may cause damage to the nervous system varying from compression of individual spinal nerves to spinal cord injury secondary osteoarthritis this occurs in joints in which cartilage has already been damaged due to congenital deformity of bones eg in congenital dislocation of the hip trauma eg intracapsular fracture of a bone injury to intracapsular structures other conditions eg inflammatory diseases haemophilia following repeated haemorrhages into the joints peripheral nerve lesions gout acromegaly diabetic neuropathy gout this condition is more prevalent in males than females and there is a familial tendency it is caused by the deposition of sodium urate crystals in joints and tendons that provokes an acute inflammatory response it occurs in some people whose blood uric acid is abnormally high due to either overproduction or defective excretion by the kidneys uric acid is a waste product of the breakdown of nucleic acids ie dna and rna and is produced in excess when there is largescale cell destruction eg following trauma or treatment with cytotoxic drugs and in anaemia starvation and malignancy defective excretion occurs in renal failure in many cases only one joint is involved monoarthritis and it is typically red hot and painful the sites most commonly affected are the metatarsophalangeal joint of the big toe and the ankle knee wrist and elbow joints episodes of arthritis lasting days or weeks are interspersed with periods of remission after repeated acute attacks permanent damage may occur with chronic deformity and loss of function of the affected joints gout is sometimes complicated by the development of renal calculi connective tissue diseases this group of disorders has common features they affect many systems of the body especially the joints skin and subcutaneous tissues tend to occur in early adult life usually affect more females than males are chronic conditions are autoimmune diseases in which abnormal autoantibodies are formed that attack the individuals tissues these disorders include the following systemic lupus enthematosus sle in this the affected joints are usually the hands knees and ankles a characteristic red butterfly rash may occur on the face kidney involvement is common and can result in glomerulonephritis that may be complicated by chronic renal failure systemic sclerosis sderoderma this is a group of disorders in which there is progressive thickening of connective tissue there is increased production of collagen that affects many organs in the skin there is dermal fibrosis and tightness that impairs the functioning of joints especially of the hands it also affects the walls of blood vessels intestinal tract and other organs polyarteritis nodosa p 114 rheumatoid arthritis p 425 ankylosing spondylitis p 426 reiters disease p 426 carpal tunnel syndrome this occurs when the median nerve is compressed in the wrist as it passes through the carpal tunnel fig 178 it is a common condition especially in women between the ages of 30 and 50 years there is pain and numbness in the hand and wrist affecting the thumb index and middle fingers and half of the ring finger many cases are idiopathic or secondary to other conditions eg rheumatoid arthritis diabetes mellitus acromegaly and hypothyroidism repetitive flexion and extension of the wrist joint also cause the condition eg following prolonged keyboard use,diseases of synovial joints primarily affect the synovial membrane hyaline cartilage and bone key disorders include rheumatoid arthritis ra a chronic autoimmune disorder affecting joints and other organs symptoms include joint pain deformity and systemic effects it can lead to irreversible joint damage and disability osteoarthritis oa a degenerative joint disease characterized by cartilage breakdown leading to pain and restricted movement it can be primary agerelated or secondary due to prior injury or conditions gout caused by urate crystal deposition in joints resulting in acute inflammation and pain commonly affects the big toe and can lead to chronic damage if untreated infective arthritis results from joint infection often leading to joint damage and complications traumatic injuries include sprains strains and dislocations that can damage surrounding soft tissues without breaching the joint capsule carpal tunnel syndrome caused by median nerve compression in the wrist leading to pain and numbness in the hand often due to repetitive motions
muscles of the face and neck muscles of the face there are many muscles involved in changing facial expression and with movement of the lower jaw during chewing and speaking only the main muscles are described here except where indicated the muscles are present in pairs one on each side occipitofrontalis unpaired this consists of a posterior muscular part over the occipital bone ocdpitalis an anterior part over the frontal bone frontalis and an extensive flat tendon or aponeurosis that stretches over the dome of the skull and joins the two muscular parts it raises the eyebrows levator palpebrae superioris this muscle extends from the posterior part of the orbital cavity to the upper eyelid it raises the eyelid orbicularis oculi this muscle surrounds the eye eyelid and orbital cavity it closes the eye and when strongly contracted screws up the eyes buccinator this flat muscle of the cheek draws the cheeks in towards the teeth in chewing and in forcible expulsion of air from the mouth the trumpeters muscle orbicularis oris unpaired this muscle surrounds the mouth and blends with the muscles of the cheeks it closes the lips and when strongly contracted shapes the mouth for whistling masseter this is a broad muscle extending from the zygomatic arch to the angle of the jaw in chewing it draws the mandible up to the maxilla closing the jaw and exerts considerable pressure on the food temporalis this muscle covers the squamous part of the temporal bone it passes behind the zygomatic arch to be inserted into the coronoid process of the mandible it closes the mouth and assists with chewing pterygoid this muscle extends from the sphenoid bone to the mandible it closes the mouth and pulls the lower jaw forward muscles of the neck there are many muscles situated in the neck but only the two largest are considered here sternocleidomastoid this muscle arises from the manubrium of the sternum and the clavicle and extends upwards to the mastoid process of the temporal bone it assists in turning the head from side to side when the muscle on one side contracts it draws the head towards the shoulder when both contract at the same time they flex the cervical vertebrae or draw the sternum and clavicles upwards when the head is maintained in a fixed position eg in forced respiration trapezius this muscle covers the shoulder and the back of the neck the upper attachment is to the occipital protuberance the medial attachment is to the transverse processes of the cervical and thoracic vertebrae and the lateral attachment is to the clavicle and to the spinous and acromion processes of the scapula it pulls the head backwards squares the shoulders and controls the movements of the scapula when the shoulder joint is in use muscles of the back there are six pairs of large muscles in the back in addition to those that form the posterior abdominal wall the arrangement of these muscles is the same on each side of the vertebral column they are described in chapter 17 trapezius teres major psoas latissimus dorsi quadratus lumborum sacrospinalis quadratus lumborum this muscle originates from the iliac crest then it passes upwards parallel and close to the vertebral column and it is inserted into the 12th rib fig 185 together the two muscles fix the lower rib during respiration and cause extension of the vertebral column bending backwards if one muscle contracts it causes lateral flexion of the lumbar region of the vertebral column sacrospinalis erector spinae this is a group of muscles lying between the spinous and transverse processes of the vertebrae fig 186 they originate from the sacrum and are finally inserted into the occipital bone their contraction causes extension of the vertebral column muscles of the abdominal wall there are six pairs of muscles that form the abdominal wall from the surface inwards they are rectus abdominis external oblique internal oblique transversus abdominis quadratus lumborum psoas described in chapter 17 the anterior abdominal wall is divided longitudinally by a very strong midline tendinous cord the linea alba meaning white cord which extends from the xiphoid process of the sternum to the symphysis pubis the structure of the abdominal wall on each side of the linea alba is identical rectus abdominis this is the most superficial muscle it is broad and flat originating from the transverse part of the pubic bone then passing upwards to be inserted into the lower ribs and the xiphoid process of the sternum medially the two muscles are attached to the linea alba external oblique this muscle extends from the lower ribs downwards and forward to be inserted into the iliac crest and by an aponeurosis to the linea alba internal oblique this muscle lies deep to the external oblique its fibres arise from the iliac crest and by a broad band of fascia from the spinous processes of the lumbar vertebrae the fibres pass upwards towards the midline to be inserted into the lower ribs and by an aponeurosis into the linea alba the fibres are at right angles to those of the external oblique transversus abdominis this is the deepest muscle of the abdominal wall the fibres arise from the iliac crest and the lumbar vertebrae and pass across the abdominal wall to be inserted into the linea alba by an aponeurosis the fibres are at right angles to those of the rectus abdominis functions the main function of the four pairs of muscles is to form the strong muscular anterior wall of the abdominal cavity when the muscles contract together they compress the abdominal organs flex the vertebral column in the lumbar region fig 186 contraction of the muscles on one side only bends the trunk towards that side contraction of the oblique muscles on one side rotates the trunk inguinal canal this canal is 25 to 4 cm long and passes obliquely through the abdominal wall it runs parallel to and immediately in front of the transversalis fascia and part of the inguinal ligament fig 185 in the male it contains the spermatic cord and in the female the round ligament it constitutes a weak point in the otherwise strong abdominal wall through which herniation may occur see p 330 muscles of the pelvic floor the pelvic floor is divided into two identical halves that unite along the midline each half consists of fascia and muscle the muscles are levator ani coccygeus levator ani this is a broad flat muscle forming the anterior part of the pelvic floor they originate from the inner surface of the true pelvis and unite in the midline together they form a sling which supports the pelvic organs coccygeus this is a triangular sheet of muscle and tendinous fibres situated behind the levator ani they originate from the medial surface of the ischium and are inserted into the sacrum and coccyx they complete the formation of the pelvic floor which is perforated in the male by the urethra and anus and in the female by the urethra vagina and anus functions the pelvic floor supports the organs of the pelvis and maintains continence ie it resists raised intrapelvic pressure during micturition and defaecation,the muscles of the face and neck are vital for facial expressions chewing and head movements the occipitofrontalis muscle raises the eyebrows and consists of two parts the occipitalis and frontalis joined by an aponeurosis the levator palpebrae superioris lifts the eyelid while the orbicularis oculi closes the eye the buccinator compresses the cheeks during chewing and the orbicularis oris shapes and closes the lips for whistling and speaking the masseter and temporalis muscles are crucial for jaw movement enabling effective chewing while the pterygoid muscles facilitate jaw protrusion in the neck the sternocleidomastoid allows for head rotation and flexion and the trapezius stabilizes the shoulders and supports head movement the abdominal wall consists of layers including the rectus abdominis external oblique internal oblique and transversus abdominis working together to compress abdominal organs and flex the spine finally the pelvic floor muscles such as the levator ani and coccygeus support pelvic organs and maintain urinary and fecal continence by resisting increased pressure during activities like micturition and defecation
healing of muscle muscle fibres may be damaged accidentally or be cut during surgery the extent of the damage determines the mode and effectiveness of healing in all cases damaged tissue is removed by phagocytosis and replaced by granulation tissue in slight injury the small gap in the muscle fibre is bridged by outgrowths from the surviving ends of the fibre completely restoring its integrity in more extensive injury the muscle fibre outgrowths may not be able to extend far enough into the granulation tissue to restore it completely when this happens the remaining granulation tissue becomes fibrosed and scar tissue forms in time this contracts and may restrict joint movement in very extensive injury repair is by fibrosis in crush syndrome p 436 there may also be serious systemic effects repair of nerves supplying muscles a motor unit consists of a lower motor neurone lmn and the muscle fibres it supplies when the nerve supply is cut the muscle cannot contract and gradually atrophies but if the nerve regenerates muscle fibre function is restored the axon of the lmn in a peripheral nerve divides into numerous terminal branches each of which supplies a muscle fibre in a bundle of muscle fibres the nerve supply is derived from several lmns see fig 710 p 147 nerve supply to muscle fibres may be restored by regeneration of the nerve if cut near the parent cell and if the cut ends are in close apposition fig 188 the outgrowth of new terminal nerve fibres from the other axons supplying adjacent muscle fibres in the same bundle fig 189 when the neurilemma is out of position or destroyed a traumatic neuroma develops in which there is sprouting of axons and schwann cells diseases of muscles myopathies muscular dystrophies in this group of inherited diseases there is progressive degeneration of groups of muscles the main differences in the types are age of onset rate of progression groups of muscles involved duchenne muscular dystrophy inheritance of this condition is sex linked the affected gene being carried on the long x chromosome of female carriers their children may be affected by the condition if they are males 50 chance or be carriers if they are females 50 chance see fig 412 p 76 the muscle abnormality is present before birth but may not be evident until the child is about 5 years of age wasting and weakness begin in muscles of the lower limbs then spread to the upper limbs progressing rapidly without remission death usually occurs in adolescence often from respiratory failure cardiac arrhythmias or cardiomyopathy facioscapulohumeral dystrophy this disease affects both sexes it usually begins in adolescence and the younger the age of onset the more rapidly it progresses muscles of the face and shoulders are affected first this is a chronic condition that usually progresses slowly and may not cause complete disability life expectancy is normal myotonic dystrophy this disease usually begins in adult life and affects both sexes muscles contract and relax slowly often seen as difficulty in releasing an object held in the hand muscles of the tongue and the face are first affected then muscles of the limbs systemic conditions associated with myotonic dystrophy include cataracts atrophy of the gonads cardiomyopathy glucose intolerance the disease progresses without remission and with increasing disability death usually occurs in middle age from respiratory or cardiac failure crush syndrome sustained pressure on the trunk or a limb causes ischaemia resulting in massive muscle necrosis when pressure is relieved and the circulation is restored myoglobin and other necrotic products are released from damaged muscle and enter the blood this material is highly toxic to the kidneys and acute renal failure may develop a common complication of this type of injury is infection especially by anaerobic microbes eg clostridium perfringens cl welchii and other clostridia causing gas gangrene healing of such extensive injury is by fibrosis,muscle healing involves a series of processes dependent on the extent of the damage when muscle fibers are injured they undergo phagocytosis to remove damaged tissue which is replaced by granulation tissue the healing process varies based on injury severity slight injury small gaps in muscle fibers are bridged by growth from surviving fibers restoring muscle integrity moderate injury growth from muscle fibers may not reach granulation tissue entirely leading to fibrosis and scar tissue formation potentially restricting joint movement severe injury extensive damage results in repair by fibrosis often seen in conditions like crush syndrome which can have systemic effects for nerve injuries motor units comprising lower motor neurons lmns and muscle fibers can regenerate if the nerve is cut close to the cell body repair occurs through direct regeneration of the nerve outgrowth from adjacent axons when the nerve is damaged muscle diseases particularly myopathies include conditions like duchenne muscular dystrophy facioscapulohumeral dystrophy and myotonic dystrophy each varying in symptoms age of onset and progression crush syndrome leads to muscle necrosis and can result in severe complications including acute renal failure due to myoglobin release
the reproductive systems the ability to reproduce is one of the properties which distinguishes living from nonliving matter the more primitive the animal the simpler the process of reproduction in human beings the process is one of sexual reproduction in which the male and female organs differ anatomically and physiologically both males and females produce specialised reproductive germ cells called gametes the male gametes are called spermatozoa and the female gametes are called ova they contain the genetic material or genes on chromosomes which pass inherited characteristics on to the next generation in other body cells there are 46 chromosomes arranged in 23 pairs but in the gametes there are only 23 one from each pair gametes are formed by meiosis p 33 when the ovum is fertilised by a spermatozoon the resultant zygote contains 23 pairs of chromosomes one of each pair obtained from the father and one from the mother the zygote embeds itself in the wall of the uterus where it grows and develops during the 40week gestation period before birth the functions of the female reproductive system are formation of female gametes ova reception of male gametes spermatozoa provision of suitable environments for fertilisation of the ovum by spermatozoa and development of the resultant fetus parturition childbirth lactation the production of breast milk which provides complete nourishment for the baby in its early life the functions of the male reproductive system are production of male gametes spermatozoa transmission of spermatozoa to the female female reproductive system external genitalia vulva the external genitalia fig 192 are known collectively as the vulva and consist of the labia majora and labia minora the clitoris the vaginal orifice the vestibule the hymen and the vestibular glands bartholins glands labia majora these are the two large folds which form the boundary of the vulva they are composed of skin fibrous tissue and fat and contain large numbers of sebaceous glands anteriorly the folds join in front of the symphysis pubis and posteriorly they merge with the skin of the perineum at puberty hair grows on the mons pubis and on the lateral surfaces of the labia majora labia minora these are two smaller folds of skin between the labia majora containing numerous sebaceous glands the cleft between the labia minora is the vestibule the vagina urethra and ducts of the greater vestibular glands open into the vestibule clitoris the clitoris corresponds to the penis in the male and contains sensory nerve endings and erectile tissue but it has no reproductive significance hymen the hymen is a thin layer of mucous membrane which partially occludes the opening of the vagina it is normally incomplete to allow for passage of menstrual flow vestibular glands the vestibular glands bartholins glands are situated one on each side near the vaginal opening they are about the size of a small pea and have ducts opening into the vestibule immediately lateral to the attachment of the hymen they secrete mucus that keeps the vulva moist blood supply lymph drainage and nerve supply the arterial supply this is by branches from the internal pudendal arteries that branch from the internal iliac arteries and by external pudendal arteries that branch from the femoral arteries the venous drainage this forms a large plexus which eventually drains into the internal iliac veins lymph drainage this is through the superficial inguinal nodes nerve supply this is by branches from pudendal nerves perineum the perineum is the area extending from the base of the labia minora to the anal canal it is roughly triangular and consists of connective tissue muscle and fat it gives attachment to the muscles of the pelvic floor p 434 internal genitalia the internal organs of the female reproductive system figs 193 and 194 lie in the pelvic cavity and consist of the vagina uterus two uterine tubes and two ovaries vagina the vagina is a fibromuscular tube lined with stratified squamous epithelium connecting the external and internal organs of reproduction it runs obliquely upwards and backwards at an angle of about 45 between the bladder in front and rectum and anus behind in the adult the anterior wall is about 75 cm 3 inches long and the posterior wall about 9 cm long the difference is due to the angle of insertion of the cervix through the anterior wall,the reproductive systems allow for the continuation of life through sexual reproduction involving male and female organs that produce specialized cells or gametes males produce spermatozoa while females produce ova each containing 23 chromosomes fertilization occurs when a spermatozoon fuses with an ovum to form a zygote with 46 chromosomes which then implants in the uterine wall initiating a 40week gestation period female reproductive system functions production of ova receiving sperm providing a fertilization environment supporting fetal development childbirth and lactation female anatomy external genitalia vulva includes labia majora labia minora clitoris hymen and vestibular glands the labia provide structure and lubrication and the clitoris contains sensory nerves internal genitalia includes the vagina a muscular tube connecting external and internal organs uterus uterine tubes and ovaries all located within the pelvic cavity vascular and nerve supply blood is supplied via internal and external pudendal arteries and drained by internal iliac veins pudendal nerves supply sensation
biology of plant propagation introduction the natural world is covered by populations of many different kinds of plants that have evolved over eons of time we identify these as species although there are other divisions that will be described in this text these populations can more or less maintain themselves from generation to generation because of their natural genetic characteristics if not they evolve into other variants or become extinct in agriculture and horticulture on the other hand propagators primarily deal with special kinds of plants which are defined as cultivars varieties 9 we buy thompson seedless grapes and elberta peaches for our table grow queen elizabeth roses and bradford pear trees in our landscape and plant hybrid yellow granex onion seed and marquis wheat in our fields all of these represent populations of plants that are unique and only exist in cultivation these plants would likely change drastically or disappear altogether if not maintained by genetic selection during propagation plant propagation and plant breeding both involve genetic selection the role of the plant breeder is to recreate patterns of genetic variation in its many forms from which to select new kinds of plants useful to humans the role of the plant propagator on the other hand is to multiply these selected cultivars and to do it in such a manner as to maintain the genetic characteristics of the original population to do both requires an understanding of genetic principles and procedures biological life cycles in plants plant life cycles in natural systems plant life cycles can be described based on their life span and reproductive pattern therefore they are referred to as annuals biennials or perennials 1 annuals are plants that complete the entire sequence from germination to seed dissemination and death in one growing season technically annuals are monocarpic meaning that they die after reproducing however annuals also refers to plants that may be perennial in mild climates but are not winter hardy and so die after the first growing season due to cold temperatures 2 biennials are plants that require two growing seasons to complete their life cycle during the first year the plants are vegetative and grow as low clumps or a rosette of leaves these plants usually need a period of cold weather for vernalization of the shoot meristem before they can become reproductive during the second season biennial plants bolt producing a fastgrowing flowering spike flower produce seeds and then die although the terminology is confusing winter annuals fit into this category seeds germinate in late summer forming a seedling with numerous rosette leaves that hug the ground after winter vernalization the meristem bolts flowers sets seeds and dies before summer less than 12 months 3 perennials are plants that live for more than 2 years and repeat the vegetativereproductive cycle annually perennial cycles tend to be related to seasonal cycles of warmcold temperature climates or wetdry periods tropical climates both herbaceous and woody plants can be perennial a herbaceous perennials produce shoots that grow during one season and die back during the winter or periods of drought it may take herbaceous perennials several growing cycles before they become reproductive and they may not flower every year depending on the plants accumulation of resources during the growing cycle plants survive during adverse conditions as specialized underground structures with roots and crown that remain perennial geophytes bulbs corms rhizomes tubers are included in this group bwoody perennials develop permanent aboveground woody stems that continue to increase annually from apical and lateral buds with characteristic growth and dormancy periods woody perennials are trees and shrubs life cycles of seedling cultivars in propagation an individual plant that develops from a seed is referred to as a seedling whether it is an annual biennial herbaceous perennial or woody perennial during the life cycle of a seedling the sequence of growth and development is separated into four broad phases fig 1a 10 25 29 46 phase i embryonic this phase begins with the formation of a zygote this cell grows into an embryo which receives nourishment from the mother plant through physiological stages of development at first growth involves cell division of the entire embryo as it increases in size later growth potential develops with a polar orientation as the embryo develops its characteristic structure phase ii juvenile seed germination initiates a dramatic change from the embryonic pattern to the developmental pattern of the young seedling vegetative growth is now polar extending in two directions via the shoot and root axis cell division is concentrated in the root tips shoot tips and axillary growing points subsequently the extension of the root and shoot is accompanied by an increase in volume new nodes are continually laid down as leaves and axillary growing points are produced lateral growing points produce only shoots that are not competent to flower the juvenile period is the growth stage where plants cannot flower even though the inductive flowering signals are present in the environment 33 61 phase iii transition the vegetative period at the end of the juvenile phase and prior to the reproductive stage is marked by subtle changes in growth and morphology growth tends to decrease as the plants enter the reproductive period when flowering occurs the important point is that the developmental potential of the growing points is sensitive to particular signals partly internal although often dictated by cues from the environment such as changes in day length and chilling phase iv adult or mature during this phase shoot meristems have the potential to develop flower buds and the plant produces flowers fruits and seeds the duration and expression of these phases represent fundamental variation in plant development which is analogous to comparable phases in animal development the most conspicuous expression of phases occurs in longlived perennial plants such as trees and shrubs where conspicuous differences in juvenile and mature traits may be observed in the same plant nevertheless phase changes have been identified in annual plants such as maize 61 and must be recognized as a fundamental aspect of all plant development the following characteristics of plant development are associated with phase change time of flowering 52 79 85 the age when flowering begins is the most characteristic aspect of phase change time of first flowering varies from days to a few months in some annuals to as much as 50 years in some perennials table 1 usually flowering begins in the upper and peripheral parts of the tree where shoots and branches have attained the prerequisite phase morphological expression of leaves and other structures leaf form in the juvenile phase sometimes differs radically from that of the adult phase fig 2 english ivy is a classic example of phase change as illustrated in figures 3 and 4 juvenile parts of apple pear and citrus seedlings may be very thorny although the trait disappears in the adult phase 33 80 potential for regeneration 34 80 each phase tends to have a differing potential for regeneration for instance cuttings taken from the juvenile phase usually have a higher potential for rooting than do cuttings from the adult phase life cycles of apomictic cultivars apomixis is a natural reproductive process possessed by some species of plants in which the embryo develops directly from specific vegetative cells of some part of the reproductive structure that has not undergone meiosis 50 the result is that an asexual process has replaced the normal sexual process life cycles of clonal cultivars two essential aspects characterize clonal life cycles fig 1b 46 a clone originates by vegetative propagation from an individual plant using various types of vegetative propagules the basic kinds are bud scion cutting layer bulb corm tuber and explant depending on their history and origin each of these propagules may represent a different phase of the seedling cycle the phasepotential of the propagule is maintained during vegetative propagation such that the progeny plants may vary significantly in their morphological characteristics for instance figure 4 compares the appearance of a plant propagated from the juvenile and mature phase of english ivy and chamaecyparis taxonomy organisms are named in a hierarchical system described as their taxonomy a sample hierarchy is provided for apple table 2 the basic system for naming plants was introduced by linnaeus fig 4 as the latin system of binomial nomenclature using a genus and species name for each plant each of which are italicized the genus describes a group of plants that are similar in morphological biochemical and genetic properties the species is used to designate a population of plants within a genus that can be recognized and reproduced as a unit 51 the rules for naming plants are maintained by the international association of plant taxonomists under the longstanding international code of botanical nomenclature httpibotsavskicbnmain in nature individuals within one species normally interbreed freely but do not interbreed well with members of another species geographical isolation or some physiological morphological or genetic barrier prevents gene exchange between them a true species can usually be propagated and maintained by seed but may require some control during propagation cultivated plants may also be designated by binomial name even though they may be a complex hybrid rather than a distinct natural species 51 72 for example peach cultivars are variations within a recognized species prunus persica l but the european prune prunus domestica l is a complex hybrid that apparently developed in cultivation cultivars may also be derived from repeated vegetative propagation of an initial desirable mutation the rules for naming cultivated plants are spelled out in the international code of nomenclature for cultivated plants 9 eastern redbud illustrates the various subgroups occurring in selected or natural populations within a species fig 6 botanical variety varietas in latin cercis canadensis var alba cultivar cercis canadensis cv forest pansy or forest pansy in some cases breeders have been able to make genetic crosses between different species or even between genera interspecific hybrids within a genus are designated with an x between the genus and species ie viburnum xburkwoodii which is a hybrid between v carlesii andv utile intergeneric hybrids are formed between genera within a family and are designated with an x before the new genus name which is a contraction of the two genera names ie xfatshedera lizei is an intergeneric hybrid between fatsia japonica and hedera helix there are a number of web sites that provide information on current taxonomy for plant names names for new plants should be registered with the proper registration authority the international society for horticultural sciences provides a home for the commission for nomenclature and cultivar registration httpwwwishsorgsciicrahtm they provide a link to individuals or organizations that maintain the registry for a single genus or group of plants for example the registry for english ivy hedera is maintained by the american ivy society while woody plants without specific registries are handled by the american public gardens association,biology of plant propagation plant propagation is essential for maintaining and replicating specific plant cultivars especially in agriculture and horticulture while plants naturally sustain themselves through genetic adaptation or evolution cultivars require human intervention for their propagation to preserve their unique traits plant breeders work to create genetic diversity for selecting valuable plant types while propagators focus on multiplying these selections retaining genetic characteristics plant life cycles annuals complete their life cycle in one season dying after reproduction biennials require two seasons with a vegetative first year and reproductive second year perennials survive multiple years undergoing repeated vegetativereproductive cycles which vary between herbaceous and woody types phases of seedling life cycle embryonic zygote forms develops into an embryo juvenile seed germinates plants grow but cannot flower transition prepares for reproduction growth slows adult reaches reproductive maturity produces flowers and seeds propagation types seedling cultivars propagate from seeds with phasebased growth apomictic cultivars embryo develops without sexual reproduction clonal cultivars use vegetative propagation eg buds cuttings to replicate exact genetic copies taxonomy and naming plants are categorized hierarchically by genus and species maintained by botanical naming codes cultivars often stem from complex hybrids or mutations and require accurate naming for identification
structure of the vagina the vagina has three layers an outer covering of areolar tissue a middle layer of smooth muscle and an inner lining of stratified squamous epithelium that forms ridges or rugae it has no secretory glands but the surface is kept moist by cervical secretions between puberty and the menopause lactobacillus acidophilus bacteria are normally present which secrete lactic acid maintaining the ph between 49 and 35 the acidity inhibits the growth of most other microbes that may enter the vagina from the perineum blood supply lymph drainage and nerve supply arterial supply an arterial plexus is formed round the vagina derived from the uterine and vaginal arteries which are branches of the internal iliac arteries venous drainage a venous plexus situated in the muscular wall drains into the internal iliac veins lymph drainage this is through the deep and superficial iliac glands nerve supply this consists of parasympathetic fibres from the sacral outflow sympathetic fibres from the lumbar outflow and somatic sensory fibres from the pudendal nerves functions of the vagina the vagina acts as the receptacle for the penis during coitus and provides an elastic passageway through which the baby passes during childbirth uterus the uterus is a hollow muscular pearshaped organ flattened anteroposteriorly it lies in the pelvic cavity between the urinary bladder and the rectum fig 194 in most women it leans forward anteversiori and is bent forward anteflexiori almost at right angles to the vagina so that its anterior wall rests partly against the bladder below and forming the vesicouterine pouch between the two organs when the body is in the upright position the uterus lies in an almost horizontal position it is about 75 cm long 5 cm wide and its walls are about 25 cm thick it weighs from 30 to 40 grams the parts of the uterus are the fundus body and cervix fig 193 the fundus this is the domeshaped part of the uterus above the openings of the uterine tubes the body this is the main part it is narrowest inferiorly at the internal os where it is continuous with the cervix the cervix neck of the uterus this protrudes through the anterior wall of the vagina opening into it at the external os structure of the uterus the walls of the uterus are composed of three layers of tissue perimetrium myometrium and endometrium fig 195 perimetrium this is peritoneum which is distributed differently on the various surfaces of the uterus fig 194 anteriorly it extends over the fundus and the body where it is folded on to the upper surface of the urinary bladder this fold of peritoneum forms the vesicouterine pouch posteriorly the peritoneum extends over the fundus the body and the cervix then it continues on to the rectum to form the rectouterine pouch of douglas laterally only the fundus is covered because the peritoneum forms a double fold with the uterine tubes in the upper free border this double fold is the broad ligament which at its lateral ends attaches the uterus to the sides of the pelvis myometrium this is the thickest layer of tissue in the uterine wall it is a mass of smooth muscle fibres interlaced with areolar tissue blood vessels and nerves endometrium this consists of columnar epithelium containing a large number of mucussecreting tubular glands it is divided functionally into two layers the functional layer is the upper layer and it thickens and becomes rich in blood vessels in the first half of the menstrual cycle if the ovum is not fertilised and does not implant this layer is shed during menstruation the basal layer lies next to the myometrium and is not lost during menstruation it is the layer from which the fresh functional layer is regenerated during each cycle the upper twothirds of the cervical canal is lined with this mucous membrane further towards the vagina however the mucosa changes becoming stratified squamous epithelium which is continuous with the lining of the vagina itself blood supply lymph drainage and nerve supply the arterial supply this is by the uterine arteries which are branches of the internal iliac arteries they pass up the lateral aspects of the uterus between the two layers of the broad ligaments they supply the uterus and uterine tubes and join with the ovarian arteries to supply the ovaries branches pass downwards to anastomose with the vaginal arteries to supply the vagina venous drainage the veins follow the same route as the arteries and eventually drain into the internal iliac veins lymph drainage there are deep and superficial lymph vessels which drain lymph from the uterus and the uterine tubes to the aortic lymph nodes and groups of nodes associated with the iliac blood vessels nerve supply the nerves supplying the uterus and the uterine tubes consist of parasympathetic fibres from the sacral outflow and sympathetic fibres from the lumbar outflow supports of the uterus the uterus is supported in the pelvic cavity by surrounding organs muscles of the pelvic floor and ligaments that suspend it from the walls of the pelvis supporting structures fig 196 the broad ligaments these are formed by a double fold of peritoneum one on each side of the uterus they hang down from the uterine tubes as though draped over them and at their lateral ends they are attached to the sides of the pelvis the uterine tubes are enclosed in the upper free border and near the lateral ends they penetrate the posterior wall of the broad ligament and open into the peritoneal cavity the ovaries are attached to the posterior wall one on each side blood and lymph vessels and nerves pass to the uterus and uterine tubes between the layers of the broad ligaments the round ligaments these are bands of fibrous tissue between the two layers of broad ligament one on each side of the uterus they pass to the sides of the pelvis then through the inguinal canal to end by fusing with the labia major a the uterosacral ligaments these originate from the posterior walls of the cervix and vagina and extend backwards one on each side of the rectum to the sacrum the transverse cervical ligaments cardinal ligaments these extend one from each side of the cervix and vagina to the side walls of the pelvis the pubocervical fascia this extends forward from the transverse cervical ligaments on each side of the bladder and is attached to the posterior surface of the pubic bones functions of the uterus after puberty the endometrium of the uterus goes through a regular monthly cycle of changes the menstrual cycle which is under the control of hypothalamic and anterior pituitary hormones ch 9 the purpose of the cycle is to prepare the uterus to receive nourish and protect a fertilised ovum the cycle is usually regular lasting between 26 and 30 days if the ovum is not fertilised a new cycle begins with a short period of bleeding menstruation if the ovum is fertilised the zygote embeds itself in the uterine wall the uterine muscle grows to accommodate the developing baby which is called an embryo during its first 8 weeks and a fetus for the remainder of the pregnancy uterine secretions nourish the ovum before it implants in the endometrium and after implantation the rapidly expanding ball of cells is nourished by the endometrial cells themselves this is sufficient for only the first few weeks and the placenta is the organ that takes over thereafter the placenta which is attached to the fetus by the umbilical cord is firmly attached to the wall of the uterus and provides the means by which the growing baby receives oxygen and nutrients and gets rid of its wastes during pregnancy which normally lasts about 40 weeks the muscular walls of the uterus are prevented from contracting and expelling the baby early by high levels of the hormone progesterone secreted by the placenta at the end of pregnancy at term the hormone oestrogen which increases uterine contractility becomes the predominant sex hormone in the blood additionally oxytocin is released from the posterior pituitary and also stimulates the uterine muscle control of oxytocin release is by positive feedback see also fig 95 p 219 during labour the uterus forcefully expels the baby by means of powerful rhythmical contractions uterine tubes fallopian tubes the uterine tubes fig 193 are about 10 cm long and extend from the sides of the uterus between the body and the fundus they lie in the upper free border of the broad ligament and their trumpetshaped lateral ends penetrate the posterior wall opening into the peritoneal cavity close to the ovaries the end of each tube has fingerlike projections called fimbriae the longest of these is the ovarian fimbria which is in close association with the ovary structure of the uterine tubes the uterine tubes have an outer covering of peritoneum broad ligament a middle layer of smooth muscle and are lined with ciliated epithelium blood supply lymph drainage and nerve supply these are the same as for the uterus function of the uterine tubes the uterine tubes convey the ovum from the ovary to the uterus by peristalsis and ciliary movement the mucus secreted by the lining membrane provides ideal conditions for movement of ova and spermatozoa fertilisation of the ovum usually takes place in the uterine tube and the zygote is propelled into the uterus for implantation ovaries the ovaries fig 194 are the female gonads or glands and they lie in a shallow fossa on the lateral walls of the pelvis they are 25 to 35 cm long 2 cm wide and 1 cm thick each is attached to the upper part of the uterus by the ovarian ligament and to the back of the broad ligament by a broad band of tissue the mesovarium blood vessels and nerves pass to the ovary through the mesovarium fig 197 structure of the ovaries the ovaries have two layers of tissue the medulla this lies in the centre and consists of fibrous tissue blood vessels and nerves the cortex this surrounds the medulla it has a framework of connective tissue or stroma covered by germinal epithelium it contains ovarian follicles in various stages of maturity each of which contains an ovum before puberty the ovaries are inactive but the stroma already contains immature primordial follicles which the female has from birth during the childbearing years about every 28 days one ovarian follicle graafian follicle matures ruptures and releases its ovum into the peritoneal cavity this is called ovulation and it occurs during most menstrual cycles fig 197 blood supply lymph drainage and nerve supply arterial supply this is by the ovarian arteries which branch from the abdominal aorta just below the renal arteries venous drainage this is into a plexus of veins behind the uterus from which the ovarian veins arise the right ovarian vein opens into the inferior vena cava and the left into the left renal vein lymph drainage this is to the lateral aortic and preaortic lymph nodes the lymph vessels follow the same route as the arteries nerve supply the ovaries are supplied by parasympathetic nerves from the sacral outflow and sympathetic nerves from the lumbar outflow their precise functions are not yet fully understood functions of the ovaries maturation of the follicle is stimulated by follicle stimulating hormone fsh from the anterior pituitary and oestrogen secreted by the follicle lining cells ovulation is triggered by a surge of luteinising hormone lh from the anterior pituitary which occurs a few hours before ovulation after ovulation the follicle lining cells develop into the corpus luteum yellow body under the influence of lh from the anterior pituitary the corpus luteum produces the hormone progesterone and some oestrogen if the ovum is fertilised it embeds itself in the wall of the uterus where it grows and develops and produces the hormone human chorionic gonadotrophin hcg which stimulates the corpus luteum to continue secreting progesterone and oestrogen for the first 3 months of the pregnancy figs 198 and 199 after which time this function is continued by the placenta if the ovum is not fertilised the corpus luteum degenerates and a new cycle begins with menstruation at the site of the degenerate corpus luteum an inactive mass of fibrous tissue forms called the corpus albicans sometimes more than one follicle matures at a time releasing two or more ova in the same cycle when this happens and the ova are fertilised the result is a multiple pregnancy,the vagina is a muscular canal with three layers an outer areolar tissue layer a middle smooth muscle layer and an inner lining of ridged stratified squamous epithelium it remains acidic due to lactobacillus bacteria which help prevent infection the vagina serves as the passage for childbirth and a site for intercourse the uterus is a pearshaped muscular organ positioned between the bladder and rectum its wall has three layers the perimetrium outer covering myometrium thick muscle layer and endometrium inner layer during each menstrual cycle the functional layer of the endometrium thickens to prepare for a possible pregnancy and sheds if fertilization does not occur the fallopian tubes extend from the uterus with fingerlike fimbriae near the ovaries facilitating the transport of the ovum to the uterus where fertilization typically takes place the ovaries are glandular organs containing follicles that mature in response to folliclestimulating hormone fsh and luteinizing hormone lh during ovulation a mature follicle releases an ovum while the remaining follicle forms the corpus luteum which secretes progesterone to support early pregnancy if fertilization occurs if not the cycle restarts with menstruation
puberty in the female puberty is the age at which the internal reproductive organs reach maturity this is called the menarche and marks the beginning of the childbearing period the ovaries are stimulated by the gonadotrophins from the anterior pituitary follicle stimulating hormone and luteinising hormone the age of puberty varies between 10 and 14 years and a number of physical and psychological changes take place at this time the uterus the uterine tubes and the ovaries reach maturity the menstrual cycle and ovulation begin menarche the breasts develop and enlarge pubic and axillary hair begins to grow there is an increase in the rate of growth in height and widening of the pelvis there is an increase in the amount of fat deposited in the subcutaneous tissue especially at the hips and breasts the menstrual sexual cycle this is a series of events occurring regularly in females every 26 to 30 days throughout the childbearing period of about 36 years fig 1910 the cycle consists of a series of changes that take place concurrently in the ovaries and uterine walls stimulated by changes in the blood concentrations of hormones fig 1910b and d hormones secreted in the cycle are regulated by negative feedback mechanisms the hypothalamus secretes luteinising hormone releasing hormone lhrh which stimulates the anterior pituitary to secrete see table 91 p 216 follicle stimulating hormone fsh which promotes the maturation of ovarian follicles and the secretion of oestrogen leading to ovulation luteinising hormone lh which triggers ovulation stimulates the development of the corpus luteum and the secretion of progesterone the hypothalamus responds to changes in the blood levels of oestrogen and progesterone it is switched off by high levels and stimulated when they are low the average length of the menstrual cycle is about 28 days by convention the days of the cycle are numbered from the beginning of the menstrual phase of the menstrual cycle which usually lasts about 4 days this is followed by the proliferative phase about 10 days then by the secretory phase about 14 days menstrual phase when the ovum is not fertilised the corpus luteum starts to degenerate in the event of pregnancy the corpus luteum is supported by human chorionic gonadotrophin hcg secreted by the developing embryo progesterone and oestrogen levels therefore fall and the functional layer of the endometrium which is dependent on high levels of these ovarian hormones is shed in menstruation fig 1910c the menstrual flow consists of the secretions from endometrial glands endometrial cells blood from the broken down capillaries and the unfertilised ovum high circulating levels of ovarian progesterone and oestrogen inhibit the anterior pituitary blocking the release of fsh and lh and should pregnancy occur then rising oestrogen and progesterone levels therefore prevent the maturation and release of another ovum after degeneration of the corpus luteum however falling levels of oestrogen and progesterone lead to resumed anterior pituitary activity rising fsh levels and the initiation of the next cycle proliferative phase at this stage an ovarian follicle stimulated by fsh is growing towards maturity and is producing oestrogen oestrogen stimulates the proliferation of the functional layer of the endometrium in preparation for the reception of a fertilised ovum the endometrium becomes thicker by rapid cell multiplication accompanied by an increase in the numbers of mucussecreting glands and blood capillaries this phase ends when ovulation occurs and oestrogen production declines secretory phase immediately after ovulation the lining cells of the ovarian follicle are stimulated by lh to develop the corpus luteum which produces progesterone and some oestrogen under the influence of progesterone the endometrium becomes oedematous and the secretory glands produce increased amounts of watery mucus this is believed to assist the passage of the spermatozoa through the uterus to the uterine tubes where the ovum is usually fertilised there is a similar increase in the secretion of watery mucus by the glands of the uterine tubes and by cervical glands which lubricate the vagina the ovum may survive in a fertilisable form for a very short time after ovulation probably as little as 8 hours the spermatozoa deposited in the vagina during coitus may be capable of fertilising the ovum for only about 24 hours although they may survive for several days this means that the period in each cycle during which fertilisation can occur is relatively short the time of ovulation can be determined by observing certain changes in the womans body around this period changes in cervical mucus from thick and dry in consistency to thin elastic and watery are detected and in addition body temperature rises by a small but measurable amount immediately following ovulation some women experience some degree of abdominal discomfort in the middle of the cycle thought to correspond to rupture of the follicle and release of its contents into the abdominal cavity if the ovum is not fertilised menstruation occurs and a new cycle begins if the ovum is fertilised there is no breakdown of the endometrium and no menstrual flow the fertilised ovum zygote travels through the uterine tube to the uterus where it becomes embedded in the wall and produces human chorionic gonadotrophin hcg which is similar to anterior pituitary luteinising hormone this hormone keeps the corpus luteum intact enabling it to continue secreting progesterone and oestrogen for the first 3 to 4 months of the pregnancy inhibiting the maturation of further ovarian follicles fig 199 during that time the placenta develops and produces oestrogen progesterone and gonadotrophins menopause climacteric the menopause usually occurs between the ages of 45 and 55 years marking the end of the childbearing period it may occur suddenly or over a period of years sometimes as long as 10 years and is caused by changes in sex hormone levels the ovaries gradually become less responsive to fsh and lh and ovulation and the menstrual cycle become irregular eventually ceasing several other phenomena may occur at the same time including shortterm unpredictable vasodilatation with flushing sweating and palpitations causing discomfort and disturbance of the normal sleep pattern shrinkage of the breasts axillary and pubic hair become sparse atrophy of the sex organs episodes of uncharacteristic behaviour sometimes occur eg irritability mood changes gradual thinning of the skin loss of bone mass that predisposes to osteoporosis p 409 slow increase in blood cholesterol levels that predisposes postmenopausal women to cardiovascular disorders similar changes occur after bilateral irradiation or surgical removal of the ovaries breasts or mammary glands the breasts or mammary glands are accessory glands of the female reproductive system they exist also in the male but in only a rudimentary form in the female the breasts are small and immature until puberty thereafter they grow and develop to their mature size under the influence of oestrogen and progesterone during pregnancy these hormones stimulate further growth after the baby is born the hormone prolactin from the anterior pituitary stimulates the production of milk and oxytocin from the posterior pituitary stimulates the release of milk in response to the stimulation of the nipple by the sucking baby by a positive feedback mechanism structure of the breast the mammary glands fig 1911 consist of glandular tissue fibrous tissue and fatty tissue each breast consists of about 20 lobes of glandular tissue each lobe being made up of a number of lobules that radiate around the nipple the lobules consist of a cluster of alveoli which open into small ducts and these unite to form large excretory ducts called lactiferous ducts the lactiferous ducts converge towards the centre of the breast where they form dilatations or reservoirs for milk leading from each dilatation or lactiferous sinus is a narrow duct which opens on to the surface at the nipple fibrous tissue supports the glandular tissue and ducts and fat covers the surface of the gland and is found between the lobes the nipple this is a small conical eminence at the centre of the breast surrounded by a pigmented area the areola on the surface of the areola are numerous sebaceous glands montgomerys tubercles which lubricate the nipple during lactation blood supply lymph drainage and nerve supply arterial blood supply the breasts are supplied with blood from the thoracic branches of the axillary arteries and from the internal mammary and intercostal arteries venous drainage this describes an anastomotic circle round the base of the nipple from which branches carry the venous blood to the circumference and end in the axillary and mammary veins lymph drainage see fig 61 p 130 this is mainly into the axillary lymph vessels and nodes lymph may drain through the internal mammary nodes if the superficial route is obstructed nerve supply the breasts are supplied by branches from the 4th 5th and 6th thoracic nerves which contain sympathetic fibres there are numerous somatic sensory nerve endings in the breast especially around the nipple when these touch receptors are stimulated by sucking impulses pass to the hypothalamus and the flow of the hormone oxytocin is increased promoting the release of milk function of the breast the mammary glands are only active during late pregnancy and after the birth of a baby when they produce milk lactation lactation is stimulated by the hormone prolactin p 217,female puberty typically between 1014 years signals reproductive maturity with the onset of the menstrual cycle menarche and development of secondary sexual characteristics like breast enlargement pubic hair growth and widening of hips the menstrual cycle lasting about 28 days has three phasesmenstrual proliferative and secretoryregulated by the hypothalamus and pituitary gland hormones in the menstrual phase the uterine lining sheds if no fertilization occurs the proliferative phase driven by fsh and oestrogen involves thickening of the endometrium and maturation of ovarian follicles culminating in ovulation in the secretory phase lh promotes corpus luteum formation which secretes progesterone preparing the endometrium for potential embryo implantation if fertilization doesnt happen hormone levels drop restarting the cycle menopause occurring around 4555 years marks the end of fertility as the ovaries become less responsive to fsh and lh leading to cessation of ovulation and menstruation the mammary glands primarily active during pregnancy and lactation produce milk through prolactin and oxytocins actions which stimulate milk secretion and release in response to infant suckling
male reproductive system the male reproductive system consists of the following organs fig 1912 448 2 testes in the scrotum 2 epididymides 2 deferent ducts vas deferens 2 spermatic cords 2 seminal vesicles 2 ejaculatory ducts 1 prostate gland 1 penis scrotum the scrotum is a pouch of deeply pigmented skin fibrous and connective tissue and smooth muscle it is divided into two compartments each of which contains one testis one epididymis and the testicular end of a spermatic cord it lies below the symphysis pubis in front of the upper parts of the thighs and behind the penis testes the testes fig 1913a and b are the reproductive glands of the male and are the equivalent of the ovaries in the female they are about 45 cm long 25 cm wide and 3 cm thick and are suspended in the scrotum by the spermatic cords they are surrounded by three layers of tissue the tunica vaginalis this is a double membrane forming the outer covering of the testes and is a downgrowth of the abdominal and pelvic peritoneum during early fetal life the testes develop in the lumbar region of the abdominal cavity just below the kidneys they then descend into the scrotum taking with them coverings of peritoneum blood and lymph vessels nerves and the deferent duct the peritoneum eventually surrounds the testes in the scrotum and becomes detached from the abdominal peritoneum descent of the testes into the scrotum should be complete by the 8th month of fetal life the tunica albuginea this is a fibrous covering beneath the tunica vaginalis that surrounds the testes ingrowths form septa dividing the glandular structure of the testes into lobules the tunica vasculosa this consists of a network of capillaries supported by delicate connective tissue structure of the testes in each testis are 200 to 300 lobules and within each lobule are 1 to 4 convoluted loops composed of germinal epithelial cells called seminiferous tubules between the tubules there are groups of interstitial cells of ley dig that secrete the hormone testosterone after puberty at the upper pole of the testis the tubules combine to form a single tubule this tubule about 6 m in its full length is repeatedly folded and tightly packed into a mass called the epididymis it leaves the scrotum as the deferent duct vas deferens in the spermatic cord blood and lymph vessels pass to the testes in the spermatic cords functions of the testes spermatozoa sperm are produced in the seminiferous tubules of the testes and mature as they pass through the long and convoluted epididymis where they are stored the hormone controlling sperm production is fsh from the anterior pituitary p 218 a mature sperm fig 1914 has a head a body and a long whiplike tail that is used for motility the head is almost completely filled by the nucleus containing its dna it also contains the enzymes required to penetrate the outer layers of the ovum to reach and fuse with its nucleus the body of the sperm is packed with mitochondria which fuel the propelling action of the tail that powers the sperm on its journey into the female reproductive tract successful spermatogenesis takes place at a temperature about 3c below normal body temperature the testes are cooled by their position outside the abdominal cavity and the thin outer covering of the scrotum has very little insulating fat the spermatic cords the spermatic cords suspend the testes in the scrotum each cord contains a testicular artery testicular veins lymphatics a deferent duct and testicular nerves which come together to form the cord from their various origins in the abdomen the cord which is covered in a sheath of smooth muscle and connective and fibrous tissues extends through the inguinal canal p 433 and is attached to the testis on the posterior wall the testicular artery this branches from the abdominal aorta just below the renal arteries the testicular vein this passes into the abdominal cavity the left vein opens into the left renal vein and the right into the inferior vena cava lymph drainage this is through lymph nodes around the aorta the deferent duct this is some 45 cm long it passes upwards from the testis through the inguinal canal and ascends medially towards the posterior wall of the bladder where it is joined by the duct from the seminal vesicle to form the ejaculatory duct fig 1915 the nerve supply this is provided by branches from the 10th and llth thoracic nerves seminal vesicles the seminal vesicles are two small fibromuscular pouches lined with columnar epithelium lying on the posterior aspect of the bladder fig 1915 at its lower end each seminal vesicle opens into a short duct which joins with the corresponding deferent duct to form an ejaculatory duct functions of the seminal vesicles the seminal vesicles contract and expel their stored contents seminal fluid during ejaculation seminal fluid which forms 60 of the bulk of the fluid ejaculated at male orgasm contains nutrients to support the sperm during their journey through the female reproductive tract ejaculatory ducts the ejaculatory ducts are two tubes about 2 cm long each formed by the union of the duct from a seminal vesicle and a deferent duct they pass through the prostate gland and join the prostatic urethra carrying seminal fluid and spermatozoa to the urethra fig 1915 the ejaculatory ducts are composed of the same layers of tissue as the seminal vesicles prostate gland the prostate gland fig 1915 lies in the pelvic cavity in front of the rectum and behind the symphysis pubis surrounding the first part of the urethra it consists of an outer fibrous covering a layer of smooth muscle and glandular substance composed of columnar epithelial cells functions of the prostate gland the prostate gland secretes a thin milky fluid that makes up about 30 of semen and gives it its milky appearance it is slightly alkaline which provides a protective local environment for sperm arriving in the acidic vagina it also contains a clotting enzyme which thickens the semen in the vagina increasing the likelihood of semen being retained in the vicinity of the cervix urethra and penis urethra the male urethra provides a common pathway for the flow of urine and semen the combined secretions of the male reproductive organs it is about 19 to 20 cm long and consists of three parts the prostatic urethra originates at the urethral orifice of the bladder and passes through the prostate gland the membranous urethra is the shortest and narrowest part and extends from the prostate gland to the bulb of the penis after passing through the perineal membrane the spongiose or penile urethra lies within the corpus spongiosum of the penis and terminates at the external urethral orifice in the glans penis there are two urethral sphincters fig 1916 the internal sphincter consists of smooth muscle fibres at the neck of the bladder above the prostate gland the external sphincter consists of skeletal muscle fibres surrounding the membranous part penis the penis fig 1916 has a root and a body the root lies in the perineum and the body surrounds the urethra it is formed by three cylindrical masses of erectile tissue and involuntary muscle the erectile tissue is supported by fibrous tissue and covered with skin and has a rich blood supply the two lateral columns are called the corpora cavernosa and the column between them containing the urethra is the corpus spongiosum at its tip it is expanded into a triangular structure known as the glans penis just above the glans the skin is folded upon itself and forms a movable double layer the foreskin or prepuce arterial blood is supplied by deep dorsal and bulbar arteries of the penis which are branches from the internal pudendal arteries a series of veins drain blood to the internal pudendal and internal iliac veins the penis is supplied by autonomic and somatic nerves parasympathetic stimulation leads to filling of the spongy erectile tissue with blood caused by arteriolar dilatation and venoconstriction which increases blood flow into the penis and obstructs outflow the penis therefore becomes engorged and erect an essential prerequisite for coitus to occur ejaculation during ejaculation which occurs at the point of male orgasm spermatozoa are expelled from the epididymis and pass through the deferent duct the ejaculatory duct and the urethra the semen is propelled by powerful rhythmical contraction of the smooth muscle in the walls of the deferent duct the muscular contractions are sympathetically mediated muscle in the walls of the seminal vesicles and prostate gland also contracts adding their contents to the fluid passing through the genital ducts the force generated by these combined processes leads to emission of the semen through the external urethral sphincter fig 1917 sperm comprise only 10 of the final ejaculate the remainder being made up of seminal and prostatic fluids which are added to the sperm during male orgasm as well as mucus produced in the urethra between 2 and 5 ml of semen are produced in a normal ejaculate and contain between 40 and 100 million spermatozoa per ml if not ejaculated sperm gradually lose their fertility after several months and are reabsorbed by the epididymis,male reproductive system the male reproductive system is designed for sperm production and transport key organs include the testes scrotum epididymides vas deferens seminal vesicles prostate gland penis and associated ducts scrotum a skincovered pouch holding each testis and epididymis it maintains optimal temperature 3c below body temperature for sperm production testes located in the scrotum these glands produce sperm in seminiferous tubules and testosterone via interstitial cells testes are divided by septa into 200300 lobules and descend into the scrotum during fetal development epididymis coiled tubes where sperm mature and are stored spermatic cord suspends the testes containing vessels and nerves seminal vesicles glands producing seminal fluid providing nutrients for sperm which comprises about 60 of ejaculate prostate gland adds alkaline fluid to semen aiding sperm survival in the acidic vaginal environment penis and urethra the penis with erectile tissue facilitates sperm deposition during intercourse while the urethra transports both urine and semen ejaculation is a coordinated release of sperm and seminal fluids propelled by muscle contractions producing semen with 40100 million sperm per ml in normal ejaculate
puberty in the male this occurs between the ages of 10 and 14 luteinising hormone from the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland stimulates the interstitial cells of the testes to increase the production of testosterone this hormone influences the development of the body to sexual maturity the changes which occur at puberty are growth of muscle and bone and a marked increase in height and weight enlargement of the larynx and deepening of the voice it breaks growth of hair on the face axillae chest abdomen and pubis enlargement of the penis scrotum and prostate gland maturation of the seminiferous tubules and production of spermatozoa the skin thickens and becomes more oily in the male fertility and sexual ability tend to decline gradually with ageing the secretion of testosterone gradually declines usually beginning at about 50 years of age there is no period comparable to the female menopause sexually transmitted disease venereal disease infection of the reproductive system may be classified as nonspecific usually caused by a mixture of microbes eg staphylococci streptococci coliform bacteria clostridium perfringens cl welchii specific caused by sexually transmitted microbes the most common of which being neisseria gonorrhoeae trichomonas vaginalis chlamydia herpes viruses human immunodeficiency virus hiv and hepatitis b in general the microbes that cause sexually transmitted diseases are unable to survive outside the body for long periods have no intermediate host produce lesions in the genital area which discharge the infecting microbes chlamydia the microbe chlamydia trachomatis causes inflammation of the female cervix which may ascend through the reproductive tract and cause pelvic inflammatory disease and urethritis in the male which may also ascend and lead to epididymitis chlamydia infection is often present in conjunction with other sexually transmitted diseases the same organism causes trachoma an infection of the eye that is the primary cause of blindness worldwide p 210 gonorrhoea this is the most commonly occurring venereal disease and affects men and women it is caused by neisseria gonorrhoeae which affects the mucosa of the reproductive and urinary tracts in the male suppurative urethritis occurs and the infection may spread to the prostate gland epididymis and testes in the female the infection may spread from vulvar glands vagina and cervix to the body of the uterus uterine tubes ovaries and peritoneum healing by fibrosis in the female may cause obstruction of the uterine tubes leading to infertility in the male it may cause urethral stricture nonvenereal transmission of gonorrhoea may cause neonatal ophthalmia in babies born to infected mothers the eyes are infected as the baby passes through the vagina syphilis this disease is caused by treponema pallidum there are three clearly marked stages although the third is now rarely seen in britain after an incubation period of several weeks the primary sore chancre appears at the site of infection eg the vulva vagina perineum penis or round the mouth in the female the primary sore may be undetected if it is internal after several weeks the chancre subsides spontaneously secondary lesions appear 3 to 4 months after infection they consist of skin rashes and raised papules condylomata lata on the external genitalia and vaginal walls these subside after several months and are followed by a latent period of a variable number of years tertiary lesions gummas develop in many organs and in a few cases the nervous system is involved leading to general paralysis sexual transmission occurs during the primary and secondary stages when discharge from lesions contains microbes congenital transmission occurs when microbes from an infected mother cross the placenta to the fetus often with fatal consequences accidental spread of infection may occur by blood transfusion if a donors blood is taken during the incubation period after microbes have spread to the blood from the site of infection trichomonas vaginalis these protozoa cause acute vulvovaginitis it is usually sexually transmitted and is commonly present in women with gonorrhoea candidiasis the yeast candida albicans see also p 319 is frequently a commensal in the normal vagina and causes no problems it is normally prevented from flourishing by eg vaginal acidity but in certain circumstances it proliferates causing candidiasis thrush common precipitating factors include antibiotic therapy which kills the bacteria that keep vaginal ph low pregnancy reduced immune function acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids and hepatitis b infection these viral conditions may be sexually transmitted but there are no local signs of infection for a description of aids and hiv see page 385 and hepatitis b page 334,male puberty and sexually transmitted diseases stds male puberty puberty typically begins between ages 1014 in males it is marked by increased luteinizing hormone lh from the pituitary gland which stimulates testosterone production in the testes testosterone drives changes including increased muscle and bone growth height and weight enlargement of the larynx deepening of the voice and growth of facial chest and pubic hair maturation of seminiferous tubules leading to sperm production increased oil production and thickening of the skin testosterone levels and fertility gradually decline with age but unlike females males do not experience a clear menopausal phase sexually transmitted diseases stds stds can be nonspecific involving microbes like staphylococci and coliforms or specific spread through sexual contact by pathogens like neisseria gonorrhoeae chlamydia trachomatis and viruses hiv hepatitis b chlamydia caused by chlamydia trachomatis leading to urethritis in males and potentially pelvic inflammatory disease in females gonorrhea n gonorrhoeae infects the mucosa leading to painful urination in males and potentially infertility in females syphilis treponema pallidum causes lesions in primary and secondary stages untreated it can damage various organs trichomoniasis protozoan trichomonas vaginalis causes vulvovaginitis often cooccurring with gonorrhea candidiasis overgrowth of candida albicans due to altered ph or immune function can lead to thrush
diseases of the female reproductive system pelvic inflammatory disease pid this infection may be specific or nonspecific it usually begins as vulvovaginitis including the vulvar glands then it may spread to the cervix uterus uterine tubes and ovaries upward spread is most common when microbes are present in the vagina before a surgical procedure childbirth or abortion especially if some of the products of conception are retained complications of pid include infertility due to obstruction of uterine tubes peritonitis intestinal obstruction due to adhesions between the bowel and the uterus andor uterine tubes bacteraemia which may lead to meningitis endocarditis or suppurative arthritis bartholins gland abscess or cyst formation if the duct is blocked vulvar dystrophies atrophic dystrophy this is thinning of vulvar epithelium and the formation of fibrous tissue occurring after the menopause due to oestrogen withdrawal it predisposes to infection especially in debilitated women and to malignant epithelial neoplasia vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia vin the extent of development of hyperplasia and dysplasia of cells of the skin of the vulva varies considerably it is often associated with human papilloma virus infection in the majority of cases the neoplasia are benign some vin cases progress to invasive carcinoma while others regress spontaneously in elderly women and immunosuppressed young women malignant tumours may develop which spread locally with early involvement of inguinal lymph nodes because of the anastomoses between lymph vessels on the two sides of the vulva bilateral lymph node involvement is common imperforate hymen this is a congenital abnormality which may not be noticed until the onset of menstruation when complete imperforate the hymen forms a barrier in the vagina blood accumulates in the vagina uterus and uterine tubes with each menstrual cycle and it may enter the peritoneal cavity and cause peritonitis the uterine tubes may become obstructed by coagulated blood leading to infertility disorders of the cervix cervical carcinoma dysplastic changes referred to as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia cin begin in the deepest layer of cervical epithelium usually at the junction of the stratified squamous epithelium of the lower third of the cervical canal with the secretory epithelium of the upper twothirds dysplasia may progress to involve the full thickness of epithelium called carcinomainsitu the cancer may develop further and spread locally to the vagina uterine body and other pelvic structures more widespread metastases occur late in the disease not all cases in which dysplastic changes are observed develop to the cancerous stage but it is not possible to predict how far development will go and whether it will remain static or regress three degrees of dysplasia have been described although clear distinction between them is not always possible cin 1 mild dysplasia cin 2 moderate dysplasia cin 3 carcinomainsitu cin 3 may progress to invasive carcinoma early spread is via lymph nodes and local spread is commonly to the uterus vagina bladder and rectum in the late stages spread via the blood to the liver lungs and bones may occur the disease takes 15 to 20 years to develop and it occurs mostly between 35 and 50 years of age it is likely that a significant proportion of cases are due to the transmission of some carcinogenic factor to the female during sexual intercourse this is supported by the observations that the disease occurs more frequently in women who commence sexual activity at an early age who have many partners who have many pregnancies or have frequent sexual intercourse additionally barrier contraceptives protect against the disease the human papillomavirus hpv which causes genital warts is strongly associated with this cancer see also p 369 disorders of the uterine body acute endometritis this is usually caused by nonspecific infection following parturition or abortion especially if fragments of membranes or placenta have been retained in the uterus a variety of microbes may be involved eg staphylococci streptococci escherichia coli or pseudomonas the inflammation may subside after removal of retained products the infection may spread to myometrium perimetrium and surrounding pelvic tissues which may lead to thrombosis of iliac veins uterine tubes causing salpingitis fibrosis obstruction and infertility any of the abovementioned areas causing peritonitis and possibly adhesions chronic endometritis this may follow an acute attack or be due to spread of pelvic inflammatory disease it may follow abortion or parturition and may be associated with chronic salpingitis endometrial carcinoma or the use of intrauterine contraceptive devices endometriosis this is the growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterus most commonly in the ovaries uterine tubes and other pelvic structures the ectopic tissue like the uterine endometrium is responsive to the fluctuations in sex hormone levels of the menstrual cycle causing menstrualtype bleeding into the lower abdomen and in the ovaries the formation of coloured cysts chocolate cysts there is intermittent pain due to swelling and recurrent haemorrhage causes fibrous tissue formation ovarian endometriosis may lead to pelvic inflammation infertility and extensive pelvic adhesions involving the ovaries uterus uterine ligaments and the bowel the cause is not clear but it has been suggested that there may have been abnormal cell differentiation in the fetus regurgitation of menstrual material through the uterine tubes spread of endometrial cells in lymph and blood during menstruation adenomyosis this is the growth of endometrium within the myometrium the ectopic tissue may cause general or localised uterine enlargement the lesions may cause dysmenorrhoea and irregular excessive bleeding menorrhagia usually beginning between 40 and 50 years of age endometrial hyperplasia the hyperplasia may affect endometrial glands causing cyst formation andor focal hyperplasia of atypical cells the focal type frequently undergoes malignant change both types are associated with a sustained high blood oestrogen level which may be due to failure of ovarian follicles to mature and release their ova oestrogensecreting ovarian tumours prolonged oestrogen therapy leiomyoma fibroid myoma these are very common often multiple benign tumours of myometrium they are firm masses of smooth muscle encapsulated in compressed muscle fibres and they vary greatly in size large tumours may undergo degenerative changes if they outgrow their blood supply leading to necrosis fibrosis and calcification they develop during the reproductive period and may be hormone dependent enlarging during pregnancy and when oral contraceptives are used they tend to regress after the menopause large tumours may cause pelvic discomfort frequency of micturition menorrhagia irregular bleeding dysmenorrhoea and reduced fertility malignant change is rare endometrial carcinoma this occurs mainly in nulliparous women ie women who have never been pregnant between 50 and 60 years of age the cause is not known but there is some evidence that oestrogen may be involved the incidence of carcinoma is increased when an oestrogensecreting tumour is present and in women who are obese hypertensive or diabetic because they tend to have a high level of blood oestrogen the tumour may develop as a diffuse mass a localised plaque or a polyp and there is often ulceration and bleeding endometrium has no lymphatics so lymph spread is delayed until there is extensive local spread that involves other pelvic structures distant metastases spread in blood or lymph develop later most commonly in the liver lungs and bones invasion of the ureters leads to hydronephrosis and uraemia which is commonly the cause of death disorders of the uterine tubes and ovaries acute salpingitis salpingitis is inflammation of the uterine tubes and is usually due to infection spreading from the uterus and only occasionally from the peritoneal cavity the outcome may be uneventful recovery chronic inflammation leading to fibrous tubal obstruction and infertility pus formation pyosalpinx and further spread to the ovaries and peritoneal cavity leading to fibrous tubal obstruction infertility andor pelvic adhesions ectopic pregnancy this is the implantation of a fertilised ovum outside the uterus most commonly in a uterine tube as the fetus grows the tube ruptures and its contents enter the peritoneal cavity causing acute inflammation peritonitis and possibly severe intraperitoneal haemorrhage ovarian tumours the majority of ovarian tumours are benign usually occurring between 20 and 45 years of age the remainder occur mostly between 45 and 65 years and are divided between borderline malignancy lowgrade cancer and frank malignancy there are three main types of cells involved epithelial cells germ cells and hormonesecreting cells sexcord stroma cells epithelial cell tumours most of these are borderline or malignant tumours they vary greatly in size from very large to quite small and some are partly cystic large tumours may cause pressure leading to gastrointestinal disturbances frequency of micturition dysuria and ascites those suspended by a pedicle may twist causing ischaemia necrosis haemorrhage or rupture of a cyst the principal methods of spread are invasion of local and peritoneal structures later lymph and bloodspread metastases may develop the prevalence is higher in developed societies and in the higher socioeconomic groups pregnancy and suppression of ovulation by medicinal contraceptives eg the oral contraceptive pill may have a protective effect due to a reduction in the number of ovulatory menstrual cycles germ cell ovarian tumours these occur mainly in children and young adults and only a few are malignant benign dermoid cysts are the most common type these are thickwalled cysts containing a variety of uncharacteristic tissues eg hair skin epithelium or teeth they are usually small and have a tendency to twist on a pedicle causing ischaemia and necrosis sexcord stroma cell tumours these cells are the precursors of the ovarian follicle lining cells luteal cells and fibrous supporting cells mixed tumours develop some of which secrete hormones oestrogensecreting tumours cause precocious sexual development in children in adults the excess oestrogen may cause endometrial hyperplasia endometrial carcinoma cystic disease of the breast or breast cancer androgensecreting tumours occasionally develop causing atrophy of the breast and genitalia and the development of male sex characteristics metastatic ovarian tumours the ovaries are a common site of metastatic spread from primary malignant tumours in other pelvic organs the breast stomach pancreas and biliary tract female infertility this may be due to blockage of uterine tubes often the consequence of pelvic inflammatory disease anatomical problems eg retroversion tilting backwards of the uterus endocrine factors any abnormalities of the glands and hormones governing the menstrual cycle can interfere with for example ovulation or the uterine cycle low body weight or severe malnourishment endometriosis disorders of the breast mastitis inflammation of the breast acute nonsuppurative mastitis this occurs during lactation and is associated with painful congestion and oedema of the breast it is of hormonal origin acute suppurative pyogenic mastitis the microbes enter through a nipple abrasion caused by the infant sucking the most common causative microbes are staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes usually acquired by the infant while in hospital the infection spreads along the mammary ducts of a lobe causing localised swelling and redness if it does not resolve it can become chronic and an abscess may form tumours of the breast benign tumours most breast tumours 90 are benign fibroadenomas are the commonest type and occur any time after puberty incidence peaks in the third decade some are cystic and some solid and they usually occur in women nearing the menopause they may originate from secretory cells fibrous tissue or from ducts malignant tumours the most common types of tumour are usually painless lumps found in the upper outer quadrant of the breast there is considerable fibrosis around the tumour that may cause retraction of the nipple and necrosis and ulceration of the overlying skin it is increasingly common between 35 and 70 years early spread beyond the breast is via lymph to the axillary and internal mammary nodes local invasion involves the pectoral muscles and the pleura bloodspread metastases may occur later in many organs and bones especially lumbar and thoracic vertebrae the causes of breast cancer are not known but an important predisposing factor appears to be high oestrogen exposure women with an early menarche a late menopause and no pregnancies have a higher than normal risk because they experience more menstrual cycles in their lifetimes and each monthly cycle brings with it the oestrogen surge seen in the proliferative phase of the cycle a genetic component is also likely with close relatives of cancer sufferers having a significantly elevated risk of developing the disease one per cent of all breast cancer occurs in men,diseases of the female reproductive system pelvic inflammatory disease pid this infection often begins as vulvovaginitis and can ascend to the cervix uterus and ovaries commonly after surgical procedures or childbirth complications may include infertility due to uterine tube obstruction peritonitis and the formation of abscesses vulvar disorders atrophic dystrophy occurs postmenopause due to decreased estrogen leading to vulvar thinning and increased infection risk vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia vin often associated with hpv can progress to invasive carcinoma cervical and uterine disorders cervical carcinoma arises from dysplastic changes known as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia cin often linked to early sexual activity and hpv exposure endometriosis involves the growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterus causing pain and infertility leiomyoma or fibroids are benign tumors of the myometrium often hormonesensitive and prevalent during reproductive years ovarian and breast disorders ovarian tumors can be benign or malignant with risk increasing after menopause breast cancer commonly presents as a painless lump particularly in the upper outer quadrant with lymphatic spread early in the disease risk factors include prolonged estrogen exposure and genetic predisposition
diseases of the male reproductive system infections of the penis inflammation of the glans and prepuce may be caused by a specific or nonspecific infection in nonspecific infections or balanitis lack of personal hygiene is an important predisposing factor especially if phimosis is present ie the orifice in the foreskin prepuce is too small to allow for its normal retraction if the infection becomes chronic there may be fibrosis of the foreskin which increases the phimosis infections of the urethra gonococcal urethritis is the most common specific infection nonspecific infection may be spread from the bladder cystitis or be introduced during catheterisation cystoscopy or surgery both types may spread throughout the system to the prostate seminal vesicles epididymis and testes if infection becomes chronic fibrosis may cause urethral stricture or obstruction leading to retention of urine epididymis and testes infections nonspecific epididymitis and orchitis are usually due to spread of infection from the urethra commonly following prostatectomy the microbes may spread either through the deferent duct vas deferens or via lymph specific epididymitis this is usually caused by gonorrhoea spread from the urethra orchitis inflammation of the testis this is more commonly caused by mumps viruses bloodborne from the parotid glands acute inflammation with oedema occurs about 1 week after the appearance of parotid swelling the infection is usually unilateral but if bilateral severe damage to germinal epithelium of the seminiferous tubules may result in sterility undescended testis cryptorchidism during embryonic life the testes develop within the abdominal cavity but descend into the scrotum prior to birth if they fail to do this and the condition is not corrected infertility is likely to follow and the risk of testicular cancer is increased hydrocele this is the most common form of scrotal swelling and is accumulation of serous fluid in the tunica vaginalis the onset may be acute and painful or chronic it may be congenital or be secondary to another disorder of the testis or epididymis testicular tumours most testicular tumours are malignant and are the commonest malignancies in young men they occur in children and young adults in whom the affected testis has not descended or has been late in descending into the scrotum the tumour tends to remain localised for a considerable time but eventually spreads in lymph to pelvic and abdominal lymph nodes and more widely in blood occasionally hormonesecreting tumours develop and may cause precocious development in children prostate gland infections acute prostatitis is usually caused by nonspecific infection spread from the urethra or bladder often following catheterisation cystoscopy urethral dilatation or surgery in which part of the gland is removed chronic infection may follow an acute attack but it may develop insidiously and is not associated with known microbes fibrosis of the gland may occur during healing causing urethral stricture or obstruction benign prostatic enlargement hyperplastic nodules form around the urethra and may cause constriction or obstruction to the flow of urine causing retention of urine urethral stricture may prevent the bladder emptying completely during micturition predisposing to infection which may spread upwards and cause pyelonephritis and other complications prostatic enlargement is common in men over 50 affecting up to 70 of men aged over 70 the cause is not clear but it may be an acceleration of the ageing process associated with the decline in androgen secretion which changes the androgenoestrogen balance malignant prostatic tumours these are a relatively common cause of death in men over 50 the carcinogen is not known but changes in the androgenoestrogen balance may be significant or viruses may be involved invasion of local tissues is widespread before lymphspread metastases develop in pelvic and abdominal lymph nodes bloodspread metastases in bone are common and bone formation rather than bone destruction is a common feature lumbar vertebrae are a common site possibly due to retrograde spread along the walls of veins in many cases bone metastases are the first indication of malignant prostatic tumours breast breast tissue in men consists of ducts and stroma only gynaecomastia this is proliferation of breast tissue in men it usually affects only one breast and is benign it is common in adolescents and older men and is often associated with endocrine disorders especially those associated with high oestrogen levels cirrhosis of the liver p 335 malnutrition some drugs eg chlorpromazine spironolactone digoxin klinefelters syndrome a genetic disorder in which there is testicular atrophy and absence of spermatogenesis malignant tumours these develop in a small number of men usually in the older age groups male infertility this may be due to endocrine disorders obstruction of the deferent duct failure of erection or ejaculation during intercourse surgical vasectomy suppression of spermatogenesis by eg ionising radiation chemotherapy and other drugs,diseases of the male reproductive system infections inflammation of the penis known as balanitis often results from poor hygiene especially in cases of phimosis urethritis can arise from gonococcal infections or be introduced during medical procedures potentially leading to complications like urethral strictures epididymitis and orchitis typically stemming from infections in the urethra can result in chronic pain and infertility with mumps virus often causing unilateral orchitis undescended testis cryptorchidism if the testes do not descend into the scrotum before birth the risk of infertility and testicular cancer increases hydrocele this condition involves fluid accumulation in the tunica vaginalis leading to scrotal swelling which may be painful or chronic testicular tumors predominantly malignant these tumors commonly affect young men particularly those with undescended testes and may metastasize to lymph nodes and blood prostate conditions acute prostatitis typically follows nonspecific infections while benign prostatic enlargement affects many older men potentially leading to urinary complications malignant prostatic tumors are common in older males and can metastasize to bones often being asymptomatic initially male infertility this may result from hormonal disorders obstruction surgical procedures or effects from medications and radiation

divided into a two parts interphase and mitosis interphase is composed of three phases g1 s and g2 during the g1 g stands for gap phase there are preparing for cell division are arrested in the g1 phase in order for the cell cycle to proceed there is a critical point referred to as the start where the cell commits to cell division progression through the cell cycle is controlled by proteins called cyclindependent protein kinases the s synthesis phase involves dna replication and synthesis during the second gap phase g2 the cell which now has replicated sets of chromosomes prepares to partition these into two identical daughter cells during the cell division phase of mitosis mitosis is separated into four phases prophase metaphase anaphase and telophase related to the way the chromosomes appear within the dividing cell fig 9 during prophase chromosomes condense and appear as short thickened structures with distinctive morphology size and number the chromosomes exist as homologous pairs of chromatids attached together at their centers by centromeres after the nuclear envelope disappears metaphase spindle fibers form and the chromosomes migrate to the center of the cell in anaphase the mitotic spindle fiber microtubules attached to each chromosome pair at the centromere contract pulling the chromosomes apart the daughter chromosomes move to opposite ends of the cell in preparation for division nuclear envelopes reform around the separated daughter chromosomes during telophase the phragmoplast forms at the cells center the phragmoplast is the initial formation of the cell plate which will eventually form the new cell wall the chromosomes again become less distinct within the nuclear matrix as the cell cycle proceeds from mitosis to interphase cell division ends with cytokinesis which is the division of the cytoplasm by the completed new cell wall the result is the production of two new cells identical in genotype to the original cell growth by mitosis increases the vegetative size of the plant cells may undergo enlargement differentiation and development into different kinds of cells eg parenchyma collenchyma fibers and sclereids fig 10 parenchyma cells represent the basic living cell type it is a living cell with a primary cell wall that is metabolically active and capable of differentiating into specific cell types these may be for reserve storage as in endosperm cells or specialized for photosynthesis as the palisade and spongy mesophyll layers of the leaf they may also develop into cells that provide structural support for stems and leaves or protective layers for seeds these include collenchyma cells that are living cells with thickened primary cell walls collenchyma is usually found just below the epidermis in herbaceous and woody stems fibers and sclereids are examples of sclerenchyma cells that are nonliving at maturity these have thick secondary walls that provide strength and structural support eventually cells differentiate into tissues eg xylem phloem and organs such as stems roots leaves and fruit fig 11 cells capable of dividing are referred to as meristematic and are located in primary or apical meristems shoot and root tips and secondary growing points vascular cambium cork cambium leaf marginal meristems fig 12 meiosis the key feature of sexual reproduction is cell division through meiosis 64 meiosis takes place within mother cells microspore mother cells and megaspore mother cells of the flower to produce pollen male and the embryo sac female meiosis is the division of the nucleus that results in a reduction in the chromosome number by onehalf producing the haploid 1n condition eventually successful fertilization between haploid male and female gametes restores the diploid 2n zygote leading to seed formation meiosis fig 13 is separated into two parts meiosis i and ii each part of meiosis i and ii includes prophase metaphase anaphase and telophase stages meiosis differs from mitosis in several important aspects 1 mitosis results in two genetically identical diploid cells while meiosis results in four genetically different haploid cells 2 there is only one division cycle for mitosis while meiosis requires two division cycles just as in mitosis cells preparing for meiosis duplicate and double their chromosome number during interphase in preparation for division during prophase i the chromosomes become visible as centromeric chromatids and are arranged into homologous pairs then a remarkable process begins as the homologous chromosomes pairs exchange parts crossingover of individual chromatids attached pairs of chromosomes then separate during metaphase anaphase and telophase to generate two new cells to complete meiosis i in meiosis ii each pair of chromosomes separates at the centromere and produces two daughter cells four gametes each with a haploid n number and genetically different from the parent cell and from each other during sexual reproduction a haploid gamete from a pollen unites with the haploid gamete from the embryo sac to produce a diploid zygote the consequence of meiosis is the creation of new patterns of genetic variation three opportunities for variation exist a crossingover ie the interchange of genetic information during the early stages of meiosis i b the independent assortment of the chromosomes during the later stages of meiosis ii and c the recombination of haploid male and female gametes in the creation of new zygotes during fertilization,legal protection for plant cultivars developed through controlled breeding grants originators exclusive rights to propagate and distribute these varieties enabling monetary benefits in the us this began with the townsendpurnell act 1930 and was extended to seedpropagated varieties with the 1970 plant variety protection act revised in 1994 globally organizations like the international union for the protection of new varieties of plants upov have created guidelines for breeder rights the genetic foundation of plant propagation originates from a single cell or zygote formed by the union of male and female gametes this cell division process includes two types mitosis which supports growth by creating genetically identical cells and meiosis essential for sexual reproduction producing gametes with half the parent cells chromosomes meiosis introduces genetic variation via three mechanisms crossingover independent assortment and gamete recombination during fertilization specialized cells such as parenchyma for storage collenchyma for support and sclerenchyma for structure differentiate to form plant tissues like xylem and phloem
genetic inheritance because of the exchange of genetic material during crossingover the independent assortment of chromosomes during meiosis and the chance recombination during fertilization patterns of genetic variation may appear in seedling populations that can be expressed in mathematical ratios of individual traits see figs 14 and 15 these phenotypic distributions will be affected by whether the two genes are dominant or recessive and whether they are present as homozygous or heterozygous pairs many traits however are determined quantitatively by the interactions of a large number of genes that may be expressed uniquely in different environments fig 16 in nature seedling variability provides the opportunities for selection so that new genotypes can evolve that are adapted to specific environmental niches over time genotypes tend to become more or less stabilized or fixed when grown over a long period in the same environment this genotypeenvironment interaction is the basis for the origin of species 21 70 in cultivation seedling variation provides the opportunity for plant breeders to develop new kinds of plants that have special traits useful for humans but whose genotype must be maintained by special techniques of seed production in general plant breeding includes transferring genes from desirable parents to their offspring by crossing and then stabilizing fixing the genotype of the offspring population for propagation 1 12 37 71 gene structure and activity genes play a dual role in all organisms 6 49 64 first they provide the physical mechanism by which individual traits and characteristics are reproduced from generation to generation both by seed meiosis or vegetative propagation mitosis second genes contain the specific directions for regulating the chain of morphological and physiological events that determine the expression of specific traits and characteristics of the phenotype the central dogma of this process is that genetic information flows with some exceptions from deoxyribonucleic acid dna to ribonucleic acid rna to proteins through processes of transcription and translation genes as structural units of inheritance premendel the concepts and practices of plant and animal selection has a long and progressive history prior to 1900 plant breeders and plant propagators often the same individual carried on selection by visual inspection of specific traits and characteristics that is in seed propagation the phenotypes of parents were compared with their seedling offspring in vegetative propagation the clonal source plant was compared with its vegetative progeny improvement was through mass selection in which the best phenotypes of one generation were chosen as parents for the next mendelian genetics the rediscovery in 1900 of gregor mendels 56 paper published in 1866 marked the start of a new era in which selection became based on experimentally determined hereditary principles under the term mendelian genetics the concept of gene emerged as well as the term genotype chromosomes which had been discovered about 50 years earlier were found to be related to patterns of gene inheritance 20 chromosomes were found to be composed of dna and proteins a basic question was whether proteins or dna were responsible for inheritance the answer obtained from studies with specific bacterial viruses called bacteriophages 39 showed that dna was responsible for inheritance dnabased genetics the studies of watson and crick published in 1953 on the structure of the dna molecule 81 not only provided the biochemical model for dna duplication during mitosis and meiosis but ushered in a new era of genetic research fig 17 subsequent studies identified the genetic code used to translate genetic information into functional proteins this universal code was first identified in bacteria and then confirmed as a universal code for all organisms this identification of genetic code was accompanied by the elucidation of gene regulation through the processes of transcription and translation which regulate the expression of individual genes the structure of a chromosome consists of two strands of dna in combination with various structural proteins called histones the essential components of the dna structure are nucleotides which are combinations of one of four possible chemical nitrogenous bases thymine adenine guanine cytosine a fivecarbon sugar molecule deoxyribose and phosphate po4 fig 17 nucleotides are attached to long chemical strands made up of phosphate po4 radicals that connect the 5 fiveprime position of one sugar molecule to the 3 threeprime position on the next sugar molecule a base is attached at one end to a sugar molecule and loosely attracted by a hydrogen bond to a different but complementary base on the other dna strand guanine g pairs with cytosine c and adenine a with thymine t the result is a doublehelix structure of long double chains of repeating nucleotides this structure gives dna a unique capacity to replicate itself during mitosis and meiosis when catalyzed by the enzyme dna polymerase the specific sequence of nucleotide bases ie base pairs provides the genetic information that determines inheritance establishes the specific genotype of the organism and directs the pattern of gene expression a coding unit consists of a specific sequence of three of the four bases and is known as a codon codons translate into one of twenty amino acids used to make proteins from a molecular standpoint a gene can be described as a linear piece of dna 65 which includes the following a coding regions known as exons that contain the genetic instructions b noncoding regions known as introns c an initiation codon also known as a promoter d a termination codon and e a regulator sequence adjoining the gene on the 5 end that determines when a gene is turned on and off fig 18 6 64 gene expression transcription genetic information is copied from one of the strands of dna onto similar macromolecules called rna ribonucleic acid the structure of rna differs from nuclear plant dna in that it has only a single strand a different sugar ribose and includes uracil instead of thymine rna exists in several forms at the transcription stage it is called messenger rna or mrna the process begins with a signal recognition process that involves various environmental physiological or hormonal cues to turn on the gene this is followed by the initiation of transcription of specific dna sequences to make singlestranded mrna molecules a specific enzyme rna polymerase mediates transcription that results in the synthesis of mrna moleculeswhich may vary from 200 to 10000 nucleotides in size these move from the nucleus across the nuclear membrane into the cytoplasm fig 19 translation translation is the process of building a protein based on the genetic code sequenced on the mrna translation is a coordinated effort among mrna ribosomes transfer rna trna and amino acids proteins are made at the ribosome where the mrna passes between the two ribosome subunits transfer rna brings the appropriate amino acid to the ribosomal complex for translation into the protein called for by the codon on the mrna amino acids become linked together in chains first as peptides then polypeptides and eventually specific proteins proteins expressed after translation can be visualized using gel electrophoresis fig 20 regulating gene expression proteins are large complex macromolecules many of which function as enzymes that regulate the biochemical reactions controlling metabolic and developmental plant processes the types and functionality of proteins produced by the cell determines plant growth and development therefore regulation of gene transcription is an important component of determining a cells developmental fate regulation of gene transcription involves effector and repressor molecule interactions at the regulatory sequences found at the threeprime portion of the gene called the promoter region this type of gene regulation can be illustrated by the repressorderepressor model for auxin action fig 21 83 the auxin responsive gene has a sequence in the promoter region called the auxin response element auxre the promoter protein called auxin response factor arf physically interacts with this regulatory element to promote gene expression however when auxin is not present the repressor molecule auxiaa interacts with arf in such a way that it is unable to promote transcription when auxin is present in the cell auxin binds to its receptor moleculre tir1 to initiate degradation of the auxiaa repressor this releases arf from its repression by auxiaa to promote gene transcription this type of repressorderepressor interaction seems to be a common mechanism controlling gene expression gene expression can also be regulated after transcription is complete and mrna is made one example of this control is by small nontranslating rna molecules such as micrornas micrornas function in translational repression and are important for controlling development in plants and animals they are small 22 nucleotide rnas that are components of a rnainduced silencing complex micrornas seek out complementary mrna bind to them and target them for enzymatic degradation using auxininduced gene expression again as an example several micrornas that are developmental regulated target arf mrna for silencing these micrornas prevent arf mrna translation which in turn eliminates arf as a promoter of auxinresponsive genes posttranslational control is also an important regulatory mechanism for growth and development proteins made through the gene expression pathway may not have regulatory function until they are modified a common protein modification is through phosphoroylation by kinase enzymes this sets up kinase cascades that are important consequenses of hormonereceptor binding and downstream hormone activity biotechnology a long sequence of basic laboratory studies has led to a revolution in genetic research which is described under the umbrella term of biotechnology these have begun to have farreaching applications not only in propagation but across the whole range of applied biology cell and tissue culture technology this term refers to an array of concepts and procedures involving the propagation and culture of cells tissues and individual plant organs in aseptic closed systems among the culture systems developed are those for embryos ovules shoot apices callus protoplasts and cell suspensions these concepts and procedures are powerful tools that have revolutionized many aspects of plant physiology genetics and propagation some procedures are used commercially in nursery operations others are primarily for genetic improvement and others are for scientific investigations dnabased marker technology this category refers to the group of laboratory procedures that utilize the nucleotide sequences present on small dna fragments produced artificially from chromosomes by specific enzyme treatments to identify and label specific locations in the genome with appropriate procedures the sequences on these segments can be used as dna markers which are visually observed as bands on an electrophoresis plate fig 22 this technique makes it possible to identify specific genes and eventually to characterize whole genomes nucleotide sequencing techniques are used to monitor and predict variation during breeding operations markerassisted gene linkage maps and to identify specific cultivars dna fingerprinting 7 78 84 they also provide data to investigate botanical and evolutionary relation ships by creating cladograms that show genetic similarities among members of a genus or plant family 23 27 63 recombinant dna technology this term includes a group of procedures in which the nucleotide sequences of the dna molecule representing a gene can be isolated cloned and hybridized with other dna fragments to produce what is known as recombinant dna these hybrid dna clones can be used as genetic probes to identify and characterize gene expression also by using appropriate methods dna from a donor organism can be introduced into cells of another organism to become part of its genome 19 30 44 plants transformed using recombinant dna techniques are called transgenic and are popularly known as genetically modified organisms gmos examples of economic traits being engineered include various seed components 13 flower longevity 31 and disease 53 and insect resistance 74,genetic inheritance involves the transfer of genetic material through crossingover and independent assortment during meiosis leading to variations that follow predictable ratios traits may be dominant or recessive and expression depends on gene pairs being homozygous or heterozygous some characteristics result from multiple genes influenced by environmental interactions supporting evolution and adaptation genes composed of dna sequences determine both inherited traits and cellular functions by encoding proteins genetic information flows from dna to rna to proteins through transcription and translation regulation of gene expression involves transcription factors micrornas and posttranslational modifications like phosphorylation biotechnology advances such as cell and tissue culture dna markers and recombinant dna allow precise genetic analysis and improvement dna markers help identify specific genes while recombinant dna technology enables creation of genetically modified organisms gmos with desirable traits such as disease resistance micrornas control protein production and recombinant dna techniques are used to develop crops with beneficial traits
plant hormones and plant development plant hormones phytohormones are naturally occurring organic chemicals of relatively low molecular weight active in small concentrations the classic definition of a hormone is that they are synthesized at a given site and translocated to their site of action however there are some exceptions for plant hormones they are specific molecules involved in the induction and regulation of growth and development the five major plant hormones are auxin cytokinin gibberellin abscisic acid and ethylene additional compounds considered hormones include brassinosteroids jasmonates salicylic acid polyamines and peptide hormones plant hormones have great importance in propagation because they not only are part of the internal mechanism that regulates plant function but they also can induce specific responses such as root initiation in cuttings and dormancy release in seeds in addition to these substances certain chemicals some natural others syntheticshow hormonal effects to plants both natural and synthetic types are classed together as plant growth regulators pgrs table 3 lists the characteristics of important pgrs used in propagation their usage will be further described in subsequent chapters here is a usual set of events that occurs during hormoneinduced growth and development 1 biosynthesis of the hormone 2 transport or distribution to its site of action 3 perception of the hormone signal by its cellular receptor 4 signal transduction leading to downstream events often at the molecular gene expression level it has become evident that many types of growth and development are not controlled by a single hormone rather there is considerable interaction and crosstalk often between several hormones often there is one principle hormone controlling development with other hormones modifying its action 45 for example abscisic acids control over seed dormancy is modulated by gibberellin cytokinin ethylene and brassinosteroid some of the plant hormones are present in active and conjugated forms conjugation is the addition of a sugar or amino acid to the chemical structure of the hormone conjugation may inactivate the hormone permanently or enzymes can interconvert the hormone between conjugated and free forms through a process called homeostatic control auxins auxin was the first plant hormone discovered by plant scientists phototropism where unidirectional light altered the growth of plant coleoptiles in grass seedlings was one of the first biological systems studied by botanists including charles darwin 22 fritz went kenneth thimann 82 and a number of other researchers showed that these effects could be induced by plant extracts which were subsequently shown to contain the chemical indole3acetic acid iaa there are two biosynthetic pathways for iaa in plants 5 primary auxin biosynthesis is via the amino acid ltryptophan but iaa can also be synthesized by a tryptophanindependent pathway most of the iaa in plant tissue is in the conjugated form using both amino acids and sugars for conjugation free active iaa comprises approximately 1 percent of the total auxin content with the remaining portion in the conjugated form primary sites of auxin biosynthesis include root and shoot meristems young leaf primordia vascular tissue and reproductive organs including developing seeds fig 25 auxin movement from cell to cell requires efflux carriers located on the plant membrane fig 26 83 they control polar auxin movement from plant tips distal ends to their base proximal end cellular auxin movement and the subsequent polar gradient established between cells is important for normal development of the plant embryo as well as the shoot apical meristem 57 auxin has a major role for controlling phototrophism inhibition of lateral buds by terminal buds apical dominance formation of abscission layer on leaves and fruit activation of cambial growth and adventitious root initiation auxin is the most widely used hormone in plant propagation because of its impact on adventitious rooting in cuttings and its control of morphogenesis during micropropagation iaa degrades in the light and exogenously applied iaa is quickly degraded by the enzyme iaaoxidase synthetic auxins are less susceptible to iaaoxidase degradation and are therefore used more often for commercial applications the most useful synthetic auxins discovered about 1935 are indole3butyric acid iba and 1naphthalene acetic acid naa iba has been subsequently found to occur naturally but in less abundance compared to iaa iba must be converted by plant tissue into iaa to function the herbicide 24d 24dichlorophenoxyacetic acid has auxin activity and is an important inducer of somatic embryogenesis in tissue culture various synthetic iba conjugates such as its aryl ester pitbfig 25 have been developed with good auxin activity but are not widely available or used 35 auxins are not readily dissolved in water and must be dissolved in a solvent ethanol dmso or a base 1n naoh before being quickly added to water potassium salts of iba and naa kiba knaa are auxin formulations that easily dissolve in water and are available commercially cytokinins cytokinins were discovered by miller and skoog at the university of wisconsin in efforts to develop methods for growing plant cells in tissue culture 68 through the 1940s and 1950s researchers were frustrated because isolated plant cells and tissues grew poorly or not at all in tissue culture at that time tissue culture media supplemented with coconut milk liquid endosperm had the most stimulating effect on cell division compared to other compounds evaluated then miller and skoog inadvertently discovered that an extract from autoclaved fish sperm dna yielded a compound that greatly stimulated cell division this synthetic compound was called kinetin and the hormone class was called cytokinins because of their ability to stimulate cell division subsequently the naturally occurring cytokinins zeatin isolated from corn endosperm and isopentenyladenine 2ip were found in seeds and other plant parts these previously mentioned cytokinins along with the naturally occurring dihydrozeatin and the synthetic benzyladenine ba or bap represent the aminopurine type cytokinins fig 27 another class of compoundsthe dipheylureasdisplays potent cytokinin activity but are structurally dissimilar to natural occurring cytokinins including thiourea diphenylurea thidizuron tdz and n2chloro4pyridyl n phenylurea cppu the major route for cytokinin biosynthesis is via the isoprenoid pathway with isopenteyltransferase ipt being the key regulatory enzyme 48 the root tip is a primary source of cytokinin but biosynthesis also occurs in seeds embryos and developing leaves in addition to free forms of cytokinin conjugated derivatives include ribosides ribotides aminoacids and sugarsmany of which freely interconvert the major enzyme for cytokinin destruction is cytokininoxidase cytokinins are thought to play a regulatory role in cell division shoot initiation and development senescence photomorphogenesis and apical dominance cytokinins play a key role in regulating various aspects of the cell cycle and mitosis transgenic plants overexpressing the ipt gene show elevated cytokinin levels reduced height increased lateral branching and reduced chlorophyll destruction leading to a deep green color tissue infected with agrobacterium tumifaciens grow and proliferate in tissue culture independent of growth regulator application this is because it induces elevated cytokinin levels by inserting an ipt gene from its plasmid into the plants genome the interaction of auxin and cytokinin is one of the primary hormonal relationships in plant growth and development as well as plant propagation a high auxincytokinin ratio favors rooting a high cytokininauxin ratio favors shoot formation and a high level of both favors callus development gibberellins gibberellins 69 were discovered before world war ii by japanese scientists trying to explain the abnormally tall growth and reduced yield of rice infected by the fungi gibberella fukikuori perfect stage or fusarium moniliformne imperfect stage an active ingredient was extracted from the fungus and its chemical structure was determined as gibberellins named after the fungus subsequently gibberellins were found to be naturally occurring hormones in plants all gibberellins are cyclic diterpenoids and named for their structure not their activity more than 100 forms of gibberellins have been found in plants but only a few are physiologically active the most important naturally occurring active gibberellins include ga1 ga4 ga7 fig 28 depending on the plant they will tend to make either ga1 or ga4 as their primary gibberellin gibberellic acid ga3 is the gibberellin found in fungi and is the most important commercial product biosynthesis of gibberellins 73 76 starts with mevalonate an important precursor for many secondary compounds in plants and proceeds via the iosprenoid pathway its biosynthesis is a coordinated process involving the plastids endoplasmic reticulum and cytosol numerous enzymes are regulated during gibberellin biosynthesis but ga20 oxidase appears to especially important active gibberellins are inactivated by ga2 oxidase gibberellins can also be sugar conjugated as previous discussed with other hormones gibberellins are made in developing seeds and fruits elongating shoots and roots gibberellins are the primary hormone controlling plant height gibberellin mutants impaired for gibberellin biosynthesis are dwarfed compared to wild type plants demonstrating the importance of gibberellins for shoot elongation several commercially available gibberellin biosynthesis inhibitors including ancymidol cycocel paclobutrazol bonzi and uniconizole sumagic are important plant growth regulators used to control plant height during greenhouse pot and bedding plant production gibberellins also play a role in plant maturation and in triggering flowering gibberellins are particularly important during seed germination where the antagonistic interactions between gibberellin and abscisic acid are involved in dormancy release and germination abscisic acid aba abscisic acid was originally discovered during the 1960s in studies searching for hormonal control of leaf abscission and bud dormancy fig 29 these studies suggested that aba was involved in abscission and the isolated compound was called abscisin ii studies also suggested that aba was involved in bud dormancy and that compound was called dormin however subsequent analyses determined that aba was not a major factor in leaf abscission 2 but may be involved in bud dormancy abas major role in plant growth and development is to modulate environmental stresses especially water stress aba regulates stomatal opening and closure as an indicator of plant water status and promotes root growth under water stress abas other major roles are as a major determinant of zygotic embryo growth during seed development and in maintaining seed dormancy aba mutants typically show reduced seed dormancy increased precocious germination and wilted leaves at the whole plant level aba is a sesquiterpene synthesized directly from carotenoids carotene and zeaxanthin rather than the usual mevalonate pathway observed for gibberellins biosynthesis occurs in coordination between enzymes in the plastids and cytosol 67 the aba molecule has two isomeric forms cis and trans the trans form is the more active and common form in plants the chemical structure also has a and form that cannot be interconverted the form is active and occurs in nature commercial products are mixtures of both and forms fluridone is a carotenoid biosynthesis inhibitor that chemically reduces aba levels in plants cellular aba concentrations are important for controlling aba action important regulated enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway appear to be 9cisepoxycarotenoid dioxygenase nced and xeaxanthin epoxidase zep for increased aba levels while cytochrome p450 707a cyp707a is the major enzyme reducing aba levels 28 ethylene dimitry neljubow a russian scientist is credited with the first report of the effects of ethylene on plants in 1901 66 he demonstrated that ethylene was the agent from illuminating gas used in street lamps that caused plant damage he also used etiolated pea seedlings to study the effects of ethylene on plant growth and identified the triple response in ethylenetreated seedlings seedlings displaying the triple respone show inhibition of stem elongation increased radial swelling in the hypocotyl and horizontal stem orientation to gravity ethylene is a gas with a very simple hydrocarbon structure fig 30 however it can have profound effects on plant growth including epinasty at high concentrations senescence and abscission in leaves and fruit flowering apical dominance latex production and flower induction in propagation ethylene can induce adventitious roots stimulate germination and overcome dormancy wounding stress and auxin usually stimulate increased ethylene production naturally occurring ethylene is involved in the maturity of certain fruits and is widely used to induce ripening in commercial storage ethephon 2chloroethylphosphoric acid is absorbed by plant tissue where it breaks down to ethylene it is used on some crops to promote ripening to act as a thinning agent to promote or reduce flowering and to reduce apical dominance ethylene gas is a natural byproduct of combustible fuels and escaping fumes can cause damage in commercial storage and greenhouse production likewise ethylene from ripening fruit causes damage to other plant material in common storage ethylene is synthesized from the amino acid methionine via a pathway that includes sadenosylmethionine and laminocyclopropanelcarboxylic acid acc as precursors key regulated enzymes in the pathway include accsynthase and accoxidase ethylene inhibitors are used commercially to inhibit flower senescence and delay fruit ripening aminoethoxyvinylglycine avg retain inhibits ethylene biosynthesis while silver thiosulfate silver nitrate and 1methylcyclopropene mcp inhibit ethylene action by altering ethylenes ability to bind to its receptor,plant hormones or phytohormones are vital signaling molecules that regulate plant growth development and responses to environmental conditions the primary hormones include auxin cytokinin gibberellin abscisic acid aba and ethylene each influencing specific physiological processes auxin controls root initiation phototropism growth towards light and apical dominance enabling plants to direct growth efficiently cytokinin promotes cell division and shoot development balancing growth between roots and shoots gibberellins are essential for stem elongation seed germination and flowering playing a key role in developmental transitions aba is known as the stress hormone helping plants cope with drought by managing stomatal closure to conserve water ethylene regulates responses to mechanical stress and plays a crucial role in fruit ripening and leaf abscission hormone crosstalk allows plants to adapt to complex environments as interactions among hormones can amplify or mitigate each others effects hormones can also undergo conjugation where they bind to other molecules like sugars or amino acids allowing temporary inactivation or storage synthetic plant growth regulators pgrs are widely used in agriculture to control growth patterns improve crop yield and manage dormancy showcasing the importance of these hormones in plant adaptation and productivity
additional plant hormones certain other naturally occurring substances are considered by some to show hormonal action these include brassinosteroids jasmonates salicylic acid polyamines and peptide hormones brassinosteroids brassinosteroids were originally extracted from brassica napus pollen and called brassins 15 they were shown to have growthregulator activity in seedling bioassays and the active components were identified as brassinolide brassinosteroids importance as a new plant hormone on plant growth was demonstrated when brassinosteroiddeficient mutants were discovered in arabidopsis that showed extreme dwarf plant growth that was recovered to wild type growth with exogenous brassinosteroid application brassinosteroids are a class of plant steroid hormones that include over forty members including brassinolide fig 31 biosynthesis of brassinosteroids is from plant sterols cycloartenol campestrol derived from the mevalonate pathway brassinosteroiddeficient mutants show reduced shoot growth reduced fertility and vascular development brassinosteroids complement auxin and cytokinin for cell division gibberellin for seed germination and are involved in phytochromemediated photomorphogenesis jasmonates jasmonic acid and methyl jasmonate are collectively called jasomnates and are members of the oxylipins derived from the oxidation of fatty acids starting with membrane linolenic acid fig 33 11 18 the name jasmonate is in reference to its first discovery as a component in jasminum grandiflora oil in the 1980s jasmonate was found to naturally occur as a germination inhibitor in bean seeds and was thought to have similar properties to aba however their primary roles are in plant defense abiotic stress and plant developmental process like wounding and senescence jasmonate levels increase with wounding and are important for inducing systemic wound responses and exogenous jasmonate accelerates senescence they interact with salicylic acid and ethylene as part of regulatory systems involved in plant defense methyljasmonate is a volatile compound thought to move within and between plants as a form of communication that can induce defense genes and compounds in plants prior to being exposed to the invading organism salicylic acid salicylic acid is a plant phenolic compound derived from the shikimic acid pathway its name comes from its discovery in willow salix bark fig 32 it is a precursor to aspirin acetylsalicylic acid salicylic acid has a major role in plant defense and is a critical component in systemic acquired resistance against pathogen attack 36 salicylic acid may also be involved in plant growth via photosynthesis flowering and mineral nutrition one interesting role for salicylic acid is as part of the heatgenerating system found in themogenic aroid and cycad plants application of salicylic acid to voodoo lily led to temperature increases of as much as 12c as previously indicated salicylic acid interacts with jasmonates and ethylene for plant defense polyamines polyamines putrescine cadaverine spermidine and spermine are synthesized from the amino acids arginine and ornithine and are widespread in animals and plants 3 polyamines are required for cell growth and can function to stabilize dna in 1678 antoni van leeuwenhoek using the recently invented microscope found stellate crystals in human semen which were later identified and named spermine key enzymes in the pathway include ornithine decarboxylase arginine decarboyxlase spermine synthase and spermidine synthase inhibitors are available for each of these enzymes spermine and spermidine synthase share sadenosylmethionine as a precursor with the ethylene biosynthetic pathway competition for this precursor has been shown to be important for a number of plant processes including seed germination senescence fruit ripening and adventitious root formation additional processes where polyamines appear important or essential include seed development somatic embryogenesis flower initiation and plant stress inclusion of polyamines in tissue culture systems has enhanced both of these processes flower initiation in thin layer culture systems of tobacco have been directly related to polyamines plant peptide and polypeptide hormones peptide hormones have an established role in animal physiology but it has only been recently that small peptide molecules have been discovered that influence plant growth in development 54 systemin was the first peptide hormone discovered as an 18amino acid peptide involved in longdistance communication in response to insect attack other peptide hormones include scrsp11 involved in pollenstigma selfincompatibility enod40 involved in rhizobiuminduced nodule formation in legumes ida involved in flower petal abscission and phytosulfokines involved in cell proliferation during carrot tissue culture florigen the longsoughtafter factor promoting plant flowering may be a polypeptide transcription factor called the ft flowering locus t protein 16 75 plant development competency and determinism one of the principles in biology is that each living plant cell has the potential to reproduce an entire organism since it possesses all of the necessary genetic information in its genes to reproduce all the characteristics of the plant this concept is known as totipotency 32 the basic concepts of competency and determination for plant organ formation were developed from a series of experiments inducing shoot and root regeneration in field bindweed convolvulus arvensis leaf explants 14 competency was described as the potential of a cells or tissue to develop in a particular direction for example the initiation of adventitious roots on a stem cutting or the change from a vegetative to a flowering meristem 55 58 60 at some point of development the process becomes irreversible and the cells are said to be determined therefore determination describes the degree to which cells are committed toward a specific organ formation a general scheme for adventitious organ formation is shown in figure 34 development of competency into a particular kind of cell tissue or organ also may require a special signal these may originate internally within the plant or externally as an environment signal for example the internal change in type of growing point such as vegetative to flowering may be associated with a shift in the activity of specific hormones external parameters including the application of specific growth regulators or the subjection of the plant to various environments may bring about changes the signal may be applied exogenously such as hormone application for the induction of adventitious roots buds shoots or somatic embryos these events take place if specific cells retain the potential for regeneration during development in addition specific cells can be induced to dedifferentiate and develop the capacity to regenerate this potential to regenerate is the basis of propagation by cuttings layering specialized stems and roots and tissue culture,additional plant hormones like brassinosteroids jasmonates salicylic acid polyamines and peptide hormones play crucial roles in plant growth defense and development brassinosteroids derived from plant sterols regulate growth and help mutants recover normal growth patterns jasmonates including jasmonic acid are oxylipins that activate plant defense especially after wounding and interact with salicylic acid salicylic acid derived from the shikimic acid pathway is key to systemic acquired resistance against pathogens and also aids in photosynthesis and temperature regulation polyamines synthesized from amino acids are critical for cell growth dna stabilization and processes like seed germination and flower initiation peptide hormones though new in plant science affect growth defense and flowering as seen in systemin which mediates insect defense key concepts like totipotency the cells ability to form an entire organism and competency and determination which guide cell development and commitment are fundamental for regeneration and growth in plants
the propagation environment introduction propagation can be done in the field orchard forest outdoor raised beds and in protected culture environments such as greenhouses polycovered houses and tissue culture laboratories the plant propagation period is generally a very narrow segment of a plants life ranging from several weeks for fastgrowing herbaceous plants to one to two years for woody perennials following propagation the rooted cuttings seedlings plugs layers or tissue culture produced plants are transplanted as liner plants the liner plants are grown in small pots and then transplanted into larger containers or directly transplanted into field production in other production systems plants may be propagated and produced in the same container or field location without going through a liner stage to enhance the propagation of plants commercial producers manipulate the environment of propagules cuttings seeds by managing a microclimatic conditions light waterrelative humidity temperature and gases b edaphic factors propagation medium or soil mineral nutrition and water and c biotic factorsinteraction of propagules with other organisms such as beneficial bacteria mycorrhizal fungi pathogens insect pests etc fig 1 unique ecological conditions exist during propagation commercial propagators may have to compromise to obtain an average environment in which a whole range of species are propagated by cuttings seed andor tissue culture explants 69 the environmental conditions that are optimum for plant propagation are frequently conducive for pests pathogenic fungi viruses bacteria insect and mite development astute propagators not only manage the environment during propagation but also manipulate the environment of stock plants prior to selecting propagules such as shading and stooling to maximize rooting potential of a propagule and post propagationhardeningoff weaning rooted cuttings from the mist system and changing fertility regimes to assure growth and survival of tenderrooted liner plants after propagation environmental factors affecting propagation in propagating and growing young nursery plants facilities and procedures are designed to optimize the response of plants to environmental factors influencing their growth and development such as light water temperature gases and mineral nutrition in addition young nursery plants require protection from pathogens and other pests as well as control of salinity levels in the growing media the propagation structures equipment and procedures described in this chapter if handled properly maximize the plants growth and development by controlling their environment light light is important for photosynthesis as a source of radiant energy light also generates a heat load that needs to be controlled ie too high a temperature can quickly desiccate and kill cuttings the management of light can be critical for rooting cuttings germinating seeds growing seedlings or shoot multiplication of explants during tissue culture propagation light can be manipulated by controlling irradiance see box 2 light duration daylength photoperiod and light quality wavelength for a relative comparison of light units for propagation see box 3 irradiance while many propagators still measure light intensity determining the photon flux of light is more accurate because the process of photosynthesis depends on the number of photons intercepted photosynthetic photon flux not just the light given off by a point source intensity daylength photoperiod higher plants are classified as longday shortday or dayneutral based on the effect of photoperiod on initiation of reproductive growth longday plants which flower chiefly in the summer will flower when the critical photoperiod of light is equaled or exceeded shortday plants such as chrysanthemums flower when the critical photoperiod is not exceeded reproductive growth in dayneutral plants such as roses is not triggered by photoperiod the discovery of photoperiodism by garner and allard demonstrated that the dark period not the light period is most critical to initiation of reproductive growth even though light cycles are traditionally used to denote a plants photoperiod in propagation fresh seed collected in the fall from selected woody plant species such as larix need longday conditions to germinate dahlia cuttings need shortday conditions to trigger tuberous root formation photoperiod can be extended under shortday conditions of late fall and early winter by lighting with incandescent lights or high intensity discharge lights hid fig 14 conversely photoperiod can be shortened under the longday conditions of late spring and summer by covering stock plants and cuttings with black cloth or plastic that eliminates all light light quality light quality is perceived by the human eye as color and corresponds to a specific range of wavelengths red light is known to enhance seed germination of selected lettuce cultivars while farred light inhibits germination farred light can promote bulb formation on longday plants such as onion allium cepa blue light enhances in vitro bud regeneration of tomato 77 using greenhouse covering materials with different spectral lighttransmitting characteristics researchers at clemson university 97 have been able to control the height and development of greenhousegrown plants rather than relying on the chemical application of growth regulators for height control this has application for plant propagation liner production and plant tissue culture systems red shade cloth shifts light quality towards the bluegreen and is being used to enhance root development of cuttings fig 11 red shade cloth can also be used to increase leaf surface and branching which is important in liner development 111 waterhumidity control water management and humidity control are critical in propagation water management is one of the most effective tools for regulating plant growth evaporative cooling of an intermittent mist system can help control the propagation house microenvironment and reduce the heat load on cuttings thereby permitting utilization of high light conditions to increase photosynthesis and encourage subsequent root development a solid support medium such as peatperlite is not always necessary to propagate plants peach cuttings can be rooted under aeroponic systems while woody and herbaceous ornamentals can be rooted in modified aerohydroponic systems without relying on overhead mist 108 tissue culture explants are often grown in a liquid phase rather than on a solid agar media while leaf water potential leaf is an important parameter for measuring water status of seedlings and cuttings and influences rooting of cuttings turgor p is physiologically more important for growth processes the water status of seedlings and cuttings is a balance between transpirational losses and uptake of water later in this chapter the methods to control water loss of leaves of cuttings seedlings and containerized grafted plants are discussed temperature temperature affects plant propagation in many ways seed dormancy is broken in some woody species by coolmoist stratification conditions that allow the germination process to proceed temperature of the propagation medium can be suboptimal for seed germination or rooting due to seasonally related ambient air temperature or the cooling effect of mist in grafting heating devices are sometimes placed in the graft union area to speed up graft union formation while the rest of the rootstock is kept dormant under cooler conditions it is often more satisfactory and costeffective to manipulate temperature by bottom heating at the propagation bench level rather than heating the entire propagation house fig 2 the use of heating and cooling systems in propagation structures is discussed further in this chapter gases and gas exchange high respiration rates occur with seed germination and plug development and during adventitious root formation at the base of a cutting these aerobic processes require that o2 be consumed and co2 be given off by the propagule seed germination is impeded when a hard seed coat restricts gas exchange likewise gas exchange at the site of root initiation and subsequent rooting are reduced when cuttings are stuck in highly watersaturated propagation media with small air pore spaces in leaves of droughted propagules stomata are closed gas exchange is limited and suboptimal rates of photosynthesis occur during propagation in enclosed greenhouses ambient co2 levels can drop to suboptimal levels limiting photosynthesis and propagule development the buildup of ethylene gas c2h4 can be deleterious to propagules during storage shipping and propagation conditions ethylene also plays a role in plant respiration rooting of cuttings and seed propagation mineral nutrition to avoid stress and poor development during propagation it is important that the stock plants be maintained under optimal nutritionprior to harvesting propagules during propagation nutrients are generally applied to seedlings and plugs by fertigation soluble fertilizers added to irrigation water or with controlledrelease fertilizers that are either preincorporated into the propagation medium or broadcast topdressed across the medium surface cuttings are normally fertilized with a controlledrelease fertilizer preincorporated into the propagation medium which is discussed later in this chapter or with soluble fertilizer applied after roots are initiated the development of intermittent mist revolutionized propagation but the mist can severely leach cuttings of nutrients this is a particular problem with cuttings of difficulttoroot species that have long propagation periods,plant propagation the process of producing new plants from seeds cuttings or tissue culture is conducted in environments like fields greenhouses and laboratories for optimal growth propagators carefully manage environmental factors that impact young plants known as propagules microclimatic factorslight water temperature and gasesare critical light essential for photosynthesis is managed by adjusting intensity day length photoperiod and quality wavelength to support rooting and growth for example red light enhances root development while blue light promotes shoot growth humidity and water are controlled with misting systems to maintain plant hydration and prevent overheating temperature control is vital for processes like seed germination and targeted heating eg bottom heating is used to save energy edaphic factors including soil and nutrient management ensure mineral nutrition for the propagules fertigation nutrients in irrigation or controlledrelease fertilizers are commonly used to maintain adequate nutrient levels gas exchange mainly oxygen and carbon dioxide supports respiration and photosynthesis poor gas exchange can impede root growth additionally biotic factors like beneficial microbes are managed to enhance health and disease resistance together these techniques create optimal conditions for plant growth resilience and survival
physical structures for managing the propagation environment propagation structures facilities required for propagating plants by seed cuttings and grafting and other methods include two basic units one is a structure with temperature control and ample light such as a greenhouse modified quonset house or hotbedwhere seeds can be germinated or cuttings rooted or tissue culture microplants rooted and acclimatized the second unit is a structure into which the young tender plants liners can be moved for hardening which is preparatory to transplanting outdoors cold frames low polyethylene tunnels or sun tunnels covered by saran and lathhouses are useful for this purpose any of these structures may at certain times of the year and for certain species serve as a propagation and acclimation structure a synopsis of how structures are utilized in propagation is presented in table 1 greenhouses greenhouses have a long history of use by horticulturists as a means of forcing more rapid growth of plants 11 41 55 75 122 most of the greenhouse area in the united states is used for the wholesale propagation and production of floricultural crops such as pot plants foliage plants bedding plants and cut flowers fewer are used for nursery stock and vegetable crops 104 greenhouse structures vary from elementary homeconstructed to elaborate commercial installations commercial greenhouses are usually independent structures of evenspan gableroof construction proportioned so that the space is well utilized for convenient walkways and propagating benches 55 in larger propagation operations several single greenhouse units are often attached side by side eliminating the cost of covering the adjoining walls with glass or polyethylene fig 3 these gutterconnected houses while more expensive to construct than independent groundtoground structures allow easy access between houses and decrease the square footage meters of land needed for propagation houses heating and cooling equipment is more economical to install and operate since a large growing area can share the same equipment 62 greenhouses with doubletiered moveable benches that can be rolled outside and retractable roof greenhouses reduce energy costs figs 4 and 5 they are being used in cutting and seed propagation and seedling plug production since the liner seedlings are partly produced under full sun conditions they are better acclimatized for the consumer 8 quonsettype construction is very popular such houses are inexpensive to build usually consisting of a framework of piping and are easily covered with one or two layers of polyethylene fig 6 arrangement of benches in greenhouses varies considerably some propagation installations do not have permanently attached benches their placement varying according to the type of equipment such as lift trucks or electric carts used to move flats and plants the correct bench system can increase production efficiency and reduce labor costs 124 rolling benches can reduce aisle space and increase the usable space by 30 percent in a propagation greenhouse the benches are pushed together until one needs to get between them and then rolled apart fig 4 with rolling benches propagation work can be done in an ergonomically correct fashion making workers more comfortable efficient and productive 118 besides increased propagation production numbers rolling benches allow other automation features to be added fig 7 conversely to reduce costs many propagation houses are designed not to use benches but rather cutting flats or small liner containers are placed on the gravel or sarancovered floor figs 6 and 7 it all depends on the propagation system and units to be produced in an floor ebb and flood system flood floor greenhouse benches are eliminated and plants are produced with an automated floor watering and fertility system there are belowground floorheating pipes and irrigation lines a system of runoffcapturing tanks with filters and computercontrolled return of appropriate levels of irrigation water mixed with soluble fertilizer to the floor growing area 9 89 while this has received limited use in the propagation of plants it does have application for liner stock plant production of seedling plugs rooted cuttings and tissue culture produced plantlets fig 8 flood floor systems are more efficient than conventional bench greenhouses they are highly automated require less labor and are environmentally friendlysince irrigation runoff including nutrients and pesticides is recaptured and recycled the drawback of these benchless systems is the potential for rapid disease spread greenhouse construction begins with a metal framework covered with polycarbonate acrylic glass or poly plastic material gutterconnected greenhouses can be constructed as bowstyle houses which are less expensive and offer less structural strength or as loadbearing trussstyle houses which give propagators the ability to hang mist and irrigation booms install ceiling curtains for temperature and light control and so on fig 3 allmetal prefabricated greenhouses with prewelded or prebolted trusses are also widely used and are available from several manufacturers in any type of greenhouse or bench construction using wood the wood should be pressuretreated with a preservative such as chromatid copper arsenate cca which will add many years to its life 5 the two most common structural materials for greenhouses are steel and aluminum most greenhouses are made from galvanized steel which is cheaper stronger lighter and smaller than an aluminum member of equal strength aluminum has rust and corrosion resistance and can be painted or anodized in various colors 62 with the high cost of lumber fewer greenhouses are constructed with wood and traditional wooden benches are being replaced by rigid plastics metal benches and other synthetic materials greenhouse heating and cooling systems ventilation to provide air movement and air exchange with the outside is necessary in all greenhouses to aid in controlling temperature and humidity a mechanism for manual opening of panels at the ridge and sides or with passive ventilation can be used in smaller greenhouses but most larger installations use a forcedair fan and padcooling ventilation system either regulated by thermostats or controlled by computer 42 89 traditionally greenhouses have been heated by steam or hot water from a central boiler through banks of pipes some finned to increase radiation surface suitably located in the greenhouse fig 2 unit heaters for each house with fans for improved air circulation are also used if oil or gas heaters are used they must be vented to the outside because the combustion products are toxic to plants and people and ethylene gas generated can adversely affect plant growth in large greenhouses heated air is often blown into large30 to 60 cm 12 to 24 in4mil convection polyethylene tubes hung overhead these extend the length of the greenhouse small5 to 75 cm 2 to 3 inholes spaced throughout the length of these tubes allow the hot air to escape thus giving uniform heating throughout the house these same convection tubes can be used for forcedair ventilation and cooling in summer eliminating the need for manual side and top vents gasfired infrared heaters gasfired infrared heaters are vacuumoperated radiant heaters that are sometimes installed in the ridges of greenhouses with the concept of heating the plants but not the air mass infrared heaters consist of several lines of radiant tubing running the length of the house with reflective shielding above the tubes installed at a height of 18 to 37 m 6 to 12 ft above the plants fig 2 the principal advantage of infrared heating systems in greenhouses is lower energy use cultural practices may need to be changed because infrared heating heats the plant but not the soil underneath root zone heating in contrast to infrared heating root zone heating is done by placing pipes on or below the soil surface in the floor of the greenhouse or on the benches with recirculating hot watercontrolled by a thermostatcirculating through the pipes this places the heat below the plants which hastens the germination of seeds rooting of cuttings or growth of liner plants this popular system has been very satisfactory in many installations heating the plants roots and tops but not the entire air mass in the greenhouse yielding substantial fuel savings it is also excellent for controlling foliage diseases the majority of propagation seed germination rooted cuttings and plug growing is done with some form of root zone heat figs 2 and 9 55 solar heating conservation of energy in the greenhouse is important 83 in greenhouses solar heating occurs naturally the cost of fossil fuels has evoked considerable interest in methods of conserving daytime solar heat for night heating 50 64 conservation methods need to be developed and utilized otherwise high heating costs may eventually make winter use of greenhouses in colder regions economically unfeasiblerelegating greenhouse operations to areas with relatively mild winters 89 122 most heat loss in greenhouses occurs through the roof one method of reducing heat loss in winter is to install sealed polyethylene sheeting outside over the glass or fiberglass covered structure or to use two layers of polyethylene sheeting as in a quonset house this doublepoly method of insulation is very effective the two layers are kept separate by an air cushion from a lowpressure blower energy savings from the use of this system are substantialmore than 50 percent reduction in fuel compared to conventional glass greenhousesbut the greatly lowered light intensity with the doublelayer plastic cover can lower yields of many greenhouse crops another device that reduces heat loss dramatically is a movable thermal curtain fig 10 which at night is placed between the crop and the propagation house roof and walls 119 winter heating bills are reduced as much as 30 percent since the peak of the propagation house is not heated 67 during summer automated curtains also reduce heat stress on propagules and workers and less energy is needed to run fans for cooling modified curtains can be used for light reduction during the day and black clothing for light exclusion during photoperiod manipulation of plants curtains range from 20 percent shade reduction to complete blackout curtainsuls obscura a b 67 curtain fibers are available in white black with aluminum coated fibers andor with strips of aluminum sewn in black shade cloth reduces light to the plants but absorbs heat and emits heat back into the propagation house aluminumcoated curtain fabrics are good reflectors of light but poor absorbers of heat fig 10 some curtain materials come with a top side for reflecting heat and reducing condensation and a bottom side for heat retention insulating the north wall reduces heat loss without appreciably lowering the available light heat reduction also occurs with red and blue shade cloth used for control of plant growth fig 11 greenhouses can be cooled mechanically in the summer by the use of large evaporative cooling units as shown in figure 12 the pad and fan system in which a wet pad of material such as special honeycombed cellulose aluminum mesh or plastic fiber is installed at one side or end of a greenhouse with large exhaust fans at the other has proved to be the best method of cooling greenhouses especially in lowhumidity climates 6 fog can be used to cool greenhouses but is more expensive than conventional pad and fan systems and is inefficient in climates with high relative humidity eg the texas gulf coast greenhouses are often sprayed on the outside at the onset of warm spring weather with a thin layer of whitewash or a white coldwater paint this coating reflects much of the heat from the sun thus preventing excessively high temperatures in the greenhouse during summer the whitewash is removed in the fall too heavy a coating of whitewash however can reduce the light irradiance to undesirably low levels aluminized polyester fabric coverings are used for reducing heat load and can be placed on top of polyethylenecovered propagation houses fig 10,managing plant propagation environments requires specialized structures designed for efficient growth and preparation for outdoor conditions typically two main units are used a primary controlled environment for initial growth such as a greenhouse or hotbed and a secondary unit for hardening seedlings like cold frames or low tunnels greenhouses essential for rapid propagation use robust materials such as galvanized steel or aluminum with polycarbonate or glass covers providing stability and temperature control propagation heating options include gasfired infrared heaters which warm plants directly and root zone heating which warms soil to promote root growth these systems conserve energy and improve plant resilience cooling involves fanandpad systems which circulate air across wet materials to lower temperatures and reflective materials that block excess sunlight movable thermal curtains and rolling benches maximize space and manage light innovative flood floor systems automate watering and nutrient delivery while recapturing irrigation runoff reducing resource waste while highly efficient these systems require vigilant disease management due to potential contamination spread in densely packed areas overall advanced propagation structures enhance growth energy efficiency and plant health adapting to the specific needs of young plants at each growth stage keywords
environmental controls controls are needed for greenhouse heating and evaporative cooling systems although varying with the plant species a minimum night temperature of 13 to 155c 55 to 60f is common thermostats for evaporative cooling are generally set to start the fans at about 24c 75f in the early days of greenhouse operation light temperature and humidity were about the only environmental controls attempted spraying the greenhouse with whitewash in summer and opening and closing side and ridge vents with a crank to control temperatures along with turning on steam valves at night to prevent freezing constituted environmental control humidity was increased by spraying the walks and benches by hand at least once a day later it was found that thermostats operating solenoid valves could activate electric motors to raise and lower vents and to open and close steam and water valves thus giving some degree of automatic control most environmental controllers of greenhouse environments are now analog or computerized systems analog environmental controls analog controls ie wadsworth step 500 have evolved for controlling the greenhouse environment they use proportioning thermostats or electronic sensors to gather temperature information this information drives amplifiers and electronic logic ie decision making circuitry 55 essentially they combine functions of several thermostats into one unit 10 analog controls cost more than thermostats but are more versatile and offer better performance computerized environmental controls the advent of computer technology ie wadsworth envirostep has replaced the amplifiers and logic circuits of an analog control with a microprocessor computer on a chip figs 13 and 14 computer controls are quicker and more precise in combining information from a variety of sensors temperature relative humidity light intensity wind direction to make complex judgments about how to control the propagation environment computers can be utilized as zone controllers or in more expensive integrated computer systems 10 55 although more costly than thermostats or analogs computer controls offer significant energy and labor savings and improved production efficiency in propagation not only can temperature ventilation and humidity be controlled but many other factors such as propagating bed temperatures application of liquid fertilizers through the irrigation system daylength lighting lightintensity regulation with mechanically operated shade cloth and thermal sheets or curtains operation of a mist or fog system and co2 enrichmentall can be varied for different times of the day and night and for different banks of propagation units 7 47 56 124 computers can be programmed so that alarms are triggered or propagators paged by phone if deviations from preset levels occursuch as a heating failure on a cold winter night or a mist system failure on cuttings on a hot summer day some of these operations are shown in figures 12 13 14 and 15 most importantly the computer can provide data on all factors being controlled for review to determine if changes are needed this makes it easier for the propagator to make management decisions based on factual information 42 greenhouse covering materials common greenhouse covering materials include 54 103 glass flexible covering materials rigid covering materials glass glasscovered greenhouses are expensive but for a permanent longterm installation under lowlight winter conditions glass may be more satisfactory than the popular lowcost polyethylene polycovered houses due to economics and the revolution in greenhouse covering materials from polyethylene to polycarbonates glass greenhouses are no longer dominant glass is still used due in part to its superior light transmitting properties and less excessive relative humidity problems glass breathes the glass laps between panes allow air to enter whereas polyethylene acrylic and polycarbonatestructured sheet houses are airtight which can result in excessive humidity and undesirable water drip on the plants if not properly controlled this problem can be overcome however by maintaining adequate ventilation and heating some of the newer greenhouse covering materials are designed to channel condensation to gutters avoiding water dripping onto plant foliage control of high relative humidity is a key cultural technique to manage plant pathogens since water can both disseminate pathogens and encourage plant infection see the section on cultural controls in propagation under integrated pest management later in the chapter flexible covering materials are categorized as follows polyethylene polythene poly over half of the greenhouse area in the united states is covered with lowcost polyethylene poly most with inflated double layers giving good insulating properties poly is the most popular covering for propagation houses several types of plastic are available but most propagators use either single or doublelayered polyethylene poly materials are lightweight and relatively inexpensive compared with glass their light weight also permits a less expensive supporting framework than is required for glass polyethylene has a relatively short life it breaks down in sunlight and must be replaced after one or two years generally in the fall in preparation for winter the new polys with ultraviolet uv inhibitors can last three to four years but in the southern united states where uv levels are higher poly deteriorates more quickly and propagation houses need to be recovered more frequently a thickness of 4 to 6 mils 1 mil 0001 in is recommended for better insulation and lowered winter heating costs a double layer of uvinhibited copolymer material is used with a 25cm 1in air gap between layers kept separated by air pressure from a small blower singlelayer polyethylenecovered greenhouses lose more heat at night or in winter than a glasscovered house since polyethylene allows passage of heat energy from the soil and plants inside the greenhouse much more readily than glass there are some newer infrared reflective polys which save fuel but have lower light penetration than regular poly glass traps most infrared radiation whereas polyethylene is transparent to it however double layer polycovered greenhouses retain more heat than glass because the houses are more airtight and less infrared radiation escapes only materials especially prepared for greenhouse covering should be used many installations especially in windy areas use a supporting material usually welded wire mesh for the polyethylene film occasionally other supporting materials such as saran cloth are used polyethylene transmits about 85 percent of the suns light which is low compared with glass but it passes all wavelengths of light required for plant growth a tough white opaque film consisting of a mixture of polyethylene and vinyl plastic is available this film stays more flexible under low winter temperatures than does clear polyethylene but is more expensive because temperature fluctuates less under opaque film than under clear plastic it is suitable for winter protection of fieldbed or containergrown liner plants fig 16 polyethylene permits the passage of oxygen and carbon dioxide necessary for the growth processes of plants while reducing the passage of water vapor for covering lath and shade structures there are a number of satisfactory plastic materials prepared for the horticultural industry some commercially available materials include uvtreated crosswoven polyethylene and polypropylene fabric that resists ripping and tearing and knitted highdensity uv polyethylene shade cloth and saran cloth that is strong and has greater longevity rigid covering structured sheet materials rigid covering structured sheet materials are categorized as follows acrylic plexiglass lucite exolite acrylic is highly weather resistant does not yellow with age has excellent light transmission properties retains twice the heat of glass and is very resistant to impact but is brittle it is somewhat more expensive and nearly as combustible as fiberglass it is available in twinwall construction which gives good insulation properties and has a nodrip construction that channels condensation to run down to the gutters rather than dripping on plants polycarbonate polygal lexan cyroflex dynaglas polycarbonate is probably the most widely used structured sheet material today 55 similar to acrylic in heat retention properties it allows about 90 percent of the light transmission of glass polycarbonate has high impact strengthabout 200 times that of glass it is lightweight about onesixth that of glass making it easy to install polycarbonates textured surface diffuses light and reduces condensation drip it is available in twinwall construction which gives good insulation properties polycarbonate can be cut sawn drilled or nailed and is much more userfriendly than acrylic which can shatter if nails or screws are driven into it it is uv stabilized and will resist long outdoor exposure some polycarbonates are guaranteed for ten years but will eventually yellow with age 11 90 fiberglass rigid panels corrugated or flat of polyester resin reinforced with fiberglass have been widely used for greenhouse construction this material is strong longlasting lightweight and easily applied and comes in a variety of dimensions width length and thickness but is not as permanent as glass only the clear material especially made for greenhouses and in a thickness of 0096 cm 0038 in or more and weighing 4 to 5 oz per square footshould be used new material transmits about 80 to 90 percent of the available light but light transmission decreases over the years due to yellowing which is a serious problem since fiberglass burns rapidly an entire greenhouse may quickly be consumed by fire so insurance costs can be higher fiberglass is more expensive than polyethylene and is not as widely used as it once was the economics of using these greenhouse covering materials must be considered carefully before a decision is made new materials are continually coming onto the market,greenhouses rely on environmental controls and covering materials to create optimal conditions for plant growth temperature and humidity are managed through thermostats keeping night temperatures between 13155c and starting cooling fans at 24c historically greenhouse control was manual involving whitewashing for shade and hand spraying to maintain humidity modern greenhouses however use advanced analog and computerized systems such as the wadsworth step 500 and envirostep these systems combine data from various sensors temperature humidity light wind to automatically regulate greenhouse conditions including co enrichment light intensity and ventilation computerized controls provide faster precise adjustments saving energy and labor and even send alerts for equipment malfunctions greenhouse coverings play a significant role in insulation durability and light transmission while glass is highly transparent and breathable its more expensive polyethylene commonly used in double layers is economical and offers good insulation though it has a shorter lifespan polycarbonate and acrylic provide high impact resistance with polycarbonate diffusing light well and providing durability with insulation fiberglass is lightweight and strong but can yellow over time choosing the right material depends on the balance needed between light transmission durability and insulation requirements for optimal plant propagation
closedcase propagation systems hot frames hotbeds and heated sun tunnels the hot frame hotbed is a small low structure used for many of the same purposes as a propagation house traditionally the hotbed is a large wooden box or frame with a sloping tightfitting lid made of window sash hotbeds can be used throughout the year except in areas with severe winters where their use may be restricted to spring summer and fall another form of a hotbed is a heated low polyethylene tunnel or sun tunnel that is made from hooped metal tubing or bent pvc pipe which is covered with polyethylene sometimes a white poly material is used to avoid the higher temperature buildup and temperature fluctuations of clear poly fig 16 traditionally the size of the frame conforms to the size of the glass sash availablea standard size is 09 by 18 m 3 by 6 ft fig 17 if polyethylene is used as the covering any convenient dimensions can be used the frame can be easily built with 3cm 1in or 6cm 2in lumber nailed to 4by4 corner posts set in the ground decayresistant wood such as redwood cypress or cedar should be used and preferably pressuretreated with wood preservatives such as chromated copper arsenate cca this compound retards decay for many years and does not give off fumes toxic to plants creosote must not be used on wood structures in which plants will be grown since the fumes released particularly on hot days are toxic to plants plastic or pvc tubing with recirculating hot water is quite satisfactory for providing bottom heat in hotbeds the hotbed is filled with 10 to 15 cm 4 to 6 in of a rooting or seedgerminating medium over the hotwater tubing alternatively community propagation flats or flats with liner pots containing the medium can be used these are placed directly on a thin layer of sand covering the hotwater tubing seedlings can be started and leafy cuttings rooted in hotbeds early in the season as in the greenhouse close attention must be paid to shading and ventilation as well as to temperature and humidity control for small propagation operations hotbed structures are suitable for producing many thousands of nursery plants without the higher construction expenditure for larger walkin propagation houses 60 cold frames and unheated sun tunnels a primary use of cold frames is conditioning or hardening rooted cuttings or young seedlings liners preceding field nurseryrow or container planting cold frames and unheated sun tunnels can be used for starting new plants in late spring summer or fall when no external supply of heat is necessary 129 today cold frames include not only low polyethylenecovered wood frames or unheated sun tunnels that people cannot walk within fig 17 but also lowcost polycovered hoop houses fig 17 the covered frames should fit tightly in order to retain heat and obtain high humidity cold frames should be placed in locations protected from winds with the sash cover sloping down from north to south south to north in the southern hemisphere lowcost cold frame construction fig 17 is the same as for hotbeds except that no provision is made for supplying bottom heat with olderstyle cold frames sometimes a lath covering with open spaces between the lath boards is used to cover the cold frame this does not prevent freezing temperatures from occurring but does reduce high and low temperature fluctuations in these structures only the heat of the sun retained by the transparent or opaque white polyethylene coverings is utilized close attention to ventilation shading watering and winter protection is necessary for success with cold frames when young tender plants are first placed in a cold frame the covers are generally kept tightly closed to maintain a high humidity but as the plants become acclimated the sash frames are gradually raised or the ends of the hoop house or sun tunnels opened to permit more ventilation and drier conditions the installation of a mist line or frequent irrigation of plants in a cold frame is essential to maintain humid conditions during sunny days temperatures can build up to excessively high levels in closed frames unless ventilation and shading are provided spaced lath saran or poly shade clothcovered frames or reed mats are useful to lay over the sash to provide protection from the sun in areas where extremely low temperatures occur plants being overwintered in cold frames may require additional protective coverings lathhouses lathhouses or shade houses figs 6 and 11 provide outdoor shade and protect containergrown plants from high summer temperatures and high light irradiance 50 they reduce moisture stress and decrease the water requirements of plants lathhouses have many uses in propagation particularly in conjunction with the hardeningoff and acclimation of liner plants prior to transplanting and with maintenance of shaderequiring or tender plants at times a lathhouse is used by nurseries simply to hold plants for sale in mild climates they are used for propagation along with a mist facility and can also be used as an overwintering structure for liner plants snow load can cause problems in higher latitude regions lathhouse construction varies widely aluminum prefabricated lathhouses are available but may be more costly than wood structures more commonly pipe or wood supports are used set in concrete with the necessary supporting crossmembers today most lathhouses are covered with highdensity woven plastic materials such as saran polypropylene fabric and uvtreated polyethylene shade cloth which come in varying shade percentages and colors these materials are available in different densities thus allowing lower irradiance of light such as 50 percent sunlight to the plants they are lightweight and can be attached to heavy wire fastened to supporting posts the shade cloth is resistant to ripping and has an optimum life of 10 to 15 years depending on climate and quality of material for winterization in less temperate areas producers will cover the shade cloth with polyethylene sometimes shade is provided by thin wood strips about 5 cm 2 in wide placed to give onethird to twothirds cover depending on the need both sides and the top are usually covered rolls of snow fencing attached to a supporting framework can be utilized for inexpensive construction miscellaneous closedcase systems there are a number of closedcase propagation systems that are used in the rooting of cuttings acclimatization and rooting of tissue culture microcuttings and propagation of seedlings besides the sun tunnels or cold frames previously described closedcase propagation systems include nonmisted enclosures in glasshouses or polyhouses shading tent and contact polyethylene systems wet tents inverted glass jars propagating frames even in a greenhouse humidity is not always high enough to permit satisfactory rooting of certain kinds of leafy cuttings enclosed frames covered with poly or glass may be necessary for successful rooting see fig 18 there are many variations of such devices small ones were called wardian cases in earlier days such enclosed frames are also useful for graft union formation of small potted nursery stock since they retain high humidity sometimes in cool summer climates as far south as virginia in the united states when fall semihardwood cuttings are taken a layer of very thin 1 or 2 mils polyethylene laid directly on top of a bed of newly prepared leafy cuttings in a greenhouse or lathhouse will provide a sufficient increase in relative humidity to give good rooting this is sometimes referred to as a contact polyethylene system good shade control to reduce light irradiance is essential for this system on a more limited scale bell jars large inverted glass jars can be set over a container of unrooted cuttings or freshly grafted containerized plants to speed up graft union formation humidity is kept high in such devices but some shading is necessary to control temperature in using all such structures care is necessary to avoid the buildup of pathogenic organisms the warm humid conditions combined with lack of air movement and relatively low light intensity provide excellent conditions for the growth of various pathogenic fungi and bacteria cleanliness of all materials placed in such units is important however use of fungicides is sometimes necessary see the section on integrated pest management later in the chapter enclosed poly sweat tenthydroponic system an australian producer of chrysanthemums uses a modified nutrient film technique nft for growing greenhouse stock plants and propagating cuttings 58 unrooted cuttings are stuck in oasis root cubes and placed in mist propagation benches containing a reservoir of water maintained with a float valve the system is initially enclosed in a clear poly sweat tent once root initiation takes place the mist is turned off and the poly tent lifted cuttings are then supplied with nutrient solution in the nft system on the propagation bench and later transplanted with the roots intact and undisturbed in the root cube stock plants are also maintained in the nft system and supported in root cubes thus allowing more precise nutritional control and reduction in environmental stress to the stock plant,closedcase propagation systems are specialized structures designed to create controlled environments for efficient plant propagation hot frames hotbeds and heated sun tunnels are low insulated frames that use electric or water heating systems to provide warmth facilitating earlyseason seed germination and rooting of cuttings typically covered with polyethylene they retain humidity and require careful attention to shading and ventilation to prevent overheating cold frames and unheated sun tunnels utilize sunlight to maintain warmth making them suitable for conditioning young plants before field or container planting these structures should fit tightly to retain heat and moisture with ventilation gradually increased as plants acclimate lathhouses or shade houses provide essential shade for containergrown plants reducing moisture stress and maintaining optimal conditions for tender species during high temperatures covered with uvresistant materials they help protect plants from excessive sunlight other closedcase systems like propagating frames and sweat tents maintain high humidity for successful grafting and rooting they create conditions ideal for plant growth but can promote pathogen development necessitating strict hygiene and sometimes fungicide applications innovative setups like nutrientfilm hydroponic systems further optimize propagation conditions enhancing plant health and growth efficiency
containers for propagating and growing young liner plants new types of containers for propagating and growing young liner plants are continually being developed usually with a goal of reducing handling costs direct sticking of unrooted cuttings into small liner containers as opposed to sticking into conventional propagation trays saves a production step and later avoids root disturbance of cuttings which can lead to transplant shock figs 19 20 and 21 31 flats flats are shallow plastic styrofoam wooden or metal trays with drainage holes in the bottom they are useful for germinating seeds or rooting cuttings since they permit young plants to be moved easily in the past durable kinds of wood such as cypress cedar or redwood were preferred for flats the most popular flats are made of rigid plastic polyethylene polystyrene and come in all shapes and sizes the 28 53 cm 11 21 in 1020 plastic flats are the industry standard the number of cells or compartments per tray may range from 1 cell for a community rooting flat or seed germination tray to 18 or more cells for a rooted liner tray to 100 to 400 cells for a seedling plug tray trays also can be fitted with removable sheet inserts containing the cells plastic flats will nest and thus require relatively little storage space the costs of producing plastic for flats and containers and for disposing of used plastic have led to increased plastic recycling programs in horticulture and biodegradable paper tube liner pots fig 19 plastic pots plastic containers round and square have numerous advantages they are nonporous reusable lightweight and use little storage space because they will nest some types are fragile however and require careful handling although other types made from polyethylene are flexible and quite sturdy small liner pots for direct rooting of cuttings seedling propagation and tissue culture plantlet acclimatization and production have gained considerable popularity many of these small containers have riblike structures to redirect root growth and prevent girdling figs 19 20 and 22 in forestry seedling production ribbed book or sleeve containers are used which consist of two matched sections of molded plastic that fit together to form a row of rectangular cells fig 22 the inner walls of small propagation containers and liner pots can also be treated with chemical root pruning agents such as copper hydroxide cuoh2 which chemically prune liner roots at the rootwall interface 71 the chemically pruned lateral roots become suberized but will begin to grow again after transplanting which results in a welldistributed root system that helps minimize transplant shock fig 23 71 plastic pots and flats cannot be steam sterilized but some of the more common plant pathogens can be controlled by a hot water dip 70c 158f for 3 minutes followed by a rinse in a dilute bleach solution ie clorox purex etc ultraviolet light inhibitors are sometimes incorporated in the plastic resin to prevent uv degradation of plastic pots under full sun conditions fig 24 fiber pots containers of various sizes round or square are pressed into shape from peat plus wood fiber with fertilizer added dry they will keep indefinitely since these pots are biodegradable they are set in the soil along with the plants peat pots find their best use where plants are to be held for a relatively short time and then put in a larger container or in the field during outplanting in the field any portion of the fiber pot transplanted above the surface of the soil will act like a wick and quickly dry out the transplant during production small peat pots with plants growing in them eventually deteriorate because of constant moisture and may fall apart when moved on the other hand unless the pots are kept moist roots will fail to penetrate the walls of the pot and will grow into an undesirable spiral pattern units of 6 or 12 square peat pots fastened together are available when large numbers of plants are involved using peat pots results in time and labor savings paper pots paper pots or paper tube pots are more popular with seed plug and cutting propagation of ornamentals vegetable and forestry species they allow for greater mechanization with potfilling machines automatic seeders and wire benches that allow air pruning of the root system typically paper pots consist of a series of interconnected paper cells arranged in a honeycomb pattern that can be separated before outplanting 71 an advantage of the paper pot system is that pots are biodegradable and the seedling plug can be planted intact into a larger container or into the ground without disturbing the root system some papiermch pots paper wax asphalt come treated with copper hydroxide which enhances root development and retards deterioration of the pot in europe and the united states paper tube pots with predictable degradation rates are produced by machine 39 the propagation medium is formed into a continuous cylinder and wrapped with a length of paper or cellulose skin that is glued and heat sealed fig 19 peat fiber expanded foam and rockwool blocks blocks of solid material sometimes with a prepunched hole fig 22 have become popular as a germinating medium for seeds and as a rooting medium for cuttings especially for such plants as chrysanthemums and poinsettias sometimes fertilizers are incorporated into the material one type is made of highly compressed peat which when water is added swells to its usable size and is soft enough for the cutting or seed to be inserted such blocks become a part of the plant unit and are set in the soil along with the plant these blocks replace not only the pot but also the propagating mix synthetic rooting blocks oasis rockwool are becoming more widely used in the nursery industry and forestry industry for seed propagation and are well adapted to automation fig 22 other advantages are their light weight consistent quality reproducibility and clean condition watering must be carefully controlled to provide constant moisture while maintaining adequate aeration plastic growing containers for postliner production many millions of nursery plants are grown and marketed each year in 38liter 1gal andto a lesser extent11liter 3gal 19liter 5gal and larger containers they are tapered for nesting and have drainage holes heavywall injectionmolded plastic containers are used extensively in the united states machine planters have been developed utilizing containers in which rooted cuttings or seedlings can be transplanted as rapidly as 10000 or more a day see the horticulture and forestry nursery production flow diagrams fig 21 plants are easily removed from tapered containers by inverting and tapping some plastic containers are made of preformed hinged plastic sheets that can be separated for easy removal of the liner fig 22 in areas with high summer temperatures use of lightcolored white or silver containers may improve root growth by reducing heat damage to the roots which is often encountered in darkcolored containers that absorb considerable heat when exposed to the sun however lightcolored containers show dirt marks as opposed to black or dark green containers and must be cleaned prior to shipping more and more colorful labeled containers are being used for growing and merchandising landscape and garden plants fig 24 a potinpot system in which a containerized plant is inserted into a hole in the ground lined with a plastic sleeve pot helps moderate both high and low rootball temperatures fig 25 polyethylene bags and plant rolls polyethylene bags are widely used in europe australia new zealand and in less developed countries in the tropicsbut rarely in north americafor growing rooted cuttings or seedling liners to a salable size they are considerably less expensive than rigid plastic containers and seem to be satisfactory fig 24 but some types deteriorate rapidly they are usually black but some are black on the inside and lightcolored on the outside the lighter color reflects heat and lowers the root temperature polybags do not prohibit root spiraling or allow air pruning which is a drawback to their use in propagation and liner production however poly tubes are openended which reduces girdling problems after planting they cannot be stacked as easily as the rigid containers for truck transportationthe polybags often break and the root system of the plant is more easily damaged a lowcost method of propagating some easytoroot species is with a polyethylene plant roll the basal ends of the cuttings are inserted in damp peat moss or sphagnum and rolled into the doubledover plastic sheeting the roll of cuttings is then set upright in a humid location for rooting polyethylene starter pouches with an absorbent paper inserted in the pouch are used for germinating selected seed lots wood containers large cedarwood containers or boxes are used for growing large specimen trees and shrubs to provide instant landscaping for the customer some of the specimen trees are 8 to 9 years old and weigh up to 3700 kg 8100 lbs heavy moving equipment is required for handling such large nursery stock fig 26,containers for propagating and growing young liner plants vary widely designed to enhance plant growth and reduce handling costs major container types include flats plastic pots fiber pots paper pots peat and fiber blocks and polyethylene bags each has unique properties and applications in plant propagation flats are shallow trays ideal for germinating seeds or rooting cuttings they come in various materials and can be nested for easy storage plastic pots are nonporous reusable and prevent root spiraling often using ribbed designs and chemical root pruners like copper hydroxide fiber pots made from biodegradable materials like peat and wood fiber allow for planting without pot removal but require consistent moisture paper pots are suited for mechanized seeding and biodegradable promoting root health when planted directly in soil peat and fiber blocks are compressed and waterabsorbent offering an allinone solution for germination and planting polyethylene bags are lightweight and inexpensive but lack root air pruning and can lead to root spiraling other options like wood containers support larger plants in landscaping some container features such as uv protection or specific shapes help control root temperature and improve root health
management of media and nutrition in propagation and liner production media and mixes for propagating and growing young liner plants various substrates and mixtures of materials are used for germinating seeds and rooting cuttings for good results the following characteristics of the medium are required 51 the medium must be sufficiently firm and dense to hold the cuttings or seeds in place during rooting or germination its volume must be fairly constant when either wet or dry excessive shrinkage after drying is undesirable it should be highly decomposed and stable preferably with a 20c1n ratio to prevent n immobilization and excessive shrinkage during production it must be easy to wet not too hydrophobic and retain enough moisture to reduce frequent watering it must be sufficiently porous so that excess water drains away permitting adequate penetration of oxygen to the rootsall containers produce a perched water table that creates a zone of saturated growing medium at the bottom of the container it must be free from pests weed seeds nematodes and various pathogens it must have a low salinity level it should be capable of being steampasteurized or chemically treated without harmful effects it should have a high cation exchange capacity cec for retention of nutrients that may be applied preincorporated andor in a supplementary soluble andor controlledrelease fertilizer program it should be of consistent quality from batch to batch and reproducible it should be readily available and economical propagation media used in horticulture and forestry consist of a mixture of organic and inorganic components that have different but complementary properties the organic component generally includes peat softwood and hardwood barks or sphagnum moss sawdust and rice hulls should be avoided since they oxidize readily and compact easily which decreases pore space and aeration and they have a high cn ratio which can result in nutritional problems for the propagule a coarse mineral component is used to improve drainage and aeration by increasing the proportion of large airfilled pores a variety of mineral components include sand avoid fine particle sands grit pumice scoria expanded shale perlite vermiculite polystyrene clay granules and rockwool there is no single ideal mix an appropriate propagation medium depends on the species propagule type season and propagation system ie with fog a waterlogged medium is less of a problem than with mist cost and availability of the medium components are other considerations the following media components can be used in propagation systems soil a mineral soil is composed of materials in the solid liquid and gaseous states for satisfactory plant growth these materials must exist in the proper proportions the solid portion of a soil is comprised of both inorganic and organic components the inorganic part consists of the residue from parent rock after decomposition resulting from the chemical and physical process of weathering such inorganic components vary in size from gravel down to extremely minute colloidal particles of clay the texture of the soil being determined by the relative proportions of these particle sizes the coarser particles serve mainly as a supporting framework for the remainder of the soil whereas the colloidal clay fractions of the soil serve as storehouses for nutrients that are released and absorbed by plants the organic portion of the soil consists of both living and dead organisms insects worms fungi bacteria and plant roots generally constitute the living organic matter whereas the remains of such animal and plant life in various stages of decay make up the dead organic material the residue from such decay termed humus is largely colloidal and assists in holding water and plant nutrients the liquid part of the soil the soil solution is made up of water that contains dissolved salts in various quantities along with dissolved oxygen and carbon dioxide mineral elements water and some carbon dioxide enter the plant from the soil solution the gaseous portion of the soil is important to good plant growth in poorly drained waterlogged soils water replaces the air thus depriving plant roots as well as certain desirable aerobic microorganisms of the oxygen necessary for their existence the texture of a mineral soil depends upon the relative proportions of sand 005 to 2 mm particle diameter silt 005 to 0002 mm particle diameter and clay less than 0002 mm particle diameter in contrast to soil texture which refers to the proportions of individual soil particles soil structure refers to the arrangement of those particles in the entire soil mass these individual soil grains are held together in aggregates of various sizes and shapes propagation in commercial horticulture is generally done with flats containers andor pot systems using soilless media some exceptions to this are field budding and grafting systems stooling and layering systems field propagation of hardwood cuttings without intermittent mist direct seeding of crops and utilizing outdoor seedbeds with the greater reliance on containerized systems for propagation mineral soils are either unsuitable or must be amended with other components to improve aeration and prevent the compaction that occurs with the structural changes of mineral soils in a container sand sand consists of small rock particles 005 to 20 mm in diameter formed as the result of the weathering of various rocks the mineral composition of sand depends upon the type of rock quartz sand consisting chiefly of a silica complex is generally used for propagation purposes sand is the heaviest of all rooting media used with a cubic foot of dry sand weighing about 45 kg 100 lb preferably it should be fumigated or steampasteurized before use as it may contain weed seeds and various harmful pathogens sand contains virtually no mineral nutrients and has no buffering capacity or cation exchange capacity cec it is used mostly in combination with organic materials sand collected near the ocean beach sand may be too high in salts calcareous sand will raise media ph and should be tested prior to mixing with vinegar or a dilute acid peat peat consists of the remains of aquatic marsh bog or swamp vegetation that has been preserved under water in a partially decomposed state the lack of oxygen in the bog slows bacterial and chemical decomposition of the plant material composition of different peat deposits varies widely depending upon the vegetation from which it originated state of decomposition mineral content and degree of acidity 82 there are three types of peat as classified by the united states bureau of mines moss peat reed sedge and peat humus moss peat usually referred to in the market as peat or peat moss is the least decomposed of the three types and is derived from sphagnum or other mosses it varies in color from light tan to dark brown it has a high moistureholding capacity 15 times its dry weight has a high acidity ph of 32 to 45 and contains a small amount of nitrogen about 1 percent but little or no phosphorus or potassium this type of peat generally comes from canada ireland or germany although some is produced in the northern united states peat moss is the most commonly used peat in horticulture the coarse grade being the best fig 27 when peat moss is to be used in mixes it should be broken apart and moistened before being added to the mix continued addition of coarse organic materials such as peat moss or sphagnum moss to greenhouse media can initially cause a decrease in wettability water will not penetrate easily and many of the peat particles will remain dry even after watering there is no good method for preventing this nonwettability although the repeated use of commercial wetting agents such as aquagro can improve water penetration 12 peat is not a uniform product and can be a source of weed seed insects and disease inoculum peat moss is relatively expensive so it is used less in nursery propagation and production mixes it is gradually being replaced by other components such as pulverized or shredded bark however peat is still the main organic ingredient in propagation and greenhouse mixes sphagnum moss peat commercial sphagnum moss peat or sphagnum peat is the dehydrated young residue or living portions of acidbog plants in the genus sphagnum such as s papillosum s capillaceum and s palustre it is the most desirable peat for horticultural purposes but its high cost limits its commercial use it is relatively pathogenfree light in weight and has a very high waterholding capacity able to absorb 10 to 20 times its weight in water this material is generally shredded either mechanically or by hand before it is used in a propagating or growing media it contains small amounts of minerals but plants grown in it for any length of time require added nutrients sphagnum moss has a ph of about 35 to 40 it may contain specific fungistatic substances including a strain of streptomyces bacteria which can inhibit dampingoff of seedlings 2 63 vermiculite vermiculite is a micaceous mineral that expands markedly when heated extensive deposits are found in montana north carolina and south africa chemically it is a hydrated magnesiumaluminumiron silicate when expanded vermiculite is very light in weight 90 to 150 kg per cubic meter 6 to 10 lbs per cubic foot neutral in reaction with good buffering properties and insoluble in water it is able to absorb large quantities of water40 to 54 liters per cubic meter 3 to 4 gal per cubic foot vermiculite has a relatively high cationexchange capacity and thus can hold nutrients in reserve for later release it contains magnesium and potassium but supplementary amounts are needed from other fertilizer sources in crude vermiculite ore the particles consist of many thin separate layers with microscopic quantities of water trapped between them when run through furnaces at temperatures near 1090c 1994f the water turns to steam popping the layers apart and forming small porous spongelike kernels heating to this temperature provides complete sterilization horticultural vermiculite is graded to four sizes no 1 has particles from 5 to 8 mm in diameter no 2 the regular horticultural grade from 2 to 3 mm no 3 from 1 to 2 mm no 4 which is most useful as a seedgerminating medium from 075 to 1 mm expanded vermiculite should not be compacted when wet as pressing destroys its desirable porous structure do not use nonhorticultural construction grade vermiculite as it is treated with chemicals toxic to plant tissues perlite perlite a graywhite silicaceous material is of volcanic origin mined from lava flows the crude ore is crushed and screened then heated in furnaces to about 760c 1400f at which temperature the small amount of moisture in the particles changes to steam expanding the particles to small spongelike kernels that are very light weighing only 80 to 100 kg per cubic meter 5 to 65 lbs per cubic foot the high processing temperature provides a sterile product usually a particle size of 16 to 30 mm 116 to 18 in in diameter is used in horticultural applications fig 27 perlite holds three to four times its weight of water it is essentially neutral with a ph of 60 to 80 but with no buffering capacity unlike vermiculite it has no cation exchange capacity and contains no mineral nutrients perlite presents some problems with fluoridesensitive plants but fluoride can be leached out by watering heavily it is most useful in increasing aeration in a mix perlite in combination with peat moss is a very popular rooting medium for cuttings 85 perlite dust is a respiratory irritant perlite should be moistened to minimize dust and workers should use respirators calcined clay and other aggregates stable aggregates can be produced when minerals such as clay shales and pulverized fuel ash are heated calcined at high temperatures they have no fertilizer value are porous are resistant to breakdown and absorb water the main purpose of these materials is to change the physical characteristics of a propagation or liner potting mix examples of commercial materials made from clay include leca terragreen and turfice haydite is a combination of clay and shale while hortag used in the uk is made from pulverized fuel ash 16 claytype kitty litter is also a calcined clay but contains perfumes that are not desirable for propagation pumice chemically pumice is mostly silicon dioxide and aluminum oxide with small amounts of iron calcium magnesium and sodium in the oxide form it is of volcanic origin and is mined in several regions in the western united states pumice is screened to differentsize grades but is not heattreated it increases aeration and drainage in a propagation mix and can be used alone or mixed with peat moss rockwool mineral wool this material is used as a rooting and growing medium in europe australia and the united states figs 22 and 27 it is prepared from various rock sources such as basalt rock melted at a temperature of about 1600c as it cools a binder is added and it is spun into fibers and pressed into blocks horticultural rockwool is available in several formsshredded prills pellets slabs blocks cubes or combined with peat moss as a mixture rockwool will hold a considerable amount of water yet retains good oxygen levels with the addition of fertilizers it can be used in place of the peatlite mixes before switching from more traditional media mixes it is best to initially conduct smallscale propagation trials with rockwool and other new media components as they become commercially available 51 shredded bark shredded or pulverized softwood bark from redwood cedar fir pine hemlock or various hardwood bark species such as oaks and maples can be used as an organic component in propagation and growing mixes and are frequently substituted for peat moss at a lower cost 89 91 102 112 128 before it is used as a growing medium pine bark is hammermilled into smaller component pieces stockpiled in the open and often composted by turning the piles and watering as needed fresh barks may contain materials toxic to plants such as phenols resins terpenes and tannins composting for 10 to 14 weeks before using reduces phenolic levels in bark and improves its wettability as media and the higher bark pile temperatures help reduce insect and pathogen levels 16 because of their moderate cost light weight and availability barks are very popular and widely used in mixes for propagation and containergrown plants fig 27 wetting agents and gels increase available water content in pine bark and may play a greater role in helping propagators reduce irrigation frequency or the volume of water required during each irrigation 12 coconut fibercoir coconut fiber coir is an economical peat substitute that can be mixed with a mineral component as propagation media it is derived from coconut husks compost in some countries compost is synonymous with container media for propagation and plant growth however we define compost composting as the product of biological decomposition of bulk organic wastes under controlled conditions which takes place in piles or bins the process occurs in three steps a an initial stage lasting a few days in which decomposition of easily degradable soluble materials occurs b a second stage lasting several months during which high temperatures occur and cellulose compounds are broken down and c a final stabilization stage when decomposition decreases temperatures lower and microorganisms recolonize the material microorganisms include bacteria fungi and nematodes larger organisms such as millipedes soil mites beetles springtails earthworms earwigs slugs and sowbugs can often be found in compost piles in great numbers compost prepared largely from leaves may have a high soluble salt content which will inhibit plant growth but salinity can be lowered by leaching with water before use in the future with dwindling landfill sites and environmental pressures to recycle organic scrapage materials the use of composted yard wastes chicken and cow manure organic sludge from municipal sewage treatment plants and so on will play a greater role as media components in the propagation and production of small liner plants many nurseries recycle culled containerized plants and shred the plant and soil as compost or as a medium component to be mixed with fresh container medium composted sewage sludge not only provides organic matter but nearly all the essential trace elements and a large percentage of major elements needed by plants in a slowly available form 53 mixes should always be analyzed for heavy metals and soluble salt levels the usual recommended rate is that compost not comprise more than 30 percent of the volume of the mix 16,propagation media a blend of organic and inorganic materials is essential for successful germination and rooting for effective propagation the media should be stable moistureretentive wellaerated and pestfree organic components such as peat shredded bark and sphagnum moss add moisture retention and structure with peat moss being widely used due to its high waterholding capacity and acidic ph alternatives like coir from coconut husks are increasingly popular for being costeffective mineral componentssand vermiculite and perliteimprove drainage and aeration by creating airfilled pores vermiculite has high cation exchange capacity cec aiding nutrient retention whereas perlite is lighter and neutral but has no cec soilless media are generally preferred in horticulture to prevent soil compaction in containers compost a product of decomposed organic waste can provide nutrients and is increasingly used as part of propagation media to promote sustainability some mixes also include calcined clay and other aggregates to adjust moisture levels and improve structure the ideal propagation mix balances these organic and mineral components to support stability consistent moisture nutrient availability and oxygenationcreating optimal conditions for young plants growth and health
suggested mixesmedia and preplant granular fertilizers for container growing during propagation and liner production following propagation young seedlings rooted cuttings or acclimatized tissue culture plantlets liners are sometimes planted directly in the field but frequently are started in a blended soilless mix in some type of container container growing of young seedlings and rooted cuttings has become an important alternative for field growers in the southern and western united states more than 80 percent of nursery plants are container produced 35 for this purpose special growing mixes are needed 99 128 it is sometimes more economical for a propagator to buy bags or bulk forms of premixed media typically they are composed of a peat or peatvermiculite peatperlite hammermilled and composted bark rockwool and other combinations preplant amendments in these mixes normally include dolomitic limestone wetting agents surfactants to improve water retention and drainage of the peat or bark starter fertilizers trace elements and sometimes gypsum and a ph buffer in preparing container mixes the media should be screened for uniformity to eliminate excessively large particles if the materials are very dry they should be moistened slightly this applies particularly to peat and bark which if mixed when dry absorb moisture very slowly in mixing the various ingredients may be arranged in layers in a pile and turned with a shovel a powerdriven cement mixer soil shredder or frontend loader is used in largescale operations most nurseries omit mineral soil from their mixes the majority of container mixes for propagation and liner production use an organic component such as a bark or peat which solely or in combination is mixed with mineral components such as sand vermiculite or pumice depending on their availability and cost preparation of the mixture should preferably take place at least a day prior to use during the ensuing 24 hours the moisture tends to become equalized throughout the mixture the mixture should be just slightly moist at the time of use so that it does not crumble on the other hand it should not be sufficiently wet to form a ball when squeezed in the hand 44 with barks and other organic matter and supplementary components particularly rice hulls and sugarcane begasse it is necessary to compost the material for a period of months before using it as a container medium component container mixes require fertilizer supplements and continued feeding of the plants until they become established in their permanent locations 132 for example one successful mix for small seedlings rooted cuttings and bedding plants consists of one part each of shredded fir or hammermilled pine bark peat moss perlite and sand to this mixture is added preplant fertilizers gypsum dolomitic limestone microelements and sometimes controlledrelease fertilizer postplant fertilizerssoluble forms of nitrogen phosphorus and potassiumare added later to the irrigation water fertigation or as a top dressing of controlledrelease fertilizer such as osmocote or nutricote in summary nurseries have changed from loambased growing media as exemplified by the john innes composts developed in england in the 1900s to soilless mixes incorporating such materials as finely shredded bark peat sand perlite vermiculite and pumice in varying proportions the trend away from loambased mixes is due to a lack of suitable uniform soils the added costs of having to pasteurize soil mixes and the costs of handling and shipping the heavier soils compared with lighter media materials much experimentation takes place in trying to develop other lowcost readily available bulk material to be used as a component of growing mixes such as spent mushroom compost papermill sludge 21 26 composted sewage sludge 53 and other materials the cornell peatlite mixes the cornell peatlite mixes like the earlier university of california uc potting mixes are soilless media first developed in the mid1960s they are used primarily for seed germination and for container growing of bedding plants annuals and flowering potted plants the components are lightweight uniform readily available and have chemical and physical characteristics suitable for the growth of plants excellent results have been obtained with these mixes it may be desirable however to pasteurize the peat moss before use to eliminate any disease inoculum or other plant pests finely shredded bark is often substituted for the peat moss the term peatlite refers to peatbased media containing perlite or vermiculite peatlite mix c for germinating seeds to make 076 m3 1 cubic yard 0035 m3 12 ft3 shredded german or canadian sphagnum peat moss 0035 m3 12 ft3 horticultural grade vermiculite no 4 fine 42 g 15 oz4 level tbsp ammonium nitrate 42 g 15 oz2 level tbsp superphosphate 20 percent powdered 210 g 75 oz10 level tbsp finely ground dolomitic limestone the materials should be mixed thoroughly with special attention to wetting the peat moss during mixing adding a nonionic wetting agent such as aquagro 28 g 1 oz per 23 liter 6 gal of water usually aids in wetting the peat moss many commercial readymixed preparations based on the original cornell peatlite mixes are available in bulk or bags and are widely used by propagators and producers some mixes are prefilled into cell packs seed trays or pots that are ready to be planted some soilless proprietary mixes are very sophisticated containing peat moss vermiculite and perlite plus a nutrient charge of nitrogen potassium phosphorus dolomitic limestone micronutrients and a wetting agent with the ph adjusted to about 65 proprietary micronutrient materials such as esmigran fte 503 or micromax consisting of combinations of minor elements are available for adding to growing media adding a controlledrelease fertilizer such as osmocote magamp nutriform nutricote or polyon to the basic peatlite mix is useful if the plants are to be grown in it for an extended period of time managing plant nutrition with postplant fertilization during and after the propagation cycle developing an efficient fertilizer program for container plants for the 21st century depends on a minimizing the loss of fertilizer from the production area and b increasing the amount of fertilizer utilized or taken up by the plant 133 134 suggested levels of preincorporated preplant granular fertilizers were discussed in the previous section on container media for propagation and small linear production this section discusses some general fertilization practices for management of plant nutrition during propagation and liner production fig 21 both soluble and slowrelease fertilizers are utilized liquid fertilizers for largescale greenhouse and nursery operations it is more practical to prepare a liquid concentrate and inject it into the regular watering or irrigating system by the use of a proportioner fertigation the most economical source of fertilizers to be applied through the irrigation water is from dealers who manufacture soluble liquid fertilizer for field crops it is no longer recommended to use superphosphate in soilless mixes with outdoor container production because of the phosphorus leaching that occurs hence more efficient soluble forms of phosphorus are used such as phosphoric acid or ammonium phosphate in liquid feed programs potassium is typically applied as potassium chloride or potassium nitrate and nitrogen as uran 30 15 percent urea 15 percent nh4no3 or ammonium nitrate in the liquid concentrate an example of a liquid fertilizer system for production of containerized plants is the virginia tech system vts with the vts all nutrients are supplied to the container by injecting liquid fertilizers into the irrigation water 131 132 a 10n4p2o56k2o analysis liquid fertilizer is applied five times per week 13 cm 05 in each irrigation at an application rate of 100 to 80 ppm n 15 to 10 ppm p and 50 to 40 ppm k sometimes higher nitrogen levels are applied 200300 ppm n depending on the time of the year plant growth conditions or plant species it is critical to regularly monitor soluble salt levels of the medium prior to fertigation supplemental micronutrients are also applied in a liquid form but from separate tanks and with separate injectors to prevent fertilizer precipitation it is best to monitor soluble salt levels of the irrigation water by measuring electrical conductivity ec with a conductivity meter that is to apply 100 ppm n the injector is set so that the conductivity of the irrigation water minus the conductivity of the water before the fertilizer was injectedreads 055 mscm millisiemens per cm or ds per m are the same units of measure 132134 controlledrelease fertilizers crf controlledrelease fertilizers crf provide nutrients to the plants gradually over a long period and reduce the possibility of injury from excessive applications 127 there has been a longterm trend of nurseries in the southern united states incorporating crf in propagation liner and production media and spotfertilizing via liquid fertilizer fertigation or topdressing with crf crfs are some of the most costeffective and ecologically friendly ways to fertilize plants because fertilizer is applied directly to the pots in contrast overhead fertigation with rainbird sprinklertype systems is only about 30 percent efficient and greater fertilizer runoff occurs from the container production area examples of crf include osmocote phycote nutricote and polyon and some are available with micronutrients incorporated in the pellets as previously described for both cutting and seed propagation a low concentration of macro and micro crf can be included in the propagation mix so the newly formed roots can have nutrients available for absorption 37 this is particularly important with mist propagation where nutrients can be leached out from both the plant and the medium two types of crf include coated watersoluble pellets or granules and inorganic materials that are slowly soluble while slowrelease organic fertilizer includes organic materials of low solubility that gradually decompose by biological breakdown or by chemical hydrolysis examples of the resincoatedtype pellets are a osmocote whose release rate depends on the thickness of the coating and b nutricote 105 whose release rate depends on a release agent in the coating after a period of time the fertilizer will have completely diffused out of the pellets 130 another kind of controlledrelease fertilizer is the sulfurcoated urea granules consisting of urea coated with a sulfurwax mixture so that the final product is made up of about 82 percent urea 13 percent sulfur 2 percent wax 2 percent diatomaceous earth and 1 percent clay conditioner an example of the slowly soluble inorganic type crf is magamp magnesium ammonium phosphate an inorganic material of low water solubility added to the soilless mix it supplies nutrients slowly for up to 2 years magamp may be incorporated into media prior to steam pasteurization without toxic effects on the other hand steam pasteurization and sand abrasion in the preparation of mixes containing resincoated slowrelease fertilizers such as osmocote can lead to premature breakdown of the pellets and high soluble salt toxicity an example of the slowrelease organic lowsolubility type is ureaformaldehyde uf which will supply nitrogen slowly over a long period of time another organic slowrelease fertilizer is isobutylidene diurea ibdu which is a condensation product of urea and isobutylaldehyde having 31 percent nitrogen fertilizer systems for propagation commercial propagators often apply moderate levels of controlledrelease macro and micro elements to the propagation mediapreincorporated into the mediaprior to sticking cuttings and starting seed germination and seedling plug production during propagation supplemental fertilizer is added by top dressing broadcasting with controlledrelease fertilizer or by injecting gradually increasing concentrations of liquid fertilizer fertigation these supplementary nutrients do not promote root initiation 30 66 in cuttings but rather enhance root development after root primordia initiation has occurred hence supplementary fertilization is generally delayed until cuttings have begun to root propagation turnover occurs more quickly and plant growth is maintained by producing rooted liners and plugs that are more nutritionally fit some recommended levels of crf for propagation are 36 kgm3 6 lbyd3 18612 osmocote or comparable product 06 kgm3 1 lbyd3 micromax or other trace element mixturesperk esmigran or fte 503 for unrooted cuttings fastgerminating seeds and tissue culture liners crf are preincorporated in the propagation media for slower rooting or seedgerminating species use osmocote 153 gm2 05 ozft2 nutricote and others are topdressed on the media after rooting or seed germination starts to occur determining optimum levels of fertilization for propagation depends on the propagule system and needs to be determined on a species basis 30,in container propagation young plants like seedlings and rooted cuttings grow best in lightweight soilless mixes these mixes often consisting of peat vermiculite and bark are designed to hold moisture support root growth and provide essential nutrients preplant amendments such as dolomitic limestone for ph balance wetting agents to improve water retention and trace nutrients prepare the medium for planting the widely used cornell peatlite mix includes peat with perlite or vermiculite for improved drainage making it ideal for bedding plants and seeds fertilization is crucial for plant growth especially in the form of controlledrelease fertilizers crfs and liquid fertilizers crfs like osmocote and nutricote release nutrients over time due to special coatings that dissolve gradually reducing the risk of nutrient leaching and allowing efficient steady feeding liquid fertilizers often applied through irrigation a process known as fertigation provide nutrients in precise amounts monitoring the soluble salt levels in the medium helps prevent nutrient buildup and supplements can be added as needed together these practices improve growth efficiency and sustainability making soilless mixes and wellmanaged fertilization key to successful container propagation
the biotechnology century and its workforce can you imagine a world free of diseases where food is abundant for everyone and the environment is free of pollution these scenarios are exactly what many people in the biotechnology industry envision as they dedicate their lives to this exciting science this chapter was designed to provide you with a basic introduction to the incredible range of biotechnology topics that you will read about in this book as you will see biotechnology is a multidisciplinary science with great potential for future discoveries and many powerful applications and products in this chapter we present a brief introduction and overview of many topics that we discuss in greater detail throughout the book we begin by defining biotechnology and outlining scientific disciplines that contribute to this incredible field we highlight both historic and modern applications and describe the different types of biotechnology that you will study in this book at the end of the chapter we discuss aspects of the biotechnology workforce and skills required to work in the industry 11 what is biotechnology and what does it mean to you have you ever eaten a nonbruising apple or potato been treated with a monoclonal antibody received tissue grown from embryonic stem cells or seen a knockout mouse have you ever eaten a corn chip sour cream yogurt or cheese had a flu shot known a person with diabetes who requires injections of insulin taken a home pregnancy test used an antibiotic to treat a bacterial infection sipped a glass of wine or milk or made bread figure 11 although you may not have experienced any of the scenarios on the first list at least one of the items on the second list must be familiar to you if so you have experienced the benefits of biotechnology firsthand biotechnology is broadly defined as the science of using living organisms or the products of living organisms for human benefit or to benefit human surroundingsthat is to make a product or solve a problem remember this definition as you learn more about biotechnology we will expand and refine this definition with historical examples and modern applications from everyday life and look ahead to the future of biotechnology you would be correct in thinking that biotechnology is a relatively new discipline that is only recently getting more attention however it may surprise you to know that biotechnology involves several ancient practices as we discuss in the next section old and new approaches to biotechnology make this field one of the most rapidly changing and exciting areas of science it affects our everyday lives and will become even more important during this centurywhat some have called the century of biotechnology a brief history of biotechnology if you asked your friends and family to define biotechnology their answers might surprise you they may have no idea what biotechnology is perhaps they might speculate that biotechnology involves seriouslooking scientists in white lab coats secretively carrying out sophisticated cloning experiments in expensive laboratories when pressed for details however your friends probably will not be able to tell you how these experiments are done what information is gained from such work and how this knowledge can or cannot be used although dna cloning the genetic manipulation of organisms and even cloning entire organisms are exciting modernday techniques biotechnology is not a new science in fact many applications represent old practices with new methodologies humans have been using other biological organisms for their benefit in many processes for several thousand years historical accounts have shown that the chinese greeks romans babylonians and egyptians among many others have been involved in biotechnology since about 2000 bc biotechnology does not mean hunting and gathering animals and plants for food however the domestication of animals such as sheep and cattle for use as livestock is a classic example of biotechnology our early ancestors also took advantage of microorganisms and used fermentation to make breads cheeses yogurts and alcoholic beverages such as beer and wine these practices continue today during fermentation some strains of yeast decompose sugars to derive energy and in the process they produce ethanol alcohol as a waste product when bread dough is being made yeast such as saccharomyces cerevisiae commonly called bakers yeast is added to make the dough rise this occurs because during fermentation yeast release carbon dioxide which causes the dough to rise and creates holes in the bread alcohol produced by the yeast evaporates when the bread is cooked if you make bread or pizza dough at home you have probably added storebought s cerevisiae from an envelope or jar to your dough mix for thousands of years humans have used selective breeding as a biotechnology application to improve production of crops and livestock used for food purposes in selective breeding organisms with desirable features are purposely mated to produce offspring with the same desirable characteristics for example crossbreeding plants that produce the largest sweetest and most tender ears of corn is a good way for farmers to maximize their land to produce the most desirable crops figure 12a similar breeding techniques are used with farm animals including turkeys to breed birds producing the largest and most tender breast meat cows chickens and pigs other examples include breeding wild species of plants such as lettuces strawberries cabbage and bananas over many generations to produce modern plants that are cultivated for human consumption many of these approaches are really genetic applications of biotechnology without expensive labs sophisticated equipment phdtrained scientists and wellplanned experiments humans have been manipulating genetics for hundreds of years by selecting plants and animals with desirable characteristics humans are choosing organisms with useful genes and taking advantage of their genetic potential for human benefit as you will learn zebrafish are important experimental model organisms figure 12b scientists at the childrens hospital of boston produced a transparent zebrafish named casper casper was created by mating a zebrafish mutant that lacked reflective pigment with a zebrafish that lacked black pigment casper has also proven important for drug testing and in vivo in the living organism studies of stem cells and cancer for example to study how cancer cells spread or metastasize scientists injected fluorescent tumor cells into the fishs abdominal cavity and were able to track the migration of those cells to specific locations in the body one of the most commonly known applications of biotechnology is the use of antibiotics substances produced by microorganisms that will inhibit the growth of other microorganisms in the 1940s penicillin became widely available for medicinal use to treat bacterial infections in humans in the 1950s and 1960s advances in biochemistry and cell biology made it possible to purify large amounts of antibiotics from many different strains of bacteria batch largescale processesin which scientists can grow bacteria and other cells in large amounts and harvest useful products in large batcheswere developed to isolate commercially important molecules from microorganisms explained further in chapters 4 and 5 since the 1960s rapid development of our understanding of genetics and molecular biology has led to exciting innovations and applications in biotechnology as scientists unravelled the secrets of dna structure and function different laboratory technologies led to gene cloning the ability to identify and reproduce a gene of interest and genetic engineering manipulating the dna of an organism through genetic engineering scientists are able to combine dna from different sources this process called recombinant dna rdna technology is used to produce hundreds of recombinant proteins of medical importance including insulin human growth hormone and bloodclotting factors from its inception rdna technology has dominated many areas of biotechnology and as you will soon learn many credit rdna technology with starting modern biotechnology as an industry you will learn that rdna technology has led to hundreds of applications including the development of diseaseresistant plants food crops that produce greater yields crops engineered to be more nutritious and genetically engineered bacteria capable of degrading environmental pollutants gene cloning and rdna technology have had a tremendous impact on human health through the identification of thousands of genes involved in human genetic diseases initiated in 1990 and completed in 2003 the human genome project was the ultimate cloning project and an international research effort with goals to identify and sequence all genes contained in the dna of human cells the genome and to map gene locations to each of the 24 human chromosomes chromosomes 1 to 22 and the x and y chromosomes the human genome project has revealed the chromosomal location and sequence of every human gene from genes that control normal cellular processes and determine characteristics such as hair color eye color height and weight to the myriad of genes that cause human genetic diseases figure 13 as you will learn human genome data are now free and readily available in public databases the human genome project has significantly advanced the development of new diagnostic tools for detecting genetic diseases and molecular approaches for treating and curing human genetic diseases as a result new knowledge about human genetics is having and will have tremendous and wideranging effects on basic science and medicine now and in the near future the human genome project ushered in an exciting new era of research in molecular biology and genetics known as genomics the study of genomes including the development of extraordinary new techniques for sequencing dna these techniques have made it possible to sequence the genomes of virtually any species and have resulted in the ability to sequence individual human genomes for a variety of reasons from analyzing genetic ancestry to genetic testing and disease diagnosis you will learn about creating artificial or synthetic genomes and the plans scientists have for these genomes in addition new approaches for genome editing based on an exciting technology called crisprcas is making it possible to correct genetic diseases and create novel genetic modification of genomes in many speciesincluding humans throughout the book we extensively discuss these topics the doityourself biotechnology movement a movement under way called doityourself diy biotechnology moves biotechnology and related applications away from traditional research environments such as universities or established companies the diy movement encompasses individuals with many different backgroundsfrom new doctoral students to kitchen biologists with little formal training to amateurs with an interest in tinkering to entrepreneurs some have referred to diy participants as biohackers what diy enthusiasts share in common is that more than 90 percent work in communal space not garages or basements they are mostly under 45 years old and about 20 percent have earned a doctorate diy folks are not necessarily rogue inexperienced amateurs diy biotech is working much the way apple cofounders steve jobs and steve wozniak did when they built their first circuit boards at home in their bedrooms and garages inexpensive instruments for amplifying dna and diagnostic devices for detecting malaria have resulted from diy biotechnology however whether any diy discoveries will result that will have anywhere close to the impact of apple on technology remains to be seen some of the methods they are using are fairly routine now for example in most parts of the world you could do basic genecloning experiments in your kitchen not exactly diy but about 4 years ago a group of undergraduate students in a genome course at johns hopkins university announced they had made a synthetic version of yeast chromosome 3 incorporating only essential elements of the genome we mention this as an example of how students with relatively little training can do this work diy participants often seek crowdsource funding via online fundraising campaigns rent space seek equipment donations or share lab space with others concern has been raised about diy scientists working in unregulated ways and what may result from their research for instance german authorities discovered pathogenic antibioticresistant bacteria in a crispr kit sent from california the kit contained common gut microbes german regulators declared the environmental risk of modifying these drugresistant bacteria as insignificant but banned all such imports from the company odin except to certified highsafety laboratories that have some governmental oversight right now because there is no government funding for diy biotechnology participants can largely do whatever they want in an unregulated environment as long as their work is not illegal,biotechnology is the science of using living organisms or their products to create solutions for human needs and environmental challenges although the field has ancient originssuch as using yeast for fermentation and selective breeding of plants and animalsmodern biotechnology has greatly expanded its applications key technologies include genetic engineering modifying dna to add or enhance desired traits and recombinant dna rdna technology which allows dna from different species to be combined these innovations enable the production of critical medical proteins like insulin and growth hormones genetically modified crops with enhanced yields or resistance to disease and bacteria engineered to degrade pollutants a milestone in biotechnology was the human genome project 19902003 which mapped the complete human genome fostering new fields like genomics study of genomes and tools such as crisprcas a precise geneediting technology with potential for correcting genetic diseases recently the diy biotechnology movement has brought biotech tools into community labs and personal projects outside traditional research settings while this trend has democratized access to biotech it also raises safety concerns especially when dealing with unregulated use of powerful tools like crispr kits
biotechnology a science of many disciplines one of the many challenges you will encounter as you study biotechnology will be piecing together complex information from different scientific disciplines it is impossible to talk about biotechnology without considering important contributions of biology chemistry mathematics computer science and engineering in addition to fields such as philosophy ethics and economics biotechnology is an expansive interdisciplinary field later in this chapter we consider how biotechnology provides a wealth of employment opportunities for people who have been trained in diverse fields figure 14 provides a diagrammatic view of the many disciplines that contribute to biotechnology notice that the roots are primarily formed by work in the basic sciencesresearch into fundamental processes of living organisms at the biochemical molecular and genetic levels basic science research with the help of other disciplines can lead to genetic engineering approaches that form the core or trunk of many but not all biotechnology applications at the top of the tree biotechnology applications create products or processes to help humans or our living environment many future processes have yet to be developed and await the intuitive participation of people working in biotechnology today a simplified example of the interdisciplinary nature of biotechnology can be summarized as follows at the basic science level scientists conducting research in microbiology at a college university government agency or public or private company may discover a gene or gene product in bacteria that shows promise as an agent for treating a disease condition typically biochemical molecular and genetic techniques would be used to determine the role of this gene this process also involves using computer science in sophisticated ways to study the sequence of a gene and analyze the structure of the protein produced by the gene an example of a field called bioinformatics once basic research has arrived at a detailed understanding of this gene the gene may then be used in a variety of ways including drug development agricultural biotechnology and environmental and aquatic applications figure 14 the many applications of biotechnology will become much clearer as we cover each area at this point keep in mind the important concept that biotechnology is a science that requires skills from many disciplines products of modern biotechnology throughout the book we consider many cuttingedge and innovative products and applications of biotechnology we look not only at products for human use but also at biotechnology applications of microbiology marine biology and plant biology among other disciplines sixtyfive percent of biotechnology companies in the united states and 50 percent of the australian and german biotech companies focus on producing medicines for the treatment of human health conditions many of these medicines are recombinant proteins named because they are produced by genecloningrecombinant dna techniques for example the majority of these proteins are produced from human genes inserted into bacteria to make the recombinant proteins used to treat human disease conditions in 1982 the california biotechnology company genentech widely regarded as the worlds first biotech company received approval for recombinant insulin used for the treatment of diabetes as the first biotechnology product for human benefit figure 15 there are now several hundred drugs vaccines and diagnostics on the market with more than 350 biotechnology medicines in development targeting over 200 diseases drug development by the biotechnology industry is focused on combating major diseases that affect humans and over half of the new drugs in the development pipeline are designed to treat cancer this focus of the industry is usually evident when reviewing types of new biotech drugs approved in the united states for example 2017 was a banner year for new biotech drug approvals with 46 novel drugs approved in the united states second only to 1996 when 53 biotech drugs were approved figure 16 as shown in figure 16 cancer drugs received the most approvals in comparison 31 new drugs were approved in germany in 2017 approximately onethird of these were cancer drugs nine new cancer drugs received approval in canada and 8 in japan in the same year table 11 provides a brief list of some of the topselling biotechnology drugs and the companies that developed them diagnosis andor treatment of a variety of human diseases and disordersincluding acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids stroke diabetes and cancermake up the bulk of biotechnology products on the market many of the most widely used products of biotechnology are recombinant proteins table 12 if figure 16 and tables 11 and 12 have not provided you with convincing examples of the importance of biotechnology for human health consider that genes are being introduced increasingly into human cells as gene therapy approaches are employed in attempts to treat and cure human disease conditions gene therapy involves delivering genes to treat or cure a genetic disorder genetics and tissue engineering may lead to the ability to grow organs for transplantation that would only rarely be rejected by their recipients new biotechnology products from marine organisms are being used to treat cancers strokes and arthritis there is no question that advances in modern medicine driven by new knowledge from the human genome project and biotechnology applications will result in healthier lives and potentially increase the human life span ethics and biotechnology just as in any other type of technology the powerful applications and potential promise of biotechnology including diy experiments raise many ethical concerns and it should be no surprise to you that not everyone is a fan of biotechnology a wide range of ethical legal and social implications of biotechnology inspire great debate and discussion among scientists clergy politicians lawyers and the general public figure 17 throughout this book we present ethical legal and social issues for you to consider increasingly you will be faced with ethical issues of biotechnology that may influence you directly for instance organism cloning in mammals such as sheep cows and monkeys has led some to suggest that human cloning should be permitted how do you feel about this if in the future you and your spouse were unable to have children by any other means would you want the opportunity to create a baby by cloning a replica of yourself as another example the potential for genome editing to create embryos with desired genetic characteristics has raised many ethically challenging questions if you choose to work in biotechnology you will need to develop team working skills that allow for differences in opinion on many ethical issues necessitating an understanding of the basis for the arguments supported by some of your colleagues look for the you decide boxes in each chapter in which we present scenarios or ethical dilemmas for you to consider realize that there are pros and cons and controversial issues associated with almost every application in biotechnology our goal is not to tell you what to think but to empower you with knowledge and a framework for approaching ethical issues that you can use to make your own decisions,biotechnology is an interdisciplinary field merging biology chemistry mathematics computer science and engineering to develop solutions for human and environmental needs its roots in basic sciences like biochemistry and molecular genetics have led to major applications including the creation of recombinant proteins like insulin gene therapies and new vaccines around 65 of biotechnology companies focus on human health with many producing treatments for conditions like cancer diabetes and genetic disorders techniques such as gene cloning and tissue engineering show promise for regenerative medicine including the potential to grow organs for transplant with minimal rejection risk ethically biotechnology sparks complex debates especially around gene editing cloning and diy biotechnologies issues such as the genetic modification of embryos and the cloning of mammals raise questions about human cloning designer babies and the limits of genetic manipulation biotechnology professionals must balance these ethical concerns with the fields rapid advancements fostering a thoughtful informed approach to their work with ongoing progress biotechnology is likely to transform medicine agriculture and environmental health but it also demands careful consideration of its social and ethical impacts
12 types of biotechnology now that you have learned about the many areas of science that contribute to biotechnology you should recognize that there are many different types of biotechnology chapters 2 and 3 provide important introductions to basic concepts you will need to be familiar with to understand biotechnology in chapter 2 you will learn about basic aspects of cell structure and function dna structure genomes and related topics in chapter 3 we discuss principles of gene cloning and recombinant technology that were the foundation for creating the biotechnology industry as well as current trends in genomics that are key to understanding many modern applications of biotechnology consider this section an introduction to what you will learn in greater detail in the chapters that follow microbial biotechnology in chapter 5 we explore the many ways in which microbial biotechnology affects society as we discussed previously the use of yeast for making beer and wine is one of the oldest applications of biotechnology by manipulating microorganisms such as bacteria and yeast microbial biotechnology has created better enzymes and organisms for making many foods simplifying manufacturing and production processes and making decontamination processes for the removal of industrial waste products more efficient microbes are used to create vaccines and to clone and produce batch amounts of important recombinant proteins used in human medicine many studies are focusing on microbial genomics for a range of reasons including to help us understand the roles microbes play in human health another recent controversial aspect we will explore is the creation of synthetic genomesmanmade dna sequences that can be used to engineer microbes with desirable characteristics in microbial biotechnology you will also explore strategies used to detect microbes for diagnostic purposes in humans food samples and other sources approaches to detect and combat microbes as possible bioweapons and potential applications of microbes for producing biofuels agricultural biotechnology chapter 6 is dedicated to plant biotechnology and agricultural applications of biotechnology in ag biotech we examine a range of topics from genetically engineered pestresistant plants that do not need to be sprayed with pesticides to foods with higher protein or vitamin content and drugs developed and grown as plant products agricultural biotechnology is already a big business that is rapidly expanding the united nations food and agriculture organization has predicted that feeding a world population of 91 billion people in 2050 will require raising overall food production by some 70 percent nearly 100 percent in developing countries agricultural biotechnology has provided solutions for todays farmers in the form of plants that are more environmentally friendly while yielding more per acre resisting diseases and insect pests and reducing farmers production costs producing more for the expanding population will require new innovations from agricultural biotechnology a new generation of crops known as geneedited rather than genetically modified is coming to the market created through crisprcas editing tools that snip and tweak dna at precise locations they largely fall outside current regulations at least for now in 2016 it was announced that a group at pennsylvania state university used crisprcas to modify the common white button mushroom agaricus bisporus to produce the first geneedited crop approved for human consumption figure 18 by inactivating a gene that produces an enzyme responsible for the browning the edited mushroom has a longer shelf life and resists browning when bruised or cut the current regulations were written for the earlier generation of genetically modified organisms in which scientists used bacteria and virusestypically from plant peststo drop a payload of new genes into the nuclei of the plant cells where they merge with the plants dna that worked but scientists could not control where the new genes would be inserted and that led to worries of potentially dangerous genetic disruptions or crossbreeding with nongm crops for a long time these regulations did not adequately distinguish between conventional gm and the new geneediting techniques leaving confusion as to whether regulators will interpret products of gene editing as genetically engineered recently europes high court has declared that geneedited crops should be subject to the same regulations as conventional gm organisms animal biotechnology in chapter 7 we examine many areas of animal biotechnology one of the most rapidly changing and exciting areas of biotechnology animals can be used as bioreactors to produce important products for example goats cattle sheep and chickens are being used as sources of medically valuable proteins for human treatment such as antibodiesprotective proteins that recognize and help body cells to destroy foreign materials antibody treatments are being used to help improve immunity in patients with immune system disorders many other human therapeutic proteins produced from animals are in use yet most of these proteins are needed in quantities that exceed hundreds of kilograms to achieve this largescale production scientists can create female transgenic animals that express therapeutic proteins in their milk transgenic animals contain genes from another source for instance human genes for clotting proteins can be introduced into goats for the production of these proteins in their milk one of first examples was expressing silk genes from spiders in transgenic goats to produce silk in milk so called silk milk from which silk could be purified and used to make clothes fabrics including those for lighter and stronger military gear more recently alexion pharmaceuticals has produced a recombinant protein sebelipase alfa with the drug name kanuma that is expressed in eggs from transgenic chickens it has been approved to treat a rare fatal condition in humans lysosomal acid lipase deficiency the cayman islands government intensified its efforts to protect inhabitants from mosquitoborne diseases by releasing genetically engineered ge mosquitoes the ge mosquitoes known as friendly aedes are developed by oxitec united kingdom they contain a gene that kills the young insects at the larval stage to prevent the spread of dengue fever zika virus infection chikungunya virus infection and yellow fever ge male mosquitoes mate with wild female mosquitoes and produce unviable larvae that die before adulthood in two locations of mainland malaysia field trials involving the temporary smallscale releases of the same mosquitoes were approved by the malaysian national biosafety board the malaysian government has made impressive efforts to establish a clear regulatory framework through the biosafety act 2007 which came into effect in december 2009 and is a party to the cartagena protocol on biosafety approval processes for innovations like these is a requirement even for imminent problems like the spread of the zika virus these have been discussed in chapter 12 gene editing is not being used only with plants a minnesota company recombinetics is editing the genes of farm animals to create cattle without horns figure 19 on farms cows are typically dehorned so that they dont hurt each other with their horns a standard procedure is to burn off the horns when the cows are young but researchers are looking for a way to avoid this to genetically remove cow horns a university of californiadavis team collaborated with recombinetics to target the horngrowing gene using specific enzymes as a kind of molecular scissors this means that scientists sliced out the horngrowing gene naturally found in holsteins and replaced it with a gene that stops horns from growing in the angus breed how will this be regulated according to the current regulatory regime the fda is in charge of regulating genetically engineered animals in the us while the european food safety authority is in charge of regulating this in europe this is based on the fact that the recombinant dna construct is a new animal drug and that affects the form or function of an animal some are not advocates of this change because the hornless cows would be the first geneedited animal to be entering the food supply and the nonadvocates think it would be wise to go through a mandatory premarket approval process and test the milk to make sure it is substantially the same as milk from other holstein cows that have their horns time will decide which ethical issue prevails humane creation of hornless cattle or changes in regulations that require more testing than is currently required by regulatory agencies as yet another modern example of animal biotechnology teams in the united kingdom and the united states have been working on growing beef muscle cells in laboratory dishes to create cultured meat that can be used to make labgrown burgers see figure 110 so far the price tag for this meat is very highabout 18000 a pound compared to lean ground beef which sells for about 500 a pound however producing labgrown meat could have tremendously positive impacts considering the environmental harm caused by modern methods of running large animal farms and meat processing plants forensic biotechnology in chapter 8 we discuss forensic biotechnology dna fingerprintinga collection of methods for detecting an organisms unique dna patternis a primary tool used in forensic biotechnology forensic biotechnology is a powerful tool that allows law enforcement to examine dna evidence that can lead to the inclusion or exclusion of a person with regard to suspicion dna fingerprinting can be accomplished using trace amounts of tissue hair blood or body fluids left behind at a crime scene it was first used in 1987 to convict a rapist in england but is now routinely used to provide evidence in court cases throughout the world to convict criminals as well as to free those wrongly accused of a crime dna fingerprinting has many other applications including use in paternity cases for pinpointing a childs father identifying human remains and even dna testing of esteemed wines to certify their grapes of origin another application is the dna fingerprinting of endangered species this has already reduced poaching and led to convictions of criminals by analyzing the dna fingerprints of their catches scientists also use dna fingerprinting to track and confirm organisms that spread disease such as escherichia coli in contaminated meat and to track diseases such as aids meningitis tuberculosis lyme disease and west nile virus infection liquid biopsies for cancer detection and monitoring are becoming a big area of forensic interest figure 111 illustrates new genetic markers that can be used to detect bladder cancer guardant health exosome diagnostics and illumina have invested millions in this bloodbased analysis process the san diegobased illumina announced in 2016 that its blood tests should reach the market by 2019 and cost around 1000 or less the new testing concept is referred to as liquid biopsy the technique uses highspeed dna sequencing machines to scour a persons blood for fragments of dna released by cancer cells mit technology review reports if dna with cancercausing mutations is present it often indicates a tumor is already forming even if its too small to cause symptoms or be seen on an imaging machine the new tests will need to differentiate between mutated cells in the bloodstream caused by cancer and mutations caused by polyps or moles which can resemble tumors the tests will require fda approval but are expected to improve cancer diagnosis bioremediation in chapter 9 we discuss bioremediation the use of biotechnology to process and degrade a variety of natural and humanmade substances particularly those that contribute to environmental pollution bioremediation is being used to clean up many environmental hazards that have been caused by industrial progress one of the most publicized examples of bioremediation in action occurred in 1989 following the exxon valdez oil spill in prince william sound alaska figure 112 by stimulating the growth of oildegrading bacteria which were already present in the alaskan soil many miles of shoreline were cleaned up nearly three times faster than they would have been had chemical cleaning agents alone been used as you will learn the rapid degradation by microbes of the dispersed oil droplets from the deep water horizon spill in 2010 enabled research into natural oildegrading organisms and the enzymes that may be used to clean a future spill in this chapter we provide an overview of basic applications of bioremediation involving microbes plants and genetically engineered organisms to clean up different materials in various environmental conditions discuss advantages and challenges of bioremediation approaches and consider the possibility that energy can be derived from degrading waste among other topics,biotechnology encompasses various branches each impacting fields like medicine agriculture and environmental science key types include microbial biotechnology uses microorganisms like bacteria and yeast to improve food production manufacture vaccines and clean up industrial waste synthetic genomes allow for customdesigned microbes with useful properties agricultural biotechnology focuses on genetically modified crops for enhanced nutrition pest resistance and higher yields addressing global food demands new geneediting techniques like crispr enable precise dna modifications animal biotechnology animals serve as bioreactors for producing therapeutic proteins examples include transgenic goats producing silk proteins and geneedited cattle without horns forensic biotechnology uses dna fingerprinting in criminal investigations paternity tests and disease tracking advanced liquid biopsies detect cancer markers in blood samples bioremediation employs microbes and genetically modified organisms to break down pollutants such as oil spills highlighting biotechnologys role in environmental recovery
aquatic biotechnology in chapter 10 we explore the vast biotechnology possibilities offered by waterthe medium that covers the majority of our planet one of the oldest applications of aquatic biotechnology is aquaculture raising finfish or shellfish in controlled conditions for use as food sources aquaculture is growing in popularity throughout the world especially in countries such as israel and vietnam israel cultivates freshwater species like tilapia carp and mullet while vietnam focuses on marine fish such as cobia seabass and grouper it has been estimated that approximately 50 percent of all fish consumed by humans worldwide are produced by aquaculture in recent years a wide range of fascinating new developments in aquatic biotechnology have emerged these include the use of genetic engineering to produce diseaseresistant strains of oysters and vaccines against viruses that infect salmon and other finfish in 2015 the fda approved aquadvantage salmon as the first gm animal for human consumption as you will learn in chapter 10 these transgenic salmon overproduce growth hormone leading to extraordinary growth rates over short growing periods and thus decreasing the time and expense required to grow salmon for market sale figure 113 these salmon are among the most controversial biotechnology applications in recent years the uniqueness of many aquatic organisms is another attraction for biotechnologists in our oceans marine bacteria algae shellfish finfish and countless other organisms live under some of the harshest conditions in the world extreme cold pressure from living at great depths high salinity and other environmental constraints are hardly a barrier because aquatic organisms have adapted to their difficult environments as a result such organisms are thought to be rich and valuable sources of new genes proteins and metabolic processes that may have important human applications and benefits bioprospecting efforts are ongoing around the world to identify aquatic organisms with novel properties that may be exploited for commercial purposes for instance certain species of marine plankton and snails have been found to be rich sources of antitumor and anticancer molecules intensive research efforts are under way to better understand the wealth of potential biotechnology applications that our aquatic environments may harbor medical biotechnology in section 11 we introduced the concept that many recombinant proteins are being manufactured for human medical applications however this is just one example of medical biotechnology chapter 11 covers a wide range of different applications from detecting and diagnosing disease conditions through genetic testing and genome sequencing to innovative treatments of human disease conditions including drug development gene therapy and immunotherapy medical biotechnology has resulted in an amazing array of applications designed to improve human health over 325 million people worldwide have been helped by drugs and vaccines developed through biotechnology although many powerful applications have already been designed and are currently being applied the biotechnology century will see some of the greatest advances in medical biotechnology in history it seems as though hardly a week goes by without news of a genetic breakthrough such as the discovery of a human gene involved in a disease process television newspapers journals electronic news sources social media and popular websites all report important discoveries of new genes genomic analysis and other headlines involving dna figure 114 every day new information about human genetics is helping scientists identify defective genes and decipher the details of genetic diseases such as alzheimers and parkinsons disease sickle cell anemia taysachs disease cystic fibrosis cancer and infertility to give just a few examples the human genome project has resulted in new techniques for genetic testing to identify defective genes and genetic disorders including the ability to sequence and analyze entire genomes from individuals and we explore many of these techniques in this book gene therapy approaches in which genetic disease conditions can be treated by inserting normal genes into a patient or replacing diseased genes with normal genes are expanding at a rapid rate in chapter 11 and throughout the book you will learn about a powerful new approach called crisprcas which is transforming the way scientists can modify a genome crisprcas is a technique for genome editing that provides molecular scissors of sorts to cut out and replace a specific sequence of dna promising studies with genome editing are under way as are human trials using genome editing for gene therapy to treat diseases as you will learn applications of genome editing are also very controversial stem cell technologies continue to be among the most promising aspects of medical biotechnology but they are also among the most controversial topics in all of science stem cells are immature cells that have the potential to develop and specialize into nerve cells blood cells muscle cells and virtually any other type of cell in the body stem cells can be grown in a laboratory and when treated with different types of chemicals can be coaxed to develop into different types of human tissue that might be used in transplantation to replace damaged tissue there are many exciting potential applications for stem cells but as we discuss in the next section and in chapters 11 and 13 many complex scientific ethical and legal issues surround their use we will also explore exciting new approaches that combine gene therapy and stem cell work to harness and direct the immune system for intriguing new applications called immunotherapy to treat disease such as certain types of cancer stay tunedthis is an extraordinarily exhilarating time to be studying biotechnology biotechnology regulations an essential aspect of the biotechnology business involves the regulatory processes that govern the industry in much the same way as pharmaceutical companies must evaluate their drugs based on specific guidelines designed to maximize the safety and effectiveness of a product most biotechnology products must also be carefully examined before they are available for use biotechnology regulations extend to the international level across a range of domains including food and feed safety safe handling transfer and use of biological materials and protection of intellectual property rights these regulations are primarily overseen by international organizations such as the world health organization who and the food and agriculture organization fao in the united states the food and drug administration fda sets the standards for biotechnology products many times the us department of agriculture usda and the environmental protection agency epa are involved in fact it has been said that biotechnology is one of the most heavily regulated industries from procedures designed to ensure that biotechnology products meet strict standards for purity and performance to issues associated with granting patents and abiding by the regulatory processes required for clinical trials of biotechnology products in human patients we consider these and other international biotechnology regulatory issues in chapter 12 the biotechnology big picture although we have described different types of biotechnology as distinct disciplines do not think about biotechnology as a field with separate and unrelated disciplines it is important to remember that almost all areas of biotechnology are closely interrelated for example applications of bioremediation are heavily based on using microbes microbial biotechnology to clean up environmental conditions even medical biotechnology relies on the use of microbes to produce recombinant proteins and all branches of biotechnology are regulated a true appreciation of biotechnology involves understanding the biotechnology big picturehow biotechnology involves many different areas of science and how different types of biotechnology depend on each other this interdependence of many areas of science will be put to the test in solving important problems in the twentyfirst century a growing area of biotechnology that we do not address in a separate chapter but that exemplifies interdisciplinary science is industrial biotechnologythe application of biotechnology to industrial processes such as manufacturing one key benefit is making products quickly at reduced costs in cleaner ways that are more environmentally friendly than traditional production processes many applications of industrial biotechnology involve the production of enzymes by microbes these enzymes are used as biocatalysts to speed up chemical reactions one of the earliest most wellpublicized examples of industrial biotechnology was implemented in the 1970s to reduce water pollution problems caused by the use of phosphates in laundry detergent as we discuss in chapter 5 biotechnology companies created enzymes to remove stains from clothing instead of using phosphates for stain removal this resulted in a product that cleans clothes at lower water temperatures and at reduced energy costs while dramatically decreasing phosphaterelated algal blooms in water some believe that the potential global impact of industrial biotechnology is greater than even that of medical biotechnology and agricultural biotechnology and that it will be the next big area for innovation in biotechnology industrial biotechnology incorporates research from many different fields including genomics proteomics bioinformatics and microbial biotechnology and typically incorporates microorganisms such as bacteria yeasts and fungi in some cases natural enzymes are used in other cases new enzymes can be bioengineered with specific biocatalytic capabilities for certain industrial processes we provide an introduction to the concept of industrial biotechnology here and encourage you to think about potential applications in this field as you learn about different topics throughout your studies of biotechnology,aquatic biotechnology explores waterbased resources for biotechnology applications with aquaculture being a prime examplewhere fish like tilapia and salmon are cultivated for food genetically engineered aquadvantage salmon approved by the fda grow faster due to enhanced growth hormone production reducing time and costs for market readiness the harsh conditions in aquatic environments foster unique adaptations in marine organisms making them valuable for potential therapeutic compounds such as anticancer agents found in certain marine plankton and snails medical biotechnology advances human health through genetic testing drug development and gene therapy which includes crisprcasa precision genomeediting tool stem cell research also promises treatment options by using undifferentiated cells to replace damaged tissues although ethical debates continue around their use regulatory bodies like the fda who and usda oversee biotechnology to ensure product safety and effectiveness highlighting the industrys complexity and global impact industrial biotechnology applies microbial enzymes to industrial processes creating ecofriendly alternatives like phosphatefree detergents which reduce environmental harm overall biotechnologys interdisciplinary nature integrates fields like genomics and bioinformatics with each branchwhether in agriculture medicine or industrycontributing to advancements that tackle pressing global issues
13 what will the new biotechnology century look like an example from medical biotechnology numerous problems and challenges have the potential to be solved by biotechnology for many of the greatest challengessuch as curing lifethreatening human diseasesthe barriers to overcoming these challenges are not insurmountable answers lie in our ability to better understand biological processes and to design and adapt biotechnological solutions rather than speculating about all of the ways that biotechnology may affect society in this century an impossible task in this section we entice you with a few ideas on how medical biotechnology in particular is currently saving lives and will continue to do so in powerful ways in the years ahead as you read this example do not focus on understanding the scientific details of the scenarios we describe instead consider how each application can improve the quality of life for individuals so that you can develop a big picture view of the power of biotechnology a scenario in the future how might we benefit from the human genome project history will show that 2001 was a landmark in the biotechnology time line in february 2001 some of the worlds bestknown molecular biologists gathered at a press conference to announce the publication of the rough draft of the human genome a major accomplishment of the human genome project the dna sequenceread as the letters a g c and tof human chromosomes was almost complete identifying the chromosomal location and sequencing of all genes in the human genome has greatly increased our understanding of the complexity of human genetics basic research on the molecular biology and functions of human genes and controlling factors that regulate genes is providing immeasurable insight into how genes direct the activities of living cells how normal genes function and how defective genes are the molecular basis of many human disease conditions ultimately an advanced understanding of human genetic disease conditions is intended to provide novel cures and such information is already transforming medicine as it is currently practiced and will provide even more powerful new therapies and cures in the future a new era of medicine is on the horizon understanding the human genome is not the biological crystal ball that will immediately solve all of our medical problems a better understanding of human disease will require that we understand the structures and functions of the proteins that genes encode the proteome the collection of proteins responsible for human cells but neither the genome nor the proteome is a software program that predetermines our health and our lives unlocking the mysteries of the human genome and human proteome alone makes the twentyfirst century a most exciting time in which to be part of the scientific discovery process imagine the following scene a woman seeks advice at a local pharmacy she recently switched from one major arthritis drug to another and the current drug is not working any better than the first to alleviate her arthritis she tells her pharmacist this drug is so expensive and doesnt work any better for me than the last one but i dont want to waste it or throw it out well sometimes the drugs dont work for everyone says the pharmacist this exchange represents one difficulty inherent in most health care strategies many people currently experience the same problem that the woman at the pharmacy encountered the standard overthecounter or routinely prescribed treatments available for arthritis and a host of other medical problems rarely work in the same way for everyone some drugs work for only some patients and in others have little to no effect we use an arthritis example here but you could substitute almost any medical condition of choice does this sound familiar have you or someone you know had an experience like this with your doctor or a pharmacist how will the biotechnology century help this patient how might this conversation be different in the future genome information has and will continue to result in the rapid sensitive and early detection and diagnosis of genetic disease conditions in humans of all ages from unborn children to the elderly in arthritis we know there are different forms of this disease that have similar symptoms and genetic analysis has revealed that these different forms of arthritis are caused by these genes let us consider how identifying the genes causing arthritis in our imaginary patient might help her from its inception the human genome project yielded immediate dividends in our ability to identify and diagnose disease conditions the identification of disease genes has enabled scientists and physicians to screen for a wide range of genetic diseases through genetic testing but increasingly sequencing entire individual human genomes or personal genomics accurately and at relatively low cost although most insurance companies do not yet pay for genomic analysis is being implemented as one example of how genetic testing and personal genomics can aid in the diagnosis of genetic disease conditions these applications can use singlenucleotide polymorphisms snps pronounced snips snps are singlenucleotide changes or mutations in dna sequences that vary from individual to individual figure 115 these subtle changes represent one of the most common examples of genetic variation in humans snps are the cause of some genetic diseases such as sickle cell anemia snps associated with arthritis and many other conditions such as stroke cancer heart disease diabetes and behavioral and emotional illnesses have been discovered testing or sequencing ones dna for different snps is one way to identify the specific disease genes that a person may be carrying the discovery of snps is partially responsible for the emergence of a field called personalized or precision medicine this has also been referred to as pharmacogenomics in the past precision medicine is customized medicine one aspect of precision medicine involves tailordesigning drug therapy and treatment strategies based on the specific genetic profile of a patientthat is using his or her genetic information to determine the most effective and specific treatment approach refer to figure 118 can precision medicine help our arthritis patient we know that arthritis is a disease that shows familial inheritance for some individuals and as mentioned earlier a number of different genes are involved in different forms of arthritis in many other cases of arthritis a clear mode of inheritance is not seen there are likely additional genes or nongenetic factors such as exercise and diet that influence the severity of arthritis a simple blood test from our patient could be used to prepare dna for genetic analysis to determine which genes are involved in the form of arthritis that this woman has armed with this genetic information a physician could design a drugtreatment strategy based on the genes involvedthat would be specific and most effective against this womans type of arthritis a second woman with a different genetic profile for her particular type of arthritis might undergo a different treatment than the first and a man with arthritis must have a very different treatment strategy based on his genetic profile this is the power of precision medicine in action researchers can now study massive databases that combine genetic information medical records wearable devices and patient surveys on diet exercise and side effects these studies will result in the need for more diagnostic tools and precisionguided therapies that only biotechnology can provide much of this information will be available and provided directly to the patient through a smartphone tablet or other device and increasingly in the future such devices will be used as diagnostic tools to monitor key vital signs see figure 11b treating our arthritis patient might involve nanotechnology or applications that incorporate extremely small devices a nano scale nanotechnology is a relatively new field that has rapidly emerged as a major research area one promising application of nanotechnology related to medical biotechnology has been the development of small particles that can be used to deliver drugs to cells figure 116 for our arthritis patient these nanoparticles might deliver drugs genes rna antibodies or even immune cells to help combat arthritis in addition to advances in drug treatment gene therapy represents one of the ultimate strategies for combating genetic disease gene therapy technologies involve replacing or augmenting defective genes with normal copies of them scientists are working on a variety of ways to deliver healthy genes into humans and ways to replace defective genes including through approaches we mentioned previously such as genome editing think about the potential power of these approaches could gene therapy be used to treat or cure our arthritis patient many promising new gene therapy applications have recently emerged and you will learn about some of these in chapter 11 however many barriers must be overcome before gene therapy becomes a safe practical effective and wellestablished approach to treating many different diseases stem cell technologies are expected to provide powerful tools for treating and curing disease stem cells are immature cells that can grow and divide to produce different types of cells such as skin kidney and blood cells stem cells can be coaxed to form almost any tissue of interest depending on how they are treated cultured cells and tissues derived from stem cells are valuable for drug testing organs on a chip have been developed for most of the major organs in the body see chapter 7 and now make it possible to study drug interactions before the drugs are administered to patients or test animals imagine growing skin cells blood cells and even whole organs in the lab and using these to replace damaged tissue or failing organs such as the liver pancreas and retina figure 117 regenerative medicine is the phrase used to describe this approach in the future scientists may be able to collect stem cells from patients with genetic disorders genetically manipulate these cells by gene therapy and reinsert them into the patient from whom they were collected to help treat genetic disease conditions stem cells are already being used to treat arthritis patients but unfortunately most of these applications are highly unregulated and have not been rigorously tested by the scientific or medical communities as you will learn in chapter 11 recently a young boy with a deadly skin condition caused by a genetic disorder underwent a remarkable treatment that combined gene therapy to correct a mutation and regenerative medicine to restore healthy skin to over 80 percent of his body imagine the near future when wholegenome analysis and precision medicine including specific drug and gene therapies are routinely offered at your doctors office the future is not far away we hope that the brief examples provided in this section demonstrated how the future is indeed bright for marvelous advances in medical biotechnology and that at this early stage in your studies you look forward to learning much more about these and other applications here we have discussed basic examples of medical applications in the biotechnology century but in future chapters you will learn about exciting applications from other areas of biotechnology that will potentially change our lives for the better keep in mind that through biotechnology many seemingly impossible problems may not be so insurmountable in the future there is no better time to be part of biotechnology we conclude our introduction to the world of biotechnology by discussing career opportunities in the industry,the twentyfirst century ushers in groundbreaking advancements in medical biotechnology focusing on lifesaving applications and personalized healthcare a pivotal milestone the human genome project completed in 2001 enabled scientists to map the human genome greatly enhancing our understanding of genetics and its impact on diseases this knowledge supports precision medicine which customizes treatments based on individual genetic profiles addressing diseases like arthritis where treatment efficacy varies widely genetic testing now detects snps singlenucleotide polymorphismssmall genetic variations that can cause diseases like sickle cell anemia and influence conditions such as cancer heart disease and diabetes precision medicine leverages this data to design patientspecific drug therapies additionally nanotechnology offers promising applications in targeted drug delivery while gene therapy strives to replace or correct defective genes providing new hope for genetic disease treatment stem cell technology plays a key role in regenerative medicine as stem cells can differentiate into various tissues allowing for the potential cultivation of organs to replace damaged ones collectively these innovations foreshadow a future where personalized geneticsbased healthcare becomes the standard marking an era of tailored treatments that enhance quality of life and deliver precisiondriven effective therapies
14 the biotechnology workforce how will the world be preparing for the biotechnology century recent advances have created a range of new opportunities for biotechnology companies and individuals seeking employment in the biotechnology industry figure 118 ultimately biotechnology companies are looking for people who are comfortable analyzing complex data and sharing their expertise with others in teamoriented problemsolving work environments the biotechnology workforce depends on important contributions from talented people in many different disciplines of science the business of biotechnology in 1976 genentech inc a small company near san francisco california was founded genentech part of the roche group since 2009 is generally recognized as the first biotechnology company and its success ushered in the birth of this exciting industry with the release of recombinant human insulinoffering the first opportunity for diabetic persons to receive this protein today biotechnology is a global industry with hundreds of products on the market sales of therapeutic biological drugs biotherapeutics such as enzymes antibodies growth factors vaccines and hormones including many recombinant proteins in the united states are a significant part of this revenue annual sales of biotherapeutics are in excess of 225 billion worldwide and doubling about every 5 years many biotechnology companies are working on cures for cancer it is the first or second leading cause of death before the age of 70 years in 91 of 172 countries and it ranks third or fourth in an additional 22 countries according to a study conducted by who in 2015 over 350 biotechnology products are currently in development targeting cancers diabetes heart disease alzheimers and parkinsons diseases arthritis aids and many other diseases recombinant crops and seeds and industrial products such as biofuels are other large categories of revenue for biotechnology companies globally top regions for biotechnology jobs north america europe and japan account for approximately 95 percent of the worlds biotechnology companies but biotechnology firms are found throughout the world in more than 54 countries countries without a traditional history in research and development rd worldwide are turning to biotechnology for hightech innovations for example biotechnology is a rapidly developing industry in india and china clustering of biotechnology companies happens close to public institutions of research where basic science ideas for biotechnological applications are generated the united states continues to be a world leader in biotechnology there are currently around 700 public biotechnology companies in the united states and many other private companies when the biotechnology industry first began most companies were located in relatively small clusters or hubs in cities such as san francisco and boston while individual rankings of states can vary from year to year there are now clusters of biotechnology companies distributed across the united states the united kingdom is the leading biotech cluster in europe the country offers over 120000 biopharma jobs and it also leads europe in research funding germany has also become a toptier cluster with one of the leading biotech companies biontech collaborating with pfizer to develop mrnabased flu vaccines in 2018 france has ranked third in biopharma employment in europe according to france biotech the country offers around 20000 biotech jobs the netherlands continues to compete with the big players in the biotech industry a lot of multinational companies like johnson johnson and glaxosmithkline have chosen the netherlands for their global operations european countries like spain switzerland belgium italy and denmark have also emerged as biotechnology hubs see figure 119 we offer this perspective on the distribution of biotech clusters to emphasize that biotechnology employment opportunities are available across the world and are not restricted to just a few areas so if you want to work in the biotechnology industry you can find job opportunities almost anywhere visit the biotech careers website listed on the companion website to find biotechnology companies located around the world and to learn about their current products and career opportunities what is a biotechnology company by now you may be wondering what is the difference between a biotechnology company and a pharmaceutical company most people can name pharmaceutical companies such as merck johnson johnson or pfizer because they or a family member may have used one or more of their products but most people cannot name a biotechnology company table 13 or explain why a biotech company is different from a pharmaceutical company the large pharmaceutical companies are commonly referred to as big pharma generally speaking pharmaceutical companies are involved in drug development by chemically synthesizing or purifying compounds used to make the drugproducts such as aspirin antacids and cold medicines pharmaceutical companies typically do not use living organisms to grow or produce a product such as a recombinant protein as is the focus of biotechnology companies but for the past few decades the distinctions between the two industries are blurred because many large pharmaceutical companies are often involved in biotechnologyrelated research and product development either directly or indirectly by partnering with a biotechnology company also remember that biotechnology involves much more than drug development there are many different companies of varying sizes dedicated to working on specific areas of biotechnology biotechnology companies vary in size from small companies of less than 50 employees to large companies with over 300 employees historically many biotechnology companies began as small startup companies formed by a small team of scientists who believe that they might have a promising product to make such as a recombinant protein to treat disease the team must typically then seek investors to fund their company so that they can buy or rent lab facilities buy equipment and supplies and continue the research and development necessary to make their product but starting a biotechnology company is risky business on average a lot of startup companies close without providing any return to investors biotechnology startup companies rely on financial investments or capital in the company such as venture capital vc funds provided at an early stage to startup companies with a potential for success sources of vc funds can be individuals endowments foundations financial institutions and other companies for example venture capital funds make money by owning equity in startup companies that have a promising technology to develop angel investorsaffluent individuals who provide capital for a startup in exchange for company ownershipare key to providing startup biotechnology companies with the funds needed to carry out the research and testing necessary to make a product vc investments are the essential pipeline of funds that supports biotech companies during the economic downturn in 2008 as biotechnology vc investments experienced a 46 percent decrease between 2007 and 2008 many biotechnology companies had only enough cash flow for 12 months or less but since this time fundraising for biotechnology companies has rebounded fairly well bolstered by many new innovative products such as biotherapeutics new gene therapies and immunotherapies that are showing strong potential for treating patients ultimately most investors in a biotechnology company do so with an expectation that there will be some return on their investment and they will make a profit if the company is successful eventually if a startup biotechnology company is successful in bringing a product to the market a process that takes around 10 years on average at a cost in the united states of over 2 billion for a medical drug many startups are often bought by larger wellestablished companies bringing a promising product close to market ultimately creates value for a company which may enable it to file for an initial public offering ipo which means that it is available for the public to purchase shares of company stock for example as biotech company funding rebounded after 2008 in 2013 24 companies in the united states offered ipos stocks in these companies rose by an average of 20 percent on the first day of trading generating approximately 18 billion for the biotechnology industry there are similarities between how pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies are organized figure 120 in figure 120 we provide a basic organizational structure for a typical mediumsize biotechnology company for your reference to help you appreciate the range of operations and the variety of employees involved in a successful company beyond just research and development we discuss many aspects of this in the next section in which we describe different job opportunities in each area of a biotechnology company,the biotechnology industry is poised for significant growth creating diverse job opportunities for individuals adept at analyzing complex data and collaborating in teambased environments it began in 1976 with genentech which launched recombinant insulin paving the way for the industrys expansion into biotherapeutics including vaccines enzymes and hormones this sector is vital for addressing major health challenges with over 350 products in development targeting diseases like cancer diabetes and alzheimers biotechnology companies are predominantly located in north america europe and japan yet emerging hubs are found in countries like china and india where innovation thrives despite less historical emphasis on research and development unlike traditional pharmaceutical firms that primarily focus on chemical synthesis biotechnology companies utilize living organisms to create products thereby broadening the scope of health care and agriculture most biotech startups rely on venture capital or angel investors to fund research and development with many later being acquired by larger corporations once they bring successful products to market a typical biotechnology company features a multidepartmental structure that includes research regulatory clinical and production teams underscoring the collaborative nature required for successful product development
a brief history of ornamental horticulture it is easier to define and distinguish the crops and crafts of ornamental horticulture from the rest of horticulture than to separate the historical antecedents of ornamental horticulture from those of pomology forestry and vegetable production several factors account for the difficulty of assigning specific dates to the horticultural time line for ornamentals foremost among these factors is the changing way people have used and regarded many of the plants of horticulture over time todays flowering specimen trees were commonly more prized for their fruit in centuries past even their importance as food suffered inconsistencies for example peaches were once as important for hog feed as for peach brandy today certain cultivated varieties of peaches may be used for the landscape value of their flowers with their fruit regarded as little more than a maintenance nuisance olive trees have undergone a similar change of purpose in landscape use the development of ornamental horticulture has accompanied the evolution of a worldwide system of agriculture but it has not paralleled that development agriculture reaches back to primitive cultures and to the cultivation of edible plants that began when the reliable availability of wild game waned the biblical garden of eden is not possible to date but its influence in ornamental horticulture has been great several western cultures have set the garden of eden as an ideal standard to strive toward in the development of their gardens eastern cultures have similar romanticized ideals of the garden as a spiritual paradise and those ideals have frequently influenced the design of their earthly landscapes aside from the religionbased garden influences there are documented records of gardens as far back as the ancient egyptians and sumerians over 5000 years ago irrigation made arid lands productive and the selective production of preferred plants began although food provision was undoubtedly the major purpose of these ancient gardens the egyptians were among the earliest civilizations to cultivate plants for their aesthetic values their interest in plants as sources of spices fragrant oils and fibers eventually progressed to the development of formal gardens around the homes of the affluent for centuries the egyptians refined their techniques of horticulture production their pictorial and written documentation of the plants important to them throughout their thirtyfive centuries of cultural dominance comprise a great legacy that will keep scientists and historians busy for years as human society evolved and advances were made in agricultural technology those civilizations that were attentive to the stewardship of their land tended to last longer than those such as ancient greece which flourished brilliantly but briefly on the calendar of mankind after the egyptians it was not until the era of the ancient romans about 2500 years ago that ornamental horticulture was again recognized as having value in the lives of people the romans were the photocopy society of history borrowing extensively from the agricultural and horticultural knowledge of egypt and greece however to their credit they refined and improved the techniques and proved themselves to be much better stewards of their land than the greeks whose culture they supplanted it was the romans who introduced grafting and budding as common propagative techniques ancient rome exemplified what many would regard as a regrettable accompaniment to the appreciation and advancement of ornamental horticulture as a result of its total cultural dominance of the known world its unchallenged military might its enslavement of weaker societies and its supreme selfassurance romes wealthy citizens were free to practice civility at the highest levels they built gracious villas at the center of large farms directly adjoining the villas were large gardens that extended the spaciousness of the indoors to the outside those villa gardens were usually walled to permit greater control of the growing environment and the development of the owners fantasies formal patterns water features sculpture flower plantings pruned shrubbery and carefully planned paving patterns created outdoor rooms whose primary purposes were visual enjoyment and leisure time pleasure had rome not fallen it is interesting to wonder how the history of ornamental horticulture would be written today but decline and fall it did with the demise of rome western civilization plunged into the dark ages surviving only fragmentally in the small protected gardens of monasteries scattered across europe ornamental horticulture did not return to favor until the renaissance which began in italy in the sixteenth century the gardens of the italians of that century were joyous rediscoveries of their rich roman ancestry whose ruins were literally strewn at their feet once again confident of their power to exercise control over their environment italians of the sixteenth century built large formal gardens that were as remarkable for their engineering as for their aesthetics the technology of the time allowed the italians to transform their steep hillsides into broad terraces for pleasurable human activity lavish water displays resulted from the redirection of rivers and streams into and out of the gardens with the sculpture of heathen rome still abundant former marbleized deities assumed new roles as novel ornaments in the gardens of christian italy in the seventeenth century france continued the tradition of lavish formal garden development on a scale even larger and grander than that of the italians as the lead player on the stage of western civilization france during the reigns of the louises affirmed again that gardens and ornamental horticulture paralleled the growth of military prowess power and wealth more than the improvement of agricultural technology while many less fortunate citizens of france were barely subsisting the great formal garden master andre lenotre was creating living works of art at versailles and other sites throughout france his apprentices spread throughout europe attempting to bring the gardens of very other country into compliance with the formal baroque tradition of france while the french gardens were seemingly simplesymmetrical balance walk intersections marked by a fountain or piece of sculpture plants sheared into sculptural shapes topiary and a design most intricate and complex near the building becoming less intense as it advanced toward the surrounding countrysidefew were able to match the genius of lenotre also not every garden site could duplicate the vast flatness of france where the gardens could cover hundreds of square miles and create the desired impression of limitless luxury and extravagance england in the eighteenth century brazenly rejected the belief that landscapes must be formalized and display the heavy hand of man in order to qualify as a garden with a court life less formal than that of the french and a more freewilled aristocracy england was receptive to the influences of men like william kent lancelot capability brown and humphrey repton who believed formality to be antinature the english naturalism style gained such popularity throughout the british isles that centuriesold formal gardens were swept away to be replaced with grassy landscapes whose groupings of trees carefully shaped lakes serpentine streams distant views of grazing sheep fabricated grottoes and manufactured ruins atop distant hillsides fit their designers ideas of how a romantic edenlike paradise landscape should appear nowhere was a straight formal line sheared plant or splashing fountain to be seen yet these naturalistic gardens were just as contrived as their formal continental predecessors observing these gardens today many wonder what was so special about them they are so parklike and so evocative of a drive through the open countryside it is easy to forget that at the time of their development they were as extraordinary as was the horseless carriage at the start of the industrial revolution the other great contribution of the english in the history of ornamental horticulture was their role as plant collectors their fondness for plants is almost genetic as they moved back and forth across the civilized and notsocivilized world english explorers took andor collected plants with them in addition they wrote about the plants they collected and even preserved pressed samples of them much to the benefit of later botanists and taxonomists they established great botanic gardens for the propagation study and public display of their plant bounty collected from the far reaches of the empire also though the english did not invent greenhouses the orangeries of the aristocracy planted the benefits of indoor plant production into our historic consciousness concurrent with the evolution of ornamental horticulture in europe but separated both geographically and attitudinally were the gardens of asia first the chinese then the koreans and later the japanese used plants within and surrounding their homes in ways that most westerners can never fully comprehend closely tied to their buddhist and shinto faiths oriental asians perceived themselves as being a part of the natural world not separate from and dominant over it in their cities crowded even centuries ago as they are today gardens were small by comparison to europes the gardens were walled and within their confines the orientals developed gardens that ranged from lush and green the buddhist paradise gardens to stark and minimal the zen gardens plants were pruned and trained to represent their larger counterparts outside the walls in more abstract uses plants represented mountains clouds islands and other nonplant elements of the natural world the intent was to represent the larger notsoperfect natural world in scaleddown perfect form shinto gardeners frequently believed that certain unusual plants possessed spirits or the souls of departed friends or relatives or important persons as such those plants were regarded with special reverence unlike the formal gardens of europe which were intended as a grand stage for the display and glorification of the human players with plants subjugated to a minor role the gardens of the orient were designed to feature plants and other elements of the natural world in a way that provoked an intellectual thoughtfulness by the visitors in many cases a walk through an oriental garden was a psychodrama intended to remind even the most aristocratic asians of their natural place in the world if any one thing stands out as a landmark along the historic progression of ornamental horticulture it is the discovery of the new world the americans were a rich repository of plants already being cultivated for both food and ornamental purposes by indian cultures long before the invasion by european explorers began once underway the exploration and settlement of the new world promoted largescale transplantation of foreign plant species and plant products between europe and the americas as the various nations of europe sought to stake their territorial claims in the new world numerous colonies were established in the lands that years later would become the united states the seventeenth century saw the spanish the dutch and the english heavily committed to the colonization of the coastal areas of north america while indigo tobacco timber rice and other economic crops were of far greater importance to the settlers they still found room in their lives to value and grow ornamentals the new england puritans established cottage gardens to produce flowering plants that scented their houses spiced their cooking and decorated their celebrations the dutch discovered and sent back to holland the bulbs that would later establish their international preeminence as bulb purveyors to the world for much of the next century even as the early colonists were replaced by sons and daughters who sought and eventually seized their independence from their european homelands american gardens and uses of ornamental plants were copies of old world ideas twentyfirst century tourists visiting historic williamsburg virginia see eighteenthcentury formal gardens everywhere savannah georgia is a picturesque city built to a european ideal of public squares at the center of residential clusters the great estates of george washingtons mount vernon and thomas jeffersons monticello were profoundly influential in americas perception of ornamental horticulture due largely to the godlike esteem that both men enjoyed from their contemporary countrymen and the admiring millions who have followed both estates were a combination of farm and english naturalistic garden spectacularly sited mount vernon and monticello represented their owners responsible stewardship of their lands and their willingness to try new agricultural techniques while neither estate made lavish uses of flowers their shade tree plantings and expansive lawn areas were reminiscent of the designs of kent and brown in england as the postrevolution nation grew stronger economically the favorable climate and tobacco cotton economy of the southeast fostered a lifestyle and garden culture that were aristocratic and formalized bowling greens elizabethan flower gardens and serpentine walks lined with graceful shade trees typified the gardens of early america in the south it is tempting to seek similarities between the selfconfident slave laborcentered plantation lifestyle of the precivil war southern united states and that of the ancient romans wherein both societies found time to cultivate their appreciation of ornamental plants under similar circumstances as the nation pressed its boundaries westward through the visionary efforts of jefferson lewis and clark and others the vegetation of the prairies and the fertile soil of the american midwest were added to the american treasure chest of resources far away at the western edge of the continent spanish settlers were building missions throughout the land that would become california mission plantings were generally typified by orchard groves vineyards kitchen gardens and small flower plantings as the spanish mexican influence took root in southwestern north america it laid the foundation for a garden design legacy that reaches back to the fourteenth century yet is still viable today the moorish gardens that were prevalent in southern spain in that early time were typically walled and paved and closely related to the buildings they adjoined they often used water features for their psychological cooling effect and the term spanish patio came to define a distinctive type of outdoor area development six centuries later that garden style is still popular particularly around the adobe and missionlike architecture of california new mexico and arizona,ornamental horticulture focused on cultivating plants for beauty has evolved distinctly from agriculture which primarily targets food production the practice dates back to ancient egypt where gardens were created not only for utility but also for aesthetics and spirituality inspired by concepts like the garden of eden roman society further advanced ornamental horticulture with formal garden designs and innovative techniques like grafting integrating gardens into daily life as spaces for leisure and visual enjoyment after romes fall ornamental gardening declined until the renaissance in italy which revived it through grand formal gardens engineered with terraces sculptures and water features in 17thcentury france gardens at versailles and other sites showcased baroque aesthetics marked by symmetry and vastness led by designer andre lenotre england later introduced naturalistic landscapes creating edeninspired gardens that harmonized with the environment in asia horticulture integrated spiritual philosophies exemplified by zen gardens which emphasized simplicity and natures balance with the colonization of the new world ornamental plants were cultivated by settlers influenced by european styles and later incorporated spanishmexican designs such as patios with cooling water features especially in the southwestern us thus ornamental horticulture reflects a diverse culturally rich history shaped by aesthetics spirituality and technological advancements
the history of ornamental horticulture in america is as difficult to chart on a time line as is its history worldwide perceptions of the role of plants change over time exploration and discovery of new species continue nevertheless certain individuals places and events are worthy of note even at the risk of omitting others of comparable merit dutch settlers brought bowling greens to america these set the precedent for our village greens city parks and athletic fields botanic gardens featuring all types of horticultural plants were first established in colonial america in the 18th century and facilitated the exchange of plant species between the country and the city and between the old world and the new one of the earliest and most famous botanic gardens was that of john bertram of pennsylvania established in 1728 greenhouses were also being built in america originally as orangeries for citrus fruits prior to the revolution in appearance and construction materials used they were far cruder and darker structures than those of today nurseries although not unknown elsewhere in the country were most important in western new york around rochester both fruit trees and ornamentals were grown and shipped to all parts of the nation and the world for at least half of the 19th century rochester reigned as the center of nursery production in america commercial seed houses and the mail order seed businesses began in the mid1800s further diversifying the regional floras of america jacob bigelow a boston physician and botanist took responsibility for the development of the mount auburn cemetery in massachusetts about 1817 it was done in the naturalistic style of eighteenthcentury england and set a new national standard for burial grounds so widespread was the enthusiasm for naturalistic cemeteries and their inclusion of a wide variety of trees and shrubs that the best ones became comparable to botanic gardens these cemetery grounds also whetted the american appetite for more numerous and more naturalistic city parks frederick law olmstead regarded as the father of landscape architecture in america drew on the designs of the english naturalists to win the competition for the design of new york citys central park the first great city park in america he and his partner calvert vaux built city parks throughout the eastern united states and firmly established the democratic concept of public landscaping for all citizens not just the wealthy and powerful late in the 19th century the lawnmower was technically improved to the point that lawns could be kept trimmed in a manner similar to today prior to that scythes andor grazing animals were the means of controlling turf height pierre du pont of the pennsylvania du ponts established what is arguably americas premier horticultural display garden over a fortyfive year period beginning in 1906 now open to the public in kennett square pennsylvania longwood gardens is an americanized eclectic interpretation of sixteenthcentury italian renaissance seventeenthcentury french baroque and eighteenthcentury english naturalism the publication of rachel carsons book silent spring in 1962 moved agriculture in general and ornamental horticulture in particular in a direction that never concerned the early growers and garden builders silent spring was the first significant alarm sounded to warn of the dangers of overusing chemical pesticides miss carsons reputation as a marine biologist and writer served her well in garnering support for her cause and helping her to weather the storm of criticism leveled against her by the chemical companies awareness of the longterm dangers of pesticides was heightened at both the individual and the governmental levels of society and over the next several decades many changes were enacted to rein in their unrestricted use today thanks to rachel carson and many other environmental advocates the control of insect disease and weed pests is increasingly in the hands of trained professionals who use chemicals knowledgeably and with restraint biological controls and integrated pest management are the new means of controlling pests most of the highly toxic and longlasting materials of the past are now out of production what few remain are only available to certified trained professionals who know how to use them safely and with minimal impact on the environment public acceptance of the environmental ethic that threads through modern horticulture has also encouraged industry practitioners to seek new and safer ways of bringing their products and services to the marketplace naturalized plantings have found acceptance where high maintenance plantings would have been in the past golf courses are beginning to manage their nonplay areas as wildlife habitat regions within their properties reduction of irrigated areas and careful monitoring of fertilizer applications to assure that it stays on site are common practices on many courses now consumers are being educated to accept greenhouse and nursery products with superficial flaws when those flaws have nothing to do with the quality or use of the plant or product ornamental horticulture in the united states is not as much a state of being as it is a state of becoming as americas ethnic heritage expands from a majority of euroamericans to include more asian americans african americans hispanic americans and other immigrant groups it is predictable that the uses and appreciation of ornamental plants will continue to evolve that is probably as it should be one can only wonder how this foreword will be written when the fifth edition is published,the history of ornamental horticulture in america reflects evolving plant uses and societal values early influences included dutch settlers who introduced bowling greens and botanic gardens like john bertrams which facilitated plant exchanges with europe in the 18th century greenhouses or orangeries were built for citrus while rochester ny became a nursery hub distributing ornamental plants nationwide public landscapes gained prominence with mount auburn cemeterys naturalistic design and frederick law olmsteads democratic city parks epitomized by new yorks central park technological advancements like the lawnmower reshaped lawn maintenance rachel carsons silent spring 1962 spurred awareness on pesticide impacts leading to safer pest management practices today environmental ethics in horticulture prioritize sustainable practices including integrated pest management and reduced irrigation as americas demographics shift ornamental horticulture is poised to continue evolving with diverse cultural influences
the value of plants in our lives americans live within a culture of superlativesthe tallest building fastest automobile most populous city costliest motion picture and so on always seeking an event or superhero to top all others we look farther and farther into space probe deeper into the oceans and contrive an endless array of mechanical gadgetry yet within sight of us all at nearly all times are marvels of nature whose simple existence allows our survival and whose wonders are taken for granted although only partially understood green plants produce and recycle the oxygen on which animal life depends they capture the energy of the sun and convert it into forms usable by humans and other animals plants are the only living organisms capable of manufacturing their own food surely if only one plant existed on the entire earth it would rank as the foremost wonder of the world an oxygen and food factory fortunately for us the plant kingdom dominates the biological world and gives generously to us while asking only for a pollutionfree environment and suitable habitat in return in addition to their principle services of energy conversion food manufacture and oxygen production through the process known as photosynthesis plants offer us food products medicines fermenting agents lumber dyes clothing lubricants fuel flowers fragrances shade glorious autumn colors vines to swing on and challenges to climb plants are synonymous with natural landscapes they nurture us physically as well as psychologically they inspire us refresh us and regenerate our lives plant classification and the natural world although this text is not intended to replace a more thorough study of botany the fullest appreciation of plants results from a basic understanding of their place in the natural world for centuries beginning with a greek named theophrastus in about 300 bc scientists have attempted to classify the planets organisms into a tidy system that accommodates all current knowledge of the natural world and allows new knowledge to be added as long as the new knowledge fit the criteria of the existing classification system new knowledge was easily accepted thus the organisms of the world were once classified into two kingdoms plants and animals if an organism moved had a nervous system and could not make its own food it was classified as an animal if it was anything else it was classified as a plant early classification systems focused on those living organisms that were easily seen because of their size macroscopic causing the classification to be based more on physical appearance than on natural factors the development of the microscope and the ongoing expansion of knowledge of our world have allowed the worlds organisms to be classified in a more natural way there are now five known kingdoms based on the structure of the organisms cells which kingdom includes which organisms is determined by criteria such as the organisms size complexity of development methods of reproduction and how it captures nutrient energy if the organism is only onecell in size such as bacteria it is termed a prokaryote these simple organisms have been around for roughly two billion years reproducing asexually and account for a large portion of earths past and current biomass prokaryotes are so primitive that they do not encase their genetic material dna in a nucleus instead containing it within an area termed the nucleoid region which is enclosed by a membranous cell wall prokaryotes are able to move with the aid of whiplike appendages termed flagella singularflagellum if an organisms cell is more complex greater in size and volume and containing its dna within a nucleus then it is termed a eukaryote while eukaryotes may include singlecelled organisms they also include the fungi animals and plants eukaryotes are more recently evolved than prokaryotes having been around only about one and a half billion years they reproduce sexually thereby allowing more genetic combinations to occur in turn that allowed multicellular organisms to evolve so to understand where plants fit into the grand scheme of nature begin by knowing them to be eukaryotes based on their cell structure their method of reproduction whether they do or do not capture their own nutrient energy and other criteria the organisms of the natural world are classified into five kingdoms 1 protistamostly onecelled prokaryotes the bacteria and bluegreen algae 2 protoctistaaquatic eukaryotic microorganisms exclusive of the fungi animals and plants 3 funginonmotile eukaryotes possessing a cell wall they reproduce by spores and derive their nutrition and energy from other living or nonliving hosts 4 animalsmotile eukaryotes lacking cell walls they derive their nutrition and energy from other living and nonliving hosts 5 plantsnonmotile eukaryotes that have cell walls they derive their energy through photosynthesis the plant kingdom the study of plant classification is termed taxonomy plant scientists who engage in the study are known as taxonomists while not all taxonomists agree completely on how to classify every plant in the world they do agree that the classification of plants must be a natural system that is based on the genetic and evolutionary relationship among plants in turn that system must be sufficiently flexible and dynamic to accommodate the continuing and evolving knowledge of plant life currently the plant kingdom is divided into divisions classes orders families genera and species the system is arranged in a hierarchal manner from any point in the classification the groups of plants share increasingly more genetic and anatomical similarities as their placement progresses down the system from division toward species while eleven of the twelve divisions of the plant kingdom contain important plants such as the algae diatoms stoneworts and mosses it is the higher plants including the ornamentals which are of relevance to this text they are classified in the division tracheophyta plants in this division are collectively termed the vascular plants meaning that they are able to move water nutrients and the products synthesized in the leaves through internal conducting tissues the xylem and the phloem some of the vascular plants such as ferns reproduce from spores reproductive cells while the majority of the higher plants reproduce from seeds coniferous plants such as pines are placed in the class coniferopsida signifying that their seeds are produced in either a cone such as a pine cone or in a berrylike formation such as a yew conifers do not flower and their leaves are needlelike scalelike or awllike the flowering plants are placed in the class angiospermopsida they are the most evolved members of the plant kingdom producing their seeds inside a fruit that developed as a swollen ovary from a fertilized flower within the class are two orders defined by the number of seed leaves cotyledons contained in their seeds monocots in the order monocotyledoneae have a single seed leaf grains and grasses are classified as monocots so are ornamentals such as palms iris lilies and orchids dicots in the subclass dicotyledoneae are angiosperms that have two seed leaves in their seeds most of the flowering plants including the fruits vegetables and ornamentals are dicots as the classification system progresses from broad generalities to more detailed specificity the genetic makeup and physical attributes of the plants contained within each family genus and species become increasingly similar the categories in increasing order of specificity are kingdom division class order family genus species eventually every plant in nature that has been identified and classified can be identified by its inclusion in these categories plant nomenclature nomenclature is the naming of plants the name that identifies one plant and distinguishes it from the hundreds of thousands of others in the world is its botanical name the botanical name is expressed in latin and is recognized internationally plant taxonomists governed by the international rules of botanical nomenclature assign the names based on where a plant fits within the kingdoms classification system the unique botanical name given to a plant is in two parts termed a latin binomial the first part is taken from the genus in which it is classified the second part is called the epithet and the two parts together identify the species while a genus name may be applied to several closely related types of plants such as pinus the pines or cornus the dogwoods the epithet eliminates all other types but one and creates the unique species thus pinus sylvestris pinus resinosa pinus nigra and pinus strobus are distinctly different plants as are cornus florida and cornus mas it is not uncommon for plants to have two names the botanical name and a common name by which it is known within a country or region of a country examples are euonymus alatus which some know as winged euonymus and others as burning bush and acer saccharum known as sugar maple to most americans but as hard rock maple in parts of new england as familiar as they are common names can be misleading and are not wisely used when there is a need to be specific about a plant as examples the douglas fir is not a fir neither is the white cedar a cedar as unique as the latin binomial is in identifying a plant the nuances of nature and the artificially induced differences created by horticulturists and plant breeders often require additional words to fully describe a specific plant the genus and epithet names of a plant may be followed by a variety or cultivar cultivated variety name though there are additional subclassifications such as subspecies and form it is usually enough to know just the varieties and cultivars of a species to be certain of their identity varieties are plants within a single species that are distinctively different from others of the species they are capable of breeding true to form and owe their variance to natural origins the thornless honeylocust exemplifies a true variety differing from other honeylocusts by its lack of prickly thorns its botanical name is properly written as gleditsia triacanthos var inermis the var identifies it as a variety of the species it is not italicized unlike the genus epithet and variety names as an example here is how the tree with the common name thornless honeylocust would be classified by taxonomists kingdom plantae division tracheophyta class angiospermopsida order rosales family leguminosae genus gleditsia species triacanthos variety inermis cultivars are varieties that are selected and sustained by people who value some distinctive attribute of the plant and propagate it in large numbers usually by vegetative means were that propagation to cease the cultivar would soon disappear some cultivars are patented by the person who first discovers it the plant patent gives that person exclusive rights to propagate and sell the cultivar to greenhouses and nurseries and others who wish to grow it patented cultivars often cost more than nonpatented varieties correctly written a cultivars botanical name appears as either viburnum opulus cv sterile or viburnum opulus sterile note where italics are and are not used when two different species within one genus are successfully crossbred the resulting species is a hybrid of the two the name of the new species retains the name of the genus but drops the epithets of the two parent plants and is given a single new epithet its status as a hybrid is represented by an x for example epimedium x youngianum common name youngs barrenwort,plants play a vital role in sustaining life and enriching human experiences green plants generate oxygen and store solar energy creating the foundation for animal survival remarkably they alone manufacture their own food through photosynthesis making them essential to all ecosystems besides producing oxygen and food plants provide humans with materials like lumber dyes clothing fuel and even medicines additionally they impact mental wellbeing by beautifying spaces offering shade and creating natural landscapes that inspire and rejuvenate in taxonomy plants are classified by genetics and evolutionary relationships grouped into hierarchies from kingdoms to species the plant kingdom falls under five major kingdoms classified based on criteria like cellular complexity and nutrient processing most plants known as vascular plants belong to the division tracheophyta which includes both nonseed ferns and seed plants like flowering plants and conifers naming plants or botanical nomenclature uses a latin binomial system with genus and species names ensuring unique identification across regions some species also have varieties or cultivars carefully maintained by horticulturists for desirable traits plant taxonomy continues to evolve aligning with new scientific insights
parts of a plant the most logical starting point for a scientific study of ornamental plants is their macroscopic anatomy what we can see with the unaided eye members of the higher plants are made up of roots stems leaves and flowers or cones figure 11 flowers are the reproductive structures of the angiospermopsida as cones are for the coniferopsida as previously noted these two classes are commonly referred to simply as the flowering plants and the conifers roots roots are the belowground portion of the plant they may be fibrous with a network of roots reaching out horizontally and vertically through the soil or they may be tap roots in which one central root grows larger and is more dominant than the others in both types of root systems the larger roots are supplemented by many smaller root hairs figure 12 the principal function of the roots is to absorb water and mineral nutrients from the soil much of the absorption occurs through the root hairs in addition the roots serve to anchor the plant against toppling by wind and rain roots also store food materials produced in the leaves specialized roots called adventitious roots develop from stems in some plants such as philodendron and from leaves and cut stems of various plants being propagated vegetatively figure 13 when plants are young as when they are newly germinated from seeds the surface area of the roots is greater than the surface area of the leaves allowing for a greater uptake of mineral nutrients and water than is matched by the photosynthetic activity of the undeveloped leaves this imbalance is only temporary though and can eventually tip the opposite way once the leaves expand fully and maximize their food manufacturing capability through photosynthesis it is generally desirable to maintain a close balance between the ability of a plant to photosynthesize and the root surface area needed to take up the necessary water and minerals roots grow almost continuously throughout the life of a plant their rate of growth can be affected by environmental conditions in the soil such as temperature or moisture extremes most root systems will display greater lateral growth than depth in sites where the soil composition is extremely hard downward penetration even by tap rooted species may be limited stems stems are the central axis of plants they are usually above ground and may be long or short single or multiple and herbaceous or woody these terms are defined later in the chapter the principal functions of a stem are to conduct water and minerals absorbed by the roots to the leaves and other aboveground plant parts and to conduct food materials produced in the leaves to the roots and other plant parts leaves leaves may be thin or flat thick or fleshy broad or needlelike they are appendages of the stem and are the major food manufacturers of the plant leaves contain a green pigment chlorophyll which allows them to use the energy in light to convert carbon dioxide and water into food and oxygen this process is called photosynthesis cones or flowers cones are the reproductive structures of the conifers such as pines spruce and firs cones contain naked unenclosed seeds on the upper surface of each cone scale the conifers are slightly more primitive in evolutionary development than the flowering plants flowers epitomize the peak of evolutionary development in plants and make the flowering plants dominant in the plant kingdom they are reproductive structures that produce seeds enclosed in fruit because the varying anatomical features of their flowers are one means of identifying plants a knowledge of flower parts and types of flowers is necessary for horticulturists a complete flower is one that possesses all the floral organs sepals petals stamens and pistils figure 14 an incomplete flower lacks one or more of these organs in addition to being complete or incomplete flowers may be perfect or imperfect a perfect flower has both stamens male reproductive organs and pistils female reproductive organs an imperfect flower lacks one or the other imperfect flowers may be termed pistillate or staminate depending on which of the two essential organs they possess if both pistillate and staminate flowers occur on the same plant it is said to be monoecious if the two imperfect flowers occur on separate plants the plants are termed dioecious willows and hollies are examples of dioecious ornamental plants flowers may be produced as single blossoms such as roses or lilies figure 15 in clusters inflorescences such as gladioli or snapdragons figure 16 or as composite flowers such as chrysanthemums figure 17 composite flowers give the appearance of a single blossom but are actually a grouping of many tiny flowers,higher plants consist of four main parts roots stems leaves and reproductive structures flowers or cones roots roots anchor the plant in the soil absorb water and nutrients and store food they can be fibrous networked or taprooted dominant central root tiny root hairs increase absorption roots grow throughout the plants life and their growth depends on environmental factors like soil moisture and temperature stems acting as the plants central axis stems transport water and nutrients from the roots to the leaves and food from the leaves to other plant parts stems vary in length number and woodiness and are usually above ground leaves leaves the main food producers contain chlorophyll enabling photosynthesis to convert co and water into food and oxygen leaf structures vary including broad needlelike or fleshy forms flowers or cones cones found in conifers hold unenclosed seeds flowers found in angiosperms produce seeds within fruits flowers may be complete having sepals petals stamens and pistils or incomplete and can be perfect both stamens and pistils or imperfect plants with both male and female flowers on one plant are monoecious while those with separate male and female plants are dioecious flowers can appear singly in clusters or as composite flowers
the structure of plant parts all living organisms except viruses have the cell as their basic structural unit a single plant part such as a leaf may be composed of millions of cells the cells of plants may range in size from 125000 of an inch to nearly 410 of an inch plant cells can best be visualized as threedimensional chambers which when joined together are responsible for the shape size appearance and function of all the earths plants plants grow from seeds to maturity by the enlargement of existing cells and the production of new ones all plant cells are basically alike figure 18 nevertheless leaves do not look like stems and roots and flowers are equally different some parts of the plant photosynthesize and other parts do not some parts are rigid like stems and other parts are pliable like leaves as cells group together they become differentiated in their functions large groups of similar cells carrying on the same function are termed tissues groups of tissues make up the organs of plants figures 19 110 and 111 from the diagrams several facts should be noted the cell tiny though they are plant cells are not hollow like empty boxes each cell is comprised of a variety of components and each component has a vital role to play in the growth reproduction and differentiation of the cell figure 18 the cell wall is the foremost distinction between plant and animal cells since animal cells lack walls usually multilayered the cell wall has a primary wall on the outside a secondary wall on the inside and a cementing agent between them termed the middle lamella the wall is composed of a matrix of carbohydrates reinforced by cellulose molecules arranged in long rodlike structures as cells age they acquire deposits of lignin complex polymers within the carbohydrate matrix the result is hardening of the cells which explains why plants become woody or stiffer as they grow and age the protoplast is the living matter of the cell the nucleus is the vessel in the cell that contains the chromosomes the nucleolus and the nucleoplasm the chromosomes carry the genes that direct heredity the nucleolus is the site of ribosome production and the nucleoplasm supports it all contain the chlorophyll pigment which is vital to chloroplasts photosynthesis is all of the living material in the cell other than the cytoplasm nucleus cytoplasm nucleus the protoplast the vacuole is a cavity within the cytoplasm it is lined with a membrane and filled with salts various pigments and organic materials that are collectively termed the cell sap the plasma membrane surrounds the protoplast like a thin plastic bag separating it from the cell wall the membrane is semipermeable and controls what substances pass into and out of the cell connect the protoplasts of adjacent cells cytoplasmic strands making the living material of the cells continuous within the plant are specialized regions of the plant cell in which mitochondria respiration occurs they are enclosed by a double membrane the innermost of which is folded like an accordion that increases the surface area in which the chemical reactions of respiration can occur although most plant cells contain the same components they do not all serve the same function some remain simple embryonic and primarily divide and create new cells permitting the plant to grow meristematic cells are such cells they are concentrated at the tips of shoots and roots in most plants which explains why those plants grow from their extreme ends their apical meristems not their bases an obvious exception is the grasses which grow at the base not at the tips of their blades grassy monocots have their meristems located at their base a convenient property that allows mowing without cutting off the growth cells meristems also occur in other parts of the plant defined by their location for example axillary meristem in the axils of leaves and basal meristems at the base or crown of a plant they enable the plant to grow in places other than just the shoot other cells although originating from the meristematic cells assume other roles in the plant as a result of their differentiation parenchyma cells are specialized cells comprising the cortex and pith tissues in stems and the spongy mesophyll tissue in leaves most present in leaves flowers and fruits these cells allow the plant to heal its wounds secrete and excrete materials and store food they are also the site of photosynthesis within the plant where they contain chloroplasts collenchyma cells are also specialized to provide plants the structural strength they need for support their cell walls are unevenly thick permitting flexibility of the plants stems sclerenchyma cells have the thickest walls and are also involved in structural support of the plant when the cells assume the shape of long slender fibers sclerenchyma cells can also assume assorted other globular shapes termed sclerids enmassed sclerid cells form the hardest plant features such as the pits in cherries and peaches stems the transport of water nutrients and food materials between leaves and roots occurs in the vascular bundles the bundles constitute a system that reaches from the roots to the leaves running in both directions water and mineral nutrients that enter the roots are carried upward to the leaves and other aboveground parts in the xylem the xylem extends to all parts of the plant it also offers structural support to plants especially the woody trees and shrubs as parts of the xylem mature the tissue becomes nonliving further contributing to the structural strength of the plant the products resulting from the photosynthetic activity of the leaves are moved downward for storage in the roots and other tissues of the plant those products move in the part of the vascular system termed the phloem like the xylem the phloem also contributes to the structural support of the plant while it remains a living system the tissue breaks down as it ages and is replaced by new tissue although likened to a hollow pipe the phloem is actually a linkage of elongated specialized cells sieve elements that conduct the food produced during photosynthesis to other parts of the plant there are two types of stems defined by how their vascular tissues are arranged monocotyledons monocots are plants that have one cotyledon seed leaf while dicotyledons dicots have two cotyledons figure 110 illustrates how the stems of monocots and dicots differ in the arrangement of their vascular bundles stems increase in diameter due to the activity of the cambium tissue that produces the xylem and phloem because the stem is the major pipeline connecting the roots to the rest of the plant it is logical that it serves as the site for the initiation of leaves and buds the node is the location on a stem where a bud is initiated the buds may develop into leaves or flowers some buds contain both leaves and flowers the space between nodes is termed the internode a further discussion of the location of buds as a means of identifying certain plants is included in chapter 2 some stems dont look like stems at all instead they function mainly as food storage structures in the form of corms bulbs tubers rhizomes and stolons many familiar flowers grasses and vegetables have these unusual stem types leaves where the vascular tissues extend into leaves they form a network of veins the pattern of the veins venation is important in the classification and identification of many plants gaseous exchange between the air outside the plant and the intercellular spaces inside the plant occurs through pores termed stomata or stomates singular stomate the plant loses water vapor through the stomata when they are open that water loss is known as transpiration when the stomata are closed transpiration is reduced figure 19 the upper and lower epidermis are covered by a waxy cuticle not shown which keeps the leaf basically impermeable to water and helps some plants retain internal moisture leaf color plant color in general and leaf color in particular results from the presence of pigments within the cells in the majority of higher plants including the ornamentals chlorophyll is the pigment in greatest abundance that is why most living nondormant plants appear green other pigments are present in plants however xanthophyll bright yellow carotene orange and anthocyanins red are pigments that occasionally dominate in plants such as the coleus or in the blossoms of most plants but they usually await the aging of the leaf and the loss of the chlorophyll pigment to reveal their presence roots the root elongates in the region of the apical meristem that is the region where the cells are most actively dividing the apical meristem is protected by the root cap as the root presses through the soil as important as the apical meristematic region is to the growth of roots it is not the area of the most rapid water and nutrient absorption rather it is in the area of the root hairs where the fastest absorption occurs very little water or nutrient absorption occurs at the tips of roots or in older roots it is the root hairs that number in the thousands and are only a cell in thickness that amplify the absorbing surface area of a plants root system figure 111 seeds the gymnosperms and angiosperms are seedbearing plants a seed is a miniature plant it develops through the sexual reproduction process and is initially dormant it awaits the provision of proper environmental conditions that permit it to germinate the miniature plant is termed an embryo it is enclosed by a seed coat if it has two cotyledons or by a pericarp if it has only one cotyledon as noted previously plants that produce one or two cotyledons are termed monocots or dicots respectively cotyledons supply nutrients to the embryo until it can begin photosynthesizing to allow its further development,plant structures consist of complex specialized cells grouped into tissues which form the plants organs roots stems leaves and reproductive parts cell structure and function cell wall a defining feature of plant cells composed of cellulose and lignin providing rigidity and support protoplast the living part of the cell including the nucleus and cytoplasm nucleus contains genetic material and regulates cell activities chloroplasts organelles containing chlorophyll essential for photosynthesis vacuole stores water pigments and nutrients contributes to cell turgor plasma membrane semipermeable layer controlling substance flow mitochondria sites of cellular respiration meristematic and specialized cells meristematic cells divide for growth found at shoot and root tips apical meristems parenchyma involved in photosynthesis storage and healing found in leaves stems and roots collenchyma and sclerenchyma provide structural support with sclerenchyma forming the toughest plant parts organs and their functions roots absorb waternutrients via root hairs store food and anchor plants growth occurs at the apical meristem stems transport water xylem and nutrients phloem and support leaves and buds includes nodes leafbud initiation points and internodes leaves sites of photosynthesis with veins vascular bundles and stomata for gas exchange pigments like chlorophyll carotene and anthocyanins give color reproductive parts seeds from gymnosperms and angiosperms contain an embryo and cotyledons for nutrient supply until photosynthesis begins
juvenility and maturity in plants although maturation is most commonly associated with animal aging or human emotional development it also finds its place in plant science most commonly observed as a morphological structural change in the plant it can also be manifested as a change in flowering or fruiting habit or in its mode of growth juvenility is a state of vegetative growth during which a plant cannot flower in annual plants this state is very short perhaps a month or two whereas in longerlived species a healthy actively growing plant may exist in the juvenile stage for years maturity is the state of growth during which the plant becomes capable of flowering localized meristematic growth makes it possible for some plants to produce juvenile cell growth and mature cell growth simultaneously while the unseen changes that must necessarily occur in the plant to initiate its change of state from juvenile to adult are still not entirely understood the physical evidence of change is often striking english ivy hedera helix in its juvenile state is a trailing vine with deeply lobed leaves many people do not recognize it at maturity because the leaves become unlobed entire and the plant easily supports itself for upright growth philodendron leaves have an opposite appearance that is unlobed when juvenile and lobed when mature oak trees quercus species retain their dead leaves through much of the winter as long as the tree is in its juvenile state old oaks drop their leaves much earlier major plant processes a green plant is comparable to a machine that operates nonstop however unlike a machine that would perform a single function or programmed series of functions the plant machine performs different functions simultaneously at different times and under varying environmental conditions certain plant processes increase and others decrease the physiological functional processes of the higher plants are numerous but three stand out photosynthesis respiration and transpiration photosynthesis photosynthesis has been referred to earlier it is a process unique to green plants in which food sugar is manufactured from water and carbon dioxide in the presence of chlorophyll light energy from the sun or other sources drives the chemical reaction and oxygen is released in the process water used in the process is also produced the chemical equation for photosynthesis is believed to be chloroplast 6co2 12h2o 6h12o6 6o2 6h2o light energy this equation is more of a summary than a specific explanation photosynthesis is an assemblage of many reactions that scientists continually strive to understand considering that photosynthesis is the source of all fuel and all food on the planet the need to understand the process is apparent the reactions occur in the chloroplasts of the cells where the chlorophyll is contained the importance of the green pigment chlorophyll cannot be overstated it is the primary means by which the unusable energy of the sun is transformed into usable chemical energy chlorophyll is a complex molecule which is not surprising considering its almost magical accomplishment it occurs in several modified forms chlorophyll a b c d and e the modifications are based on which form of the chlorophyll molecule absorbs which wavelength of light since the light coming from the sun contains varied wavelengths figure 112 chlorophyll a is found in all photosynthetic plants absorbing nearly all of its light energy from the violet blue redorange and red wavelengths chlorophyll b absorbs more light energy from the green wavelength the absorption of the light energy triggers the chemical reaction that is photosynthesis while there are other modified forms of chlorophyll it is the a and b forms of the pigment that account for most photosynthetic activity within the cellular chloroplasts of living higher plants photosynthesis occurs in two stages sometimes called the light and dark phases and sometimes referred to as the light dependent process and the light independent process it is not the purpose of this brief treatise to explain in detail the physiology of photosynthesis suffice it to say that some of the reactions occurring during photosynthesis require light since it is through those reactions that light energy is captured and water is broken apart into hydrogen and oxygen the oxygen is released in gaseous form the hydrogen is then used in the formation of sugars by combination with an acid derived from co2 this part of the photosynthetic process does not require light hence the name dark phase the rate of the process varies with the light intensity temperature and concentration of carbon dioxide in the plants atmosphere also excessive accumulation of the end product sugar can slow the reaction respiration respiration is the process that permits living cells to obtain energy from organic material usually glucose sugar it is a breakingdown process unlike photosynthesis which is a manufacturing process respiration uses oxygen and enzyme catalysts to oxidize the sugar to carbon dioxide and water in the process energy is produced the reaction can be stated as follows enzymes glucose oxygen carbon dioxide water energy this process converts the chemical energy captured through photosynthesis into a form of energy available to the plant for growth reproduction and cell maintenance the process does not create energy but simply changes its form while photosynthesis can only occur during the hours of daylight or under artificial light and only in cells that contain chlorophyll respiration is ongoing every hour of the day and in the mitochondria of every cell of the plant energy is released as adenosine triphosphate commonly termed atp since photosynthesis produces the products needed for respiration and since photosynthesis occurs for fewer hours each day than does respiration a balance is needed that balance is made possible by the greater efficiency of the photosynthetic process in a healthy plant the reaction rate of photosynthesis is higher than that of respiration thereby producing more food during the day than can be transformed by respiration during the dark hours that permits plants to store food in the form of fruits and seeds if conditions alter the balance and permit respiration to exceed photosynthesis the plant will suffer and decline transpiration transpiration is the loss of water in vapor form from a plant water enters the plant through the roots and saturates the intercellular spaces throughout the plant then because the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere is nearly always less than the amount of water vapor inside the plant tissue the vapor leaves the plant most transpiration occur through the stomata 90 percent of which are located on the lower surface of the leaves smaller amounts of water vapor are lost through the cuticle when water uptake exceeds the rate of transpiration water passes out of the plant in liquid form through leaf openings called hydathodes this slow exudation of liquid water is called guttation transpiration rates are accelerated by increased temperatures or light as the humidity in the air around the plant increases or decreases the rate of transpiration decreases or increases in response everyone has observed wilted plants most have probably also observed that the majority of plants will recover when water is added to the soil however sometimes the plant is so extremely dehydrated that the addition of water cannot reverse the wilting still other times the soil is moist yet the plant wilts only to recover later in the day when the sun goes down each observation exemplifies a different type of wilting but all are related to the process of transpiration when the soil begins to dry out plants may transpire water faster than the roots can absorb the diminishing water resource the resultant wilting will be temporary as long as water is added before permanent injury occurs when there is ample water in the soil yet the plant is still wilted the condition is incipient meaning that transpiration is occurring faster than water can be absorbed by the roots the condition usually results when the environment of the plant is either excessively warm or bright or both as evening comes and environmental conditions moderate the wilting subsides as water absorption catches up with transpiration if there is so little water in the soil that the plant cannot replace the water vapor it has lost even after transpiration slows then the plant is in a state of permanent wilting and cannot recover even if water is added to the soil translocation translocation is the movement of organic materials from one part of the plant to another part occurring in the phloem translocation allows the products of photosynthesis to move to where they are needed for plant growth and reproduction or to be stored to become fruits and seeds depending on the stage of plant development translocation can occur in any direction within the plant,juvenility and maturity in plants juvenility is the initial phase of vegetative growth in plants when they cannot flower it is brief in annuals but can last years in longlived plants maturity however is the stage where plants gain the ability to flower and reproduce some plants like english ivy exhibit marked physical changes between juvenile and mature forms including differences in leaf shape major plant processes photosynthesis in chloroplasts plants convert sunlight water and co into glucose and oxygen chlorophyll pigments especially chlorophyll a and b capture light energy the process has two phases the lightdependent phase produces oxygen while the lightindependent phase forms sugars respiration occurring in mitochondria respiration converts glucose and oxygen into co water and atp energy essential for growth and maintenance this process balances photosynthesis to store food during the day transpiration plants lose water vapor mostly through stomata impacting nutrient transport and temperature regulation wilting may occur when water loss exceeds absorption translocation phloem transports photosynthesis products to growing or storage areas supporting plant growth and reproduction
what plants need for growth plants can and do exist under incredibly adverse environmental conditions they survive in the arctic as well as the desert they live atop mountains and in the depth of canyons they survive on land and in fresh and salt water the production of ornamental plants requires more than helping plants survive however it requires maximizing their rate of growth their quality or both the growth potential of a plant is determined by two things its genetic heritage and the environment in which it develops its genetic heritage is predetermined there is nothing a grower can do to change it its environment on the other hand is under the growers control to some extent environmental factors play a significant role in how quickly if ever the plant reaches its maximum size when it blooms how large its leaves become whether it sets fruit and many other qualitative factors a plants environment exists both above and below ground it consists of the soil and the air and those natural elements common to them bothwater and gases soil the soil is the environment of the root zone it provides the mineral elements needed by plants for use during photosynthesis it also collects and supplies water for uptake by the plants to function most effectively the soil must be porous with sufficient space between the soil particles to store air and water it must be loose enough to allow roots to grow through it yet supportive enough to stabilize the plant not all the mineral elements in soil are essential for plant growth likewise not all the elements essential for plant growth are present in necessary amounts in all soils altogether seventeen elements are essential at some time during each plants life for optimum growth these elements are basically the same for all plant species the elements are categorized as macronutrients and micronutrients depending on the quantities needed by the plant designation as a macro or micronutrient is not a measure of importance since all are essential for growth mineral nutrients are discussed in more detail in chapter 3 when soil is less than ideal for optimum plant growth it is usually the result of 1 a deficiency of essential elements especially nitrogen phosphorus and potassium used in greatest amounts by plants 2 poor aeration too little air space between soil particles 3 improper drainage either too little or too much changing the soil environment is one way to improve plant growth for example fertilizer can add missing nutrients and sand or peat moss can improve aeration or drainage atmosphere the atmosphere surrounds the aboveground portion of the plant it supplies the carbon dioxide needed for photosynthesis and the oxygen needed for respiration in closed environments such as greenhouses the addition of carbon dioxide to the air has the effect of increasing the rate of photosynthesis in certain ornamental plants such as roses and carnations the addition of gaseous pollutants to the atmosphere can have a harmful effect on plants it may harm their physical appearance and may reduce their rate of photosynthesis water water is essential to all life for plants to grow they need water for photosynthesis water also carries various essential elements within the plant water in liquid form enters the plant through the roots water as air vapor also plays a role since the humidity of the air around the plant influences the rate of transpiration the greater the humidity the more slowly will the plant transpire the presence or absence of water and the natural high or low humidity of a region influence not only the rate but also the nature of plant growth figures 113 and 114 the leafy lush growth of a rain forest contrasts sharply with the sparse stark plants of a desert epidermal thickness type of root system and population numbers are all influenced by the presence or absence of water light light is the energy that permits the existence of life on earth as previously explained it is through plant photosynthesis that the light energy of the sun is captured and transformed by plants into a form of chemical energy that is usable initially by plants for their own growth and later for growth of animals that eat the plants plants respond to light whether it is natural or artificially produced however there is a certain minimal amount of light that must be present to initiate the chemical reactions of photosynthesis it is termed the threshold value and can be provided by either a natural or artificial light source if the quantity of light is adequate for growth and distributed evenly as it falls across the plants growth will be generally straight and uniform however if the location of the light source provides more light to one side of a plant than to the other side the plant will likely respond by bending and growing toward the light source the general term for the growth of a plant in response to a stimulus is tropism when light intensity is the stimulus the applicable term to describe the bending growth is phototropism while it is natural to think that a plant stretching toward the light favors the light the explanation is chemical not a case of partiality plants produce a growth stimulant known as an auxin that is located in the tips of shoots and is responsible for cell elongation auxins will build up in a greater amount on the side of a shoot that is away from the light source creating a greater stimulant for the elongation of cells on that side of the shoot that enables the shoot to grow faster on that side thereby causing it to appear to be leaning or growing toward the light figure 115 when most of the shoots on a plant display the response it creates a rather dramatic effect often making the plant look lopsided or windswept once a shoot becomes woody it does not respond to phototropism except at its growing tip another influence of light is photoperiodism it is the response of plants to the number of hours of daylight each day the number of hours of darkness each day interruptions of the light period responses by plants to the proportionate number of hours of daylight and darkness are diverse they include flowering stem length the formation of storage organs such as bulbs and tubers leaf color change and leaf drop abscission in many plants light has a dramatic ability to initiate or delay the blooming some plants such as the roseofsharon hibiscus syriacus will flower only when day length is sufficient to reach or exceed a critical day length such species are termed longday plants the actual number of hours of light per day varies among species but without the requisite number of long days the plants will remain in a vegetative state and not initiate flower formation conversely certain species known as shortday plants will flower only after exposure to day lengths that are shorter or no longer than their critical day length chrysanthemums and poinsettias exemplify shortday plants a third group of plants known as the day neutral plants do not have their ability to initiate flowers linked to a critical day length while some species may produce more or fewer flowers in response to long or short photoperiods the plant will flower regardless of the length of illumination in the natural world the length of daylight illumination is controlled by the seasons leaves dont change color in early summer when days are long neither do leaves fall from the trees in the lengthening days of springtime when nature begins to lengthen the night hours the trees respond with color changes and eventually falling leaves garden mums grow lush and green during the long days of summer and only start to display their blossoms when the shorter days of autumn begin in commercial plant production knowledge of the critical day length of the ornamentals being grown permits the grower to promote or delay flower production of crops by manipulating the environment of the greenhouse or other production facility temperature the temperature of the plants growing environment both in the soil and in the air around it controls key reactions responsible for seed germination respiration transpiration flowering leaf abscission color change dormancy shoot and root growth and ultimately the survival of the plant temperatures explain in large part why palm trees wont survive outside in alaska and why apple trees are not planted in florida because the growth processes of plants are the result of chemical reactions temperature can accelerate slow or render impossible those reactions when the presence or absence of light is factored into the reaction many plants grow better in alternating day and night temperatures than they do in a constant temperature setting thermoperiodicity is the term applied to this positive reaction by plants to differences in the day and night temperatures of the production environment many plants commonly grown as commercial greenhouse crops respond to differential production temperatures carnations grow best at a day temperature of 65f and a night temperature of 50 to 55f in contrast chrysanthemums produced in a greenhouse prefer a warmer growing environment both day and night the positive response to specific temperature ranges has created a categorization of many plants as cool season crops or warm season crops even turf grass species vary throughout the country with the umbrellaterms of cool season grasses and warm season grasses used to describe when they will be most effective as landscape components knowledge of the relationship between the rate of plant growth and the influence of temperatures on that rate of growth permits growers to manipulate the time when a crop will be ready for sale customers do not buy poinsettias after christmas or easter lilies on the day after easter neither will they buy them too far in advance so the ability to control the flowering response of the plants by raising or lowering day andor night temperatures can determine if and when a crop is ready for harvest in other crops temperature manipulation can also make the difference between a compact full plant and a spindly sparse one the chief danger of an introductory chapter such as this one is oversimplification a discussion of the botanical sciences in so few pages may create the impression that the green plant is like a tinker toy simplistic in form and easy to understand nothing could be more incorrect the green plant is a marvel of biological and evolutionary engineering about which much is still unknown any student of ornamental horticulture should first be a student of botany,plants have evolved to thrive in diverse often extreme environments from arctic tundras to deserts however for ornamental plants maximizing growth and quality is key growth potential is influenced by genetics and environmental factors with the latter being somewhat controllable by growers soil essential for supporting roots supplying water and providing minerals for photosynthesis ideal soil is porous ensuring good aeration drainage and space for roots fertilizers can remedy deficiencies in nitrogen phosphorus or potassium atmosphere provides carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and oxygen for respiration enclosed environments may enhance growth by adding co though pollutants can harm plants and reduce photosynthesis water vital for photosynthesis and nutrient transport liquid water enters through roots while humidity influences transpiration different water levels shape plant features as seen in lush rainforests vs sparse deserts light essential for photosynthesis plants grow toward light phototropism aided by growth hormones like auxin photoperiodism response to daylight length affects flowering in species like chrysanthemums shortday and hibiscus longday temperature impacts all growth processes many plants prefer varied daynight temperatures thermoperiodicity for optimal growth controlled temperatures help time crop maturity crucial in commercial growing
description based on temperature tolerance when describing or categorizing plants based on their ability to tolerate and survive the temperature extremes of the place where they are growing horticulturists commonly refer to the plants as hardy or tender it would be illogical to select a plant for outdoor production or use if it was intolerant of the local temperatures while the plant might flourish during the summer it might die during the winter in other instances it might survive in vegetative form but never set fruit or reproduce because of overly warm temperatures the united states department of agriculture usda has prepared and periodically updates a hardiness zone map figure 22 that shows the average annual minimum temperatures of the 50 states and much of canada and mexico it divides the continent into 11 hardiness zones on the most detailed maps every county within the 48 adjacent mainland states is shown along with its hardiness zone rating each hardiness zone has an average annual minimum winter temperature variation of 10 degrees fahrenheit as the hardiness zone numbers increase the temperature minimum warms for example northern kansas temperatures zone 5 drop to between 10 and 20 degrees f in the winter but southern kansas zone 6 drops only to between 0 and 10 degrees f during the same months zones 1 and 11 represent the coldest and warmest regions of the country and are the least common zones within the united states on color coded and detailed hardiness zone maps zones 2 through 10 are further divided into a and b zones the a zone represents the coldest half of the 10degree variance and the b zone represents the warmest half of the 10degree variance note the a and b zones do not show on the map in this text when plants are described on the basis of temperature tolerance they are identified by their hardiness zone rating for example in addition to one of the descriptive categories listed earlier the plant might be described as a zone 6 evergreen or a zone 4 perennial a plants hardiness zone rating indicates that the plant may survive the winter in that zone or in zones with a higher numbered rating thus a tree or shrub rated as a zone 6 plant may survive the winters in zones 6 through 11 but not in zones 5 through 1 however there are also upper temperature limits to a plants hardiness certain plants cannot survive or grow normally in climates that are too warm that is why for example there are no apple trees in the florida keys still other plants can have unreliable hardiness zone ratings when grown in microclimate areas regions with atypical growing conditions for example some plants will survive the winter because they are buried each year under a protective snow cover where they escape the severe cold and drying winds that would otherwise kill them if a winter fails to provide the protective snow cover the plants would be unable to survive heat zone considerations though hardiness zone ratings for plants have been studied and adjusted for many years in response to the earths natural climate changes only recently has research into the impact of excessive warmth on plant growth been initiated in the mid90s the american horticultural society began the development of data that tracked the number of days that various regions of the united states experienced temperatures higher than 86 degrees fahrenheit 30 degrees celsius termed a heat day it represents the point at which a plant will begin to experience physiological injury because of the temperature using a countyspecific map similar to the usda hardiness zone map the ahs has divided the nation into 12 heat zones with zone 1 having no heat days and zone 12 averaging 210 heat days plants can then be described not only on the basis of the coldest hardiness zone in which they will survive but the warmest heat zone that they can tolerate without injury a few texts on heat zone gardening are beginning to appear and their number is predicted to increase in the next few years an increasing number of plants especially herbaceous species are coded for their heat tolerances giving recognition to the role that heat plays in plant survival a plant that has been rated for both cold hardiness and heat tolerance will be given four numbers for example the plant might be identified by its name followed by a 47 and 121 the first two numbers identify the cold hardiness zones in which it will survive zones 4 through 7 and the second two numbers indicate that it is heat tolerant in zones 12 through 1 however ratings for cold and heat tolerances will always be generalizations so it is wise to avoid selecting plants that are at the limits of their tolerance range hardiness zone maps may be purchased from the usda and heat zone maps are available from the american horticultural society through their website at httpwww ahsorg also available for purchase from the ahs is their paperback book the ahs great plant guide that assigns hardiness zone ratings to more than 3000 plants how plants are identified the groupings just listed are especially helpful for narrowing the choices when plants are being selected to serve a function play a role or solve a problem there still remains the need to identify plants specifically for example to recognize the difference between red oaks and live oaks or between zinnias and dahlias or to recognize deciduous plants by their winter twigs after leaves flowers fruit or other helpful features are gone there are several kinds of identification the simplest and at the same time the most complex is identification through recognition often built on a lifetime of association and familiarity if someone asked how you identify your best friends it might be difficult to describe the mental process behind the recognition the combination of body build facial features hair and eye color manner of walking voice pattern and more all identify a certain individual having a mental picture of that friend then allows us to take only one feature such as the voice on the telephone and reconstruct the total person in our minds eye similar identification becomes possible with plants after repeated exposure to the same species how the plants were first learned is forgotten and the ability to recognize those plants in nearly all situations becomes a part of our permanent learning another less precise kind of identification occurs when a plant species is recognized as belonging to a group but the exact species name is not known for example you may know its a spruce but not know which spruce such a level of identification serves many professional horticulturists who have no particular need for precision the exact basis for the ability to recognize at least the genus of the plant may be as lost in memory as that described earlier finally there is the kind in which the horticulturist has absolutely no idea what the plant is and must begin a methodical process of identification through searching and gradual elimination knowing that in all probability the plant has been identified classified named and entered into the scientific literature offers some comfort when faced with the identification of an unknown even then it seems like a monumental task trying to identify one plant from among the thousands and thousands of species on the earth sometimes there are shortcuts for instance if the plant is known to be a broadleaved evergreen or a flowering woody shrub or a cactus you can go to specialized texts in which a description or photo may be found perhaps someone from the state university or the local county agent can identify the plant such questions can be directed to them with clear conscience but it is still no substitute for knowing how to find out yourself the tracing of unknown plants especially the economically important ornamentals requires the use of a dichotomous analytical key there are hundreds of such keys some dealing with a limited group of plants others more encompassing all present the searcher with a series of couplets and pursue identification through a process of elimination each couplet consists of two contrasting statements the searcher chooses the statement that best describes the unknown plant beneath that statement will be another couplet again requiring the selection of one and elimination of the other the process continues until all species have been rejected except the one to which the plant belongs these keys are based in large part on physical features of the plant rather than physiological or evolutionary relationships very complex and inclusive keys such as the one published in 1949 by liberty hyde bailey manual of cultivated plants most commonly grown in the continental united states and canada revised edition macmillan new york often require information unknown to the searcher for example the couplets may require the choice between flowers with five petals or multiples of five and flowers with six petals or multiples of six if the unknown plant has no flowers attached the tracing can get off track very easily for the beginner it is best to begin with a simpler key consider the following simplistic example to understand how keys work only genera the plural of genus are being identified 1 plant evergreen 2 leaves needlelike 3 needles separate 4 needles stiff and sharp four sided spruce picea 4 needles flat with two white lines on underside hemlock tsuga 3 needles grouped in fascicles pine pinus 2 leaves broad and flat 5 leaves oval in shape not spiny 6 flowers large compound and showy rhododendron 6 flowers small fascicled and belllike andromeda pieris 5 leaves hollylike and spiny oregongrape mahonia 1 plant deciduous keys are seldom this simple but at least the concept of dichotomous couplets can be appreciated,plants are classified based on their tolerance to extreme temperatures specifically by their ability to withstand cold and heat hardy plants tolerate colder climates while tender plants are less resilient to frost and may only thrive in warmer temperatures the usda hardiness zone map is widely used in north america to categorize plants into 11 zones each representing a range of annual minimum temperatures these zones are further divided into a and b subzones indicating variations within a 10degree temperature range in addition the ahs heat zone map was developed to rate plant tolerance to high temperatures focusing on days exceeding 86f 30c which can cause physiological damage in some plants together these classifications allow growers to identify plants that will survive both the coldest and warmest parts of the year providing a range of zones eg zone 47 heat zone 121 where a plant will thrive plants are identified using several methods such as recognition from familiarity grouping into broader families like spruce or pine or using a dichotomous key which is a systematic tool with paired statements to guide the user toward the correct plant species
visual descriptions of plants since keys rely heavily on physical features of plants as the basis for separation a trained horticulturist must have a working knowledge of the terms used to describe plants such terminology is the stuff of which dichotomous keys are made leaves a leaf is described in terms of its shape its margin the presence or lack of lobes its base the patterns of its veins its apex style whether it is simple or compound and whether it is smoothsurfaced or pubescent covered with fine epidermal hairs figures 23 to 29 twigs a branch or twig is described on the basis of the type of buds it possesses the nature of its terminal bud the arrangement of its buds and leaves the shape of its leaf petiole scars prominence of its lenticel and stipule scars and the type of pith it produces figures 210 to 213 flowers the parts of a flower were illustrated and discussed in chapter 1 in addition to the flower parts already described plant keys may identify plants by the type of flower formed flowers may be described by the position of the ovary in relation to the flower parts figure 214 a hypogynous flower has a superior ovary which means that the ovary is attached to the stem above the place where the other flower parts are attached a perigynous flower also has a superior ovary but the petals and sepals are fused to form a tubelike structure around but separate from the ovary an epigynous flower has an inferior ovary or one that is attached to the stem below where the other flower parts are attached there is a floral tube but it is united with the wall of the ovary flowers may also be described as singular one flower per stem as with a tulip composite multiple small ray and disc flowers as with the sunflower or an inflorescence clusters of small flowers arranged on an axis as with snapdragons or viburnums figure 215 fruits a fruit is the ripened ovary of the flower generally as a fruit develops the ovary enlarges beyond the size seen in a fresh flower before pollination since there are different types of flowers it follows that there are also varying kinds of fruits fruits are categorized into four major groups 1 simple fruit develops from a single ovary 2 aggregate fruit develops from a single flower having a group of ovaries 3 multiple fruit develops from multiple ovaries of multiple flowers borne on a single stalk 4 accessory fruit develops from one or more ovaries and includes the calyx andor receptacle some of the fruit types are more common to ornamental plants than other types however a complete understanding of fruit types is preferable to a partial one the simple fruits are described by the mature appearance of the ovary wall the pericarp depending on the particular fruit type the pericarp may be further divided into three separate layers 1 exocarp outer layer 2 mesocarp 3 endocarp inner layer the three layers are easily recognized in the drupes or pit fruits exemplified by plums and peaches the thin outer skin is the exocarp the fleshy part of the fruit is the mesocarp and the hard pit is the endocarp so distinctive are the many fruits formed by plants that keys exist that depend solely on the fruits as the basis for the separation figure 216 the assimilation of terminology by now the assimilation of terminology may be weighing heavily on you rather than being put off by all of the new words regard them as a new language as an expansion of your existing knowledge like any new words they are best learned and understood through repeated use obtaining a good plant key and a supply of unknown plants then identifying one from the other is the best means of learning the many terms what begins as memorization can become permanent knowledge if approached properly summary the systematic classification of plants is termed taxonomy taxonomy provides each plant in nature with a binomial scientific name composed of the genus and species to which it belongs while many plants have common names as well the scientific binomial identifies the plant worldwide in addition to their botanical classification plants are commonly grouped into assorted other categories based on their physical appearance rather than their genetic relationships for example plants may be categorized as woody or herbaceous evergreen deciduous or semievergreen trees shrubs vines or groundcovers annuals perennials or biennials hardy or tender nursery or greenhouse crops bedding or foliage plants native exotic or naturalized aquatic specimen or accent wildflowers endangered threatened or rare plants may also be described by their hardiness zone or heat zone tolerances unknown plants can be identified by using a dichotomous analytical key hundreds of keys exist some dealing with a limited group of plants others more encompassing all require the searcher to choose the plants identifying features from among a series of couplets use of the keys requires that the searcher know the terminology used to describe leaves twigs flowers and fruits leaves are described in terms of their shapes margins lobing bases vein patterns apex styles surface pubescence and whether they are simple or compound twigs are described on the basis of their bud types terminal buds bud and leaf arrangements petiole scar shapes prominence of their lenticels and stipule scars and type of pith flowers re described by the position of the ovary in relation to the flower parts or by the arrangement of flowers on the stem fruit are described as simple aggregate multiple or accessory depending on the number of flowers and ovaries involved in their formation,in plant taxonomy physical characteristics are crucial for identification a trained horticulturist uses descriptive terminology to differentiate plant parts for dichotomous keys leaves are analyzed for features like shape margin vein pattern apex and whether theyre smooth or pubescent haircovered they can be simple one unit or compound multiple leaflets twigs are described by bud type bud arrangement leaf petiole scars lenticel prominence and pith type offering clues for plant identification flowers can be classified based on the position of the ovary eg hypogynous perigynous or epigynous and their arrangement as singular composite or inflorescence fruits the ripened ovaries vary widely classified as simple aggregate multiple or accessory depending on flower origin and structure simple fruits like drupes consist of an exocarp mesocarp and endocarp layers as seen in peaches using dichotomous keys with these descriptors allows horticulturists to systematically classify unknown plants regular practice with unknown specimens reinforces terminology aiding in accurate plant recognition
what is soil if asked to define soil most people would probably describe where it is rather than what it is they might also describe what it does but not how it does it like so much of the natural world soil is taken for granted praised when the backyard garden is bountiful and disparaged when it is tracked in on the new carpet perhaps the greatest evidence of knowing little about the soil is to label it dirt soil is the underground environment of plants and that part of the definition where it is is generally understood by all what it does and how it originates are less widely understood most people are aware that the plant life of the continent changes greatly from region to region it should not be too surprising then to learn that the soil also changes considerably from place to place therefore any attempt to define and describe soil must be approached in general terms applicable from the red clay regions of georgia through the loam fields of iowa to the deserts of utah soil is the thin outer layer of the earths crust made up of weathered minerals living and nonliving organisms water and air to understand fully that definition is to understand much of modern soil science weathered minerals imagine a crosssectional slice made down into the earths crust figure 31 this is called a soil profile the mineral content of soil results from the weathering of solid bedrock or other parent material over long periods of time the solid rock is acted on by an assortment of natural forces including temperature alternations that crack the rock water that freezes within the cracks and plant roots that further pry the cracks open then follows abrasive grinding by wind water and sometimes ice lichens and microbes may produce organic acids that react with the rock to further weaken it while the weathering of parent material takes place over eons of geological time it is nonetheless a simple breakdown of large pieces of rock into smaller particles living and nonliving organisms over time distinctive layers develop in undisturbed soils between the parent layer and the topsoil is the subsoil subsoil is finely weathered like the topsoil but it lacks organic matter in the quantity found in the topsoil layer the roots of green plants flourish in the topsoil richest in organic matter and shallowest in depth and rely on it for nutrients support water and air the organic matter in soil comes from the decomposition of plant and animal tissue when green plants are plowed into the soil they are immediately acted on by soil organisms that rapidly break the plant tissue down into a form usable for their own growth organic compounds that do not decompose quickly eventually succumb to enzymatic action forming a complex mixture called humus humus as well as green manure plowed under green plants are important to the soils structure this organic matter increases both the waterholding and mineralholding capacity of the soil water and air water and air exist around and between the soil particles as much as 50 percent of the topsoil may be air and water in liquid or vapor form the ratio of air to water depends on the texture of the soil and how wet it is a wet soil leaves less space for the air to occupy than a dry soil why soils differ soils vary in many ways they vary in color and weight some drain easily whereas others stay wet and boglike some are rocky breaking tools and backs while others are easy to dig even though the original parent stone may be the same or similar differences in the subsoil and topsoil may result from variations in weathering elements soil movement topography climate amount of organic mater soils that weather from bedrock and remain in place are termed sedentary in contrast to transported soils transported soils have been moved by the forces of nature 1 have moved in response to gravity as after a land colluvial soils slide or mudslide 2 are carried in water such as rivers they are eventu alluvial soils ally deposited on flood plains and at deltas 3 are transported and deposited by winds aeolian soils 4 is soil deposited by glaciers glacial till the best agricultural soils are usually alluvial and glacial till colluvial soils are characterized by coarse textures and other undesirable chemical and physical qualities aeolian soils are finely textured but vary greatly in their productivity sedentary soils may be useful for agriculture if they have not lost their nutrient elements soil separates and soil texture as the parent rock weathers it forms particles of differing sizes based on their diameter these particles are classified into groups called soil separates in decreasing order of size the separates are 1 gravel coarse and fine20 mm or more in diameter 2 sand very coarse200100 mm medium 5025 mm fine 2510 mm and very fine 1005 mm 3 silt05002 mm in diameter 4 clayless than 0002 mm in diameter the relative proportions of these separates of different sizes in any one soil create the soil texture the proportions can only be determined precisely in a soil laboratory there a series of sieves are used to separate out the sand and gravel if present while a suspension and settling technique is used to separate and measure the percentages of silt and clay figure 32 most soils in nature contain sand silt and clay in some proportions the textural names given to soils are ways of describing these proportions for example if a soil contains about 40 percent sand 20 percent of the finer clay and 40 percent silt separates it is termed a loam loams are generally favored for horticultural field production because they have enough sand to provide good drainage and aeration yet enough of the finer particles to retain moisture and provide necessary plant nutrients as will be discussed later when one or two separates dominate the mixture the textural name given the soil reflects that domination as in sandy loam silt loam silty clay loam sandy clay silty clay and so on in order to appreciate soil textural names the physical and chemical properties of the separates should be considered sand sand particles have assorted shapes and sizes depending on how they were weathered they range from smooth and round to sharp and angular the spaces between sand particles are large compared to the spaces between silt and clay particles water passes through sand quickly because of this large pore space and air is present in greatest quantity in sand sand is low in mineral nutrients and is generally inactive chemically silt silt particles are irregularly shaped and much smaller than most sand particles given identical volumes of sand and silt there would be many more silt than sand particles hence silt has a greater surface area than sand since water clings to particle surfaces the result is that silt holds water in the soil far better than sand it does not provide as much space for air however like sand silt has a low nutrient level and is not very active chemically clay clay has very small platelike particles it possesses the greatest surface area of all the separates water is held tightly to the clay particles and passes very slowly through the soil predictably air is often in short supply in a heavy clay soil especially when it is wet clay has an adhesive quality when moistened and squeezed this is what gives cohesiveness to soil sometimes too much creating sticky hardtoplow fields clay is active chemically many of the particles have surface charges that attract water and ions the term for such a chemical state is colloidal it is the colloidal quality of clay that makes it important for chemical activity and nutrient exchange in the soil the names of soil textures should now assume descriptive meaning for example a sandy loam would possess the following characteristics sand silt and clay separates present with sand dominant drainage good and perhaps slightly excessive nutrient content good since clay is present aeration good due to the sand assuming that it is not too fine waterholding capability fair to good depending on the amount of organic material and clay the united states department of agriculture usda soil texture triangle illustrates how soils are named based on a laboratory determination of their composition figure 33,soil is the top layer of the earths crust a mixture of weathered minerals organic matter water and air it supports plant life but soil composition and characteristics vary greatly depending on location and formation processes mineral content originates from the breakdown of bedrock weathered over time by natural forces including temperature changes water wind and organisms organic matter is derived from decomposed plants and animals contributing to soil fertility and forming humus which improves the soils ability to retain water and nutrients soil layers include topsoil subsoil and bedrock the texture of soilits composition of sand silt and claydetermines its properties sand provides good aeration but poor water retention silt holds more water and clay retains water tightly and has strong chemical activity important for nutrient exchange soils also vary based on their origin sedentary soils remain on bedrock while transported soils move via wind water or glaciers soil types such as loam combine sand silt and clay in balanced proportions making them ideal for agriculture understanding soil texture and composition aids in identifying soil types and determining their suitability for various plants
soil nutrients as described in chapter 1 green plants require nutrients that they obtain from the soil a rich loam soil will provide a balanced supply of the elements essential to the growth of most plants a soil that is predominantly sand or silt will be nutritionally poor the need by green plants for at least 17 separate chemical elements has been proven repeatedly through tests that demonstrate growth abnormalities when any one of these essential elements is lacking as previously mentioned the amount of the chemical element required by a plant is not a measure of the elements essentiality whether required in large amounts macronutrients or very small amounts micronutrients the element is essential if the plant cannot grow and develop normally without it the elements presently known to be vital to the survival of green plants are shown along with their chemical symbols in table 31 one method of remembering the essential elements is to associate them with a catchy

the soil the remainder are absorbed as minerals from the soil around the plants roots knowing that the elements are necessary still does not address the question of what each element does for the plant that makes it so essential the roles of several have not yet been clearly defined they are believed to allow certain enzyme systems to function normally in the plant at least some of the functions of other essential elements are known as well as the symptoms shown by the plant when the element is lacking or in short supply a brief summary of the functions of 14 essential mineral elements and the symptoms of their deficiency is given in table 32 both the functions and symptoms are discussed further in later chapters in addition to the 14 essential mineral elements and 3 essential nonmineral elements there is another group known as the beneficial elements they have been found to promote plant growth in many species but have not been proven to be absolutely necessary for completion of the plants life cycle future research may yet prove them to be essential currently regarded as beneficial elements are silica sodium cobalt and selenium other elements being considered for inclusion as beneficial are chromium vanadium and titanium plants may exhibit symptoms of nutrient deficiency for several reasons the element may be lacking totally or not be present in sufficient quantity the element may be bound in a chemical form unavailable or too slowly available to the plant there may be an overall imbalance of nutrients in the soil while micronutrients can be and often are deficient in soils macronutrients are most often deficient nitrogen is foremost among the elements regularly lacking in sufficient quantities to produce strong healthy plants when nitrogen in the nitrate form is not absorbed by the colloidal particles of the soil it passes quickly through the root region of the soil in an action called leaching soil structure and organic material in good loam soils small soil particles adhere together to form larger particles or aggregates this arrangement of soil particles into aggregates is termed the soil structure structure resulting from small porous aggregates is highly desirable since it blends the desirable qualities of looseness drainage and aeration with water and mineral retention in the bare hand good loam soil feels like short pastry dough this may explain why such a structure is often referred to as a crumb structure or a granular structure since the granular structure of soil is a desirable attribute resulting in highquality horticultural and field crops it is important to understand how such soil structure develops and can be encouraged the most significant factor in the development of a granular structure is organic matter including green manure soil organisms decomposing plant roots and especially humus the organic material and colloidal clay bind the small mineral particles together as crumblike aggregates humus is highly significant as a binding agent the characteristics of organic matter have already been described briefly when a field of grasses weeds and other herbaceous plants is turned under the green manure represented by their plant parts is rapidly acted on by organisms of the soil macrobial life such as insects and earthworms feed on the plant parts to obtain the chemical energy bound within them microbial lifeprincipally algae fungi bacteria and actinomycetesmay directly attack the decomposing plant parts or contribute indirectly through digesting the excretions of the macrobes and the dead macrobes themselves the breakdown of dead plant tissue and other organic material by the microorganisms of the soil is accomplished with digestive enzymes in a manner similar to the way an animals stomach digests food some chemical compounds within the plant break down more quickly than others the simple proteins sugars and starches decompose quickly the more complex organic compounds like lignin a component of the cell wall decompose more slowly eventually though all organic matter decomposes into either humus energy or a number of other end products including carbon dioxide water nitrates phosphates sulfates and calcium compounds the energy release explains why the temperature rises inside a compost pile soil acidity and alkalinity the soils water held between the particles and granules of the soil contains dissolved mineral salts this liquid is known as the soil solution the way the soil solution reacts determines the acidity alkalinity or neutrality of the soil many farmers and home gardeners still refer to the sweetness or sourness of the soil harking back to a time when differences in the soils reaction could be observed and dealt with even if the causes were not fully understood today it is understood that some soils contain more hydrogen ions h than hydroxyl ions oh this makes them acidic other soils contain more hydroxyl ions than hydrogen ions they are termed alkaline when a soil contains equal concentrations of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions it is termed neutral the exact relationship between the hydrogen and hydroxyl ions is expressed as a ph number figure 34 a ph of 70 is neutral a ph of less than 70 is acidic a ph of more than 70 is alkaline the ph of a soil can only be measured precisely using an instrument known as a ph meter figure 35 commercial growers and homeowners can either send soil samples to state or private testing laboratories for a ph test at a nominal charge or purchase their own portable ph meter for immediate results there are also ph test kits on the market but their results are imprecise compared to those obtained with a ph meter in situations in which the crop is very sensitive to soil ph the ph meter test should be used additions to the soil that increase the number of h ions will lower the ph of the soil conversely soil additions that increase the number of oh ions will raise the soil ph many of the materials used to improve the structure and texture of the soil will also modify its ph for example peat moss is highly acidic and its addition to the soil as a source of organic material will have a direct impact on the acidity of the soil solution limestone has the opposite effect contributing alkalinity to the solution these changes in the ph may or may not be desirable thus additives should be used with caution and with a knowledge of their total impact obviously it is easier to adjust the ph of a greenhouse bench or pot crop in which the soil mixture is totally within the control of the grower than it is to change the ph of a 100acre nursery field especially since many soils have a strong buffer resistance to ph change buffering occurs when hydrogen ions that are held in adsorbed form dissociate from the clay particles and enter into the soil solution to replace those hydrogen ions neutralized by the addition of lime no ph change will result until enough lime is added to deplete the supply of hydrogen ions that constitute a reserve of acidity in the soil if the reserve acidity is strong and the field is large a significant change in ph may be impossible where strong buffer resistance is not a factor the ph of nursery fields can be altered to improve crop production within the ph range of 40 to 90 the availability of many mineral nutrients is determined by the acidity or alkalinity of the soil for example many plants will exhibit a distinctively patterned yellowing or chlorosis when grown in soil having a high ph the cause of the chlorosis is lack of iron in the plant tissue and it results because iron compounds needed by the plant are precipitated out of the soil solution and rendered unavailable to the plant at a lower ph the iron will remain in the soil solution and be available for plant uptake cation exchange to understand how colloidal clay particles and humus contribute to the chemical reactions of the soil how the soils ph can be modified and how the application of chemical fertilizer can increase the nutrients in soil requires an understanding of cation exchange the term refers to the capacity of colloidal particles to attract positively charged ions cations and to exchange one ion for another without cation exchange nutrients would be readily leached from the soil with cation exchange the hydrogen cations held by the colloidal particles can be replaced by cations furnished through the decomposition of organic material the weathering of rocks or the application of fertilizers it follows that soils having a higher percentage of colloidal particles such as clay soils and organic soils have a higher capacity for cation exchange than sandy soils that are lower in colloidal particles therefore they have a higher capacity to hold available nutrients and resist loss due to leaching role in ph it is the replacement of hydroxyl cations on the colloidal particles of the soil by hydrogen ions that makes a soil acidic to make a soil more acidic lower the ph elemental sulfur is usually added in the soil bacteria convert the sulfur to sulfuric acid to make the soil more alkaline increase the ph calcium or calciummagnesium compounds are commonly used the influence of ph on cation exchange is centered around the availability of nutrients as described earlier and illustrated by iron chlorosis at high soil ph there are other elements that become bound tightly within the soil and are unavailable to plants when the ph is high just as there are elements made unavailable when the ph is too low at extremely low or high ph ranges the mere excess of h or oh ions can be toxic to the plants figure 36 illustrates how various nutrients become more or less available to the plants as the ph of the soil increases or decreases role in mineral absorption it seems logical to assume that minerals are absorbed into plant roots as water is absorbed it is a logical assumption but an incorrect one the uptake of water and the uptake of minerals are independent processes minerals enter root cells through a permeable membrane when the concentration of the mineral salts in the soil solution is greater than in the root cell such a condition creates a concentration gradient since plants are continually using the mineral salts within the roots the concentration gradient serves to explain how certain elements are absorbed with others absorption occurs even against a concentration gradient the explanation is thought to reside with ion exchange or with contact exchange in ion exchange a positively charged ion may be absorbed by a root cell if another positively charged ion is released from the cell another form of ion exchange can occur when both a positively charged ion cation and a negatively charged ion anion are absorbed by the root cell together thus maintaining the electrostatic equilibrium in the cell in contact exchange the intimate association between the soil particles and the root hairs is the key a direct exchange occurs between the ions adsorbed to the particles of soil and those of the root cells,soil nutrients are critical for plant growth with green plants needing 17 essential elements these elements are divided into macronutrients required in large quantities like nitrogen and phosphorus and micronutrients needed in smaller amounts such as iron and zinc plants primarily obtain carbon hydrogen and oxygen from air and water while the remaining essential nutrients are absorbed from the soil beneficial elements like silica sodium cobalt and selenium support growth but are not universally essential soil structure particularly in loam balances water retention and aeration with organic matter such as humus and decomposed roots enhancing structure by forming aggregates soil ph a measure of acidity or alkalinity is crucial as it influences nutrient availability acidic soils have more hydrogen ions h while alkaline soils contain more hydroxyl ions oh adjusting ph can improve crop growth though soils with strong buffering resistance may resist ph changes cation exchange the soils ability to hold and swap positively charged ions plays a key role in retaining nutrients and reducing leaching mineral absorption into roots occurs through ion and contact exchanges where specific ions are exchanged or absorbed allowing plants to uptake necessary nutrients efficiently
fertilizers fertilizers are nutrient additives applied to the soil periodically to maintain optimum crop productivity the need for fertilization may result from a deficiency of one or more mineral elements in the soil their presence in a form unavailable to the plant or the leaching of elements into the soil to a depth below the root zone chemical fertilizers since nitrogen phosphorus and potassium are the soil elements used in greatest quantity by the green plant a fertilizer that provides all three elements is termed a complete fertilizer the actual percentage by weight of each of the three primary elements in a fertilizer determines its analysis for example 100 pounds of 1064 analysis fertilizer contains 10 pounds of nitrogen n 6 pounds of phosphoric acid p2o5 and 4 pounds of potash k2o the analysis figures are always expressed in the same order and represent the same nutrients note that phosphorus and potassium are not present in elemental form but as chemical compounds thus the amount of actual element provided for the plant is less than the analysis implies figure 37 with simple arithmetic fertilizers can be compared on the basis of their nutrient ratio the ratio is a reduction of the analysis to the lowest common denominator for example a 51010 analysis has a ratio of 122 each of the numbers has been reduced through dividing by a common factor of 5 a fertilizer analysis of 102020 also has a ratio of 122 therefore a 51010 fertilizer supplies the three major nutrients in the same proportion as a 102020 fertilizer but twice as much of the actual product must be applied to obtain the same amount of nutrients table 33 when less than 30 percent of a complete fertilizers weight represents available nutrients it is termed a lowanalysis fertilizer when the amount of available nutrients is 30 percent or more the product is a highanalysis fertilizer the remaining material in a fertilizer is filler either organic or synthetic the filler may provide some additional essential elements and may even be important as a source of micronutrients but essentially the filler is a carrier for the available macronutrients it allows them to be applied evenly to the soil and crop it also adds weight and bulk both undesirable features table 34 compares highanalysis and lowanalysis fertilizers the more common chemical fertilizers include anhydrous ammonia ammonium nitrate urea sodium nitrate and ammonium sulfate as carriers of nitrogen superphosphates ammoniated phosphates and round rock phosphate as carriers of phosphorus and potassium nitrate potassium chloride potassium sulfate and potassiummagnesium sulfate as carriers of potassium organic fertilizers organic fertilizers tend to be low in nutrient content especially nitrogen although they enjoy some popularity with organic gardeners and hobbyists they have limited application to commercial ornamental horticulture not only are the nutrients limited in the organics but they are often more slowly available to the plant than those in chemical fertilizers organic fertilizers include materials such as dried blood cocoa meal animal manures dried sewage sludge and bone meal the latter two materials have some commercial usage sewage sludge is used as a topdressing on golf greens and bone meal as a highphosphorus fertilizer for flower bulbs ammonification and nitrification the presence of an element in the soil does not guarantee that the plant can make use of it it may be an essential element but in a form that must undergo chemical change before being available to the plant nitrogen is made available in green plants as nitrate salts no3 or ammonium salts nh4 in turn members of the animal kingdom depend almost exclusively on green plants for their nitrogen that they take from plants proteins and amino acids nitrogen salts are not found as minerals in the soil they are formed by the decomposition of nonliving plants plant parts animals or excretory products integral to this degradation are several separate groups of bacteria that are key factors in the twin conversions known as ammonification and nitrification ammonification is the conversion of nitrogen in organic compounds to ammonia nitrification is the conversion of ammonia to nitrite then to nitrate as shown 2 nh4 4o2 2 no2 4h2o energy ammonia nitrite 2 no2 o2 2 no3 energy nitrite nitrate the energy produced by these reactions is used by the bacteria for their growth and development three additional points deserve mention first the nitrifying bacteria are sensitive to low temperatures acidity and poor drainage in such conditions the bacteria do not drive the biochemical changes as rapidly as they do under more favorable conditions second the microorganisms of the soil need nitrogen for growth as much as green plants or animals do as a result the addition of large quantities of organic matter to the soil can result in a temporary decline in the amount of nitrogen available to crop plants as the soil microbial population increases finally three genera of bacteria azotobacter clostridium and rhizobium are able to convert atmospheric nitrogen gas n2 into organic compounds after the bacteria die the processes of ammonification and nitrification release the nitrogen for use by green plants especially important is the relationship between the rhizobium bacteria and members of the bean family the legumes or leguminosae the bacteria live in the legume roots where they obtain organic food materials in return the bacteria capture or fix nitrogen gas making it available to the green plant phosphorus phosphorus is present in very small amounts in mineral soils an even smaller amount is present in a form usable by plants at any one time since even simple phosphorus compounds are usually insoluble in the soil solution along with nitrogen which is also present in small amounts phosphorus is often a limiting factor in soil nutrition much of the soils phosphorus is bound within the organic matter of the soil and becomes available to plants as organic material decomposes the phosphorus held within the mineral matter of the soil is much more slowly available to the plant only through a slow interaction between the insoluble phosphate water carbon dioxide and various root exudates does the phosphate become watersoluble and hence available even then the soluble phosphates can quickly revert to complex insoluble forms especially as the ph increases or decreases potassium potassium is present in soil in much larger quantities than either nitrogen or phosphorus nearly all the soils potassium is in inorganic forms however and inorganic potassium is not readily available to plants it becomes available slowly through the reaction of water and carbonic acid in the soil with the feldspars micas and other sources of insoluble potassium the other essential elements require similar chemical reaction in the soil to become available for absorption by the plant soil chemistry is a complex field of study and the brief treatment given the subject here has only touched on a few of the points necessary to an understanding of crop production soil is the thin outer layer of the earths crust made up of weathered minerals living and nonliving organisms water and air it provides the underground environment of plants in profile three distinctive layers can be seen bedrock or parent material subsoil and topsoil both subsoil and topsoil are finely weathered from the parent material but topsoil contains more organic matter than subsoil as a result it is more supportive of plant growth organic matter is composed of plant and animal compounds that soil microbes can rapidly break down and of humus humus is a complex colloidal mixture that originates with organic compounds that do not decompose easily humus and other organic matter are important in the development of good soil structure causing small soil particles to bind and form larger particles or aggregates soils differ in many ways such as color weight drainage rockiness and texture the differences result from weathering elements soil movement topography climate and variations in the amount of organic matter when parent material weathers particles of differing sizes are formed the four groups of weathered particles or separates are gravel sand silt and clay the relative proportion of these separates in any one soil creates the soil texture the textural name of a soil roughly describes the particular mixture of separates that it contains because of their colloidal properties clay and humus are instrumental in making nutrients available to plants seventeen nutrients have been found essential to the growth of green plants c h o p k n s ca mg fe mo b cu mn zn ci ni of these essential elements only carbon hydrogen and oxygen are obtained by the plant from sources other than the soil the remainder are absorbed as minerals from the soil around plant roots when one or more elements is lacking totally or in part is bound in a form unavailable to the plant or is part of an overall nutrient imbalance in the soil the plant will exhibit symptoms of nutrient deficiency several other elements have been found to be beneficial to plant growth even though they are not essential to completion of the plant life cycle the soil solution is a liquid composed of water held within the soil and mineral salts dissolved in the water how the soil solution reacts chemically determines its acidity or alkalinity and is expressed as a ph number soils that contain more hydrogen ions h than hydroxyl ions oh are acidic and have a ph of less than 70 soils containing more hydroxyl ions than hydrogen ions are alkaline and have a ph greater than 70 a soil with equal concentrations of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions is neutral and has a ph of 70 soil additives can raise or lower the ph of the soil depending on whether they increase the number of h ions or oh ions modification of ph and nutrient uptake by plants depend on cation exchange the capacity of colloidal particles to attract positively charged ions cations and exchange one ion for another those soils with a higher percentage of colloidal particles such as clays and organic soils have the highest cation exchange capacity if soil ph becomes too high or too low certain elements become bound tightly within the soil and unavailable to the plants fertilizers are nutrient additives applied to the soil periodically to maintain optimum crop productivity they may be complete or incomplete highanalysis or lowanalysis inorganic chemical or organic usually the elements within the fertilizer must undergo chemical changes before becoming available to the plant ammonification and nitrification exemplify such changes,fertilizers are essential soil additives that provide nutrients to support optimal crop productivity countering deficiencies in elements necessary for plant growth they are classified into chemical and organic types chemical fertilizers are often complete containing the primary nutrients nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k which are used in large amounts by plants these fertilizers can be highanalysis with more than 30 nutrient content or lowanalysis less than 30 the nutrient content is described by ratios like 122 indicating the proportion of npk organic fertilizers such as bone meal and manure are slower to release nutrients making them less effective for intensive commercial agriculture but useful in sustainable practices for plants to access nitrogen processes like ammonification and nitrification convert nitrogen into ammonium and nitrate forms soil ph which measures acidity or alkalinity and cation exchange capacity also affect nutrient availability acidic soils ph 7 have more hydrogen ions while alkaline soils ph 7 have more hydroxyl ions adjusting soil ph and understanding these processes helps maintain balanced nutrient uptake for crops
growth regulators defined green plants contain a number of organic compounds that control plant growth these compounds are present only in minute amounts yet they stimulate inhibit and otherwise modify the rate the direction and the nature of plant development the compounds that occur naturally are called hormones they may be produced in one part of the plant yet exert their effect in another part far removed from the source still other modifiers of plant development are synthesized by chemists and made available to commercial horticulturists for the production of more desirable crops all of the products either naturally occurring or commercially synthesized are given the name of growth regulators types of growth regulators most plant scientists would agree that our knowledge of plant growth regulators is still incomplete the regulators have probably not all been isolated their effects at different concentrations vary their effects in different species of plants vary and even the sites of their production and activity within plants vary at present we have a fair knowledge of auxins gibberellins and cytokinins we have a limited knowledge of several others auxins auxins are plant hormones that both promote and inhibit plant growth indoleacetic acid iaa is the most commonly occurring natural auxin figure 41 auxins have been found responsible for phototropism geotropism and apical dominance our knowledge of auxins began with the curiosity of scientists who wondered why stems grow up and roots grow down why plant stems seem to bend toward the light and why the removal of an apical or terminal bud stimulates the growth of lateral buds beneath it studies with the sheathlike covering coleoptile of the young stem of oat seedlings avena have provided the evidence on which our understanding of auxins is based seedlings exposed to light from only one side bend toward the light source charles darwin first recorded the observation that seedlings bend toward the light only if the tips are exposed when the seedling tips are covered with caps that do not allow the passage of light the seedling tips do not bend figure 42 the conclusion drawn from darwins studies was that a substance produced in the tips can exert an influence on the growth of tissue some distance from the tip such a conclusion is compatible with the definition of a hormone researchers after darwin continued to experiment in one experiment the tips of seedlings were removed a bit of gelatin was added to each cut stump and the tips were replaced the seedlings still bent toward a unilateral light source when the tips were not replaced the seedlings did not bend figure 43 the conclusion was that whatever accelerated the growth on the unlighted side of the stem was able to diffuse through the gelatin a test called the avena coleoptile test has shown that a freshly cut tip replaced on one side of the coleoptile stump will promote more growth on that side than on the other side figure 44 the curvature will occur even without the unilateral light source leading to the conclusion that the coleoptile tips are the source of the hormone and that tissue growth stimulation is its effect in an actively growing stem the concentration of auxin in the tip or apex is so great that it can inhibit the growth of buds and shoots beneath it this influence is termed apical dominance when the apex bud or shoot is removed thus diminishing the supply of auxin the la eral buds and shoots are allowed to grow the horticultural practice of pruning to promote denser growth involves overcoming apical dominance by removing the tips of branches auxins are present in plant roots as well as in shoots the research of k v thimann provided evidence that roots are much more sensitive than shoots to auxin the same amount of auxin that promotes cell elongation in shoots can inhibit growth in roots figure 45 the ability of auxin to promote and inhibit plant growth explains why shoots grow upward and roots grow downward figure 46 when a coleoptile or stem is placed in a horizontal position auxin accumulates in higher concentrations on the lower side of the plant the auxin causes the cells on the underside of the shoot to elongate faster than the cells on the upper side so the shoot grows upward the same concentration of auxin inhibits the growth of the cells on the lower side of the roots allowing the cells on the upper surface to grow faster and direct the root downward the response of auxin to gravity and the resulting growth reaction in plants is termed geotropism the mechanism of auxin action is not fully understood although several theories exist one line of research has correlated the presence of auxin with the production of ethylene in plants since some of the responses associated with auxins can be duplicated by exposing the plants to ethylene the theory is that the growth responses attributed to auxins actually result from ethylene produced through the auxin presence another theory is that auxin increases the plasticity of the cell walls permitting the cells to expand to larger sizes still another theory is that auxin increases the energy supply in the tissue where it is present and this increased metabolic activity stimulates plant growth gibberellins gibberellins are a group of thirty or more closely related plant hormones that promote cell enlargement often causing dramatic increases in plant height one of the common forms is gibberellic acid figure 47 they will not cause curvature in avena coeloptiles but will cause dwarf corn plants to elongate and grow to normal size since auxins will not affect dwarf corn plants the two growth hormones can be clearly distinguished by scientists the number of plant processes known to be affected by gibberllins is not as great as those known to be influenced by auxins but their influence is nonetheless impressive rosetted plants can be made to grow tall following the application of gibberellic acid dormant seeds that normally require a cold treatment stratification for germination can be made to germinate without the treatment when gibberellic acid is applied instead also various other plant processes normally initiated in response to temperature andor photoperiod stimulations can be prompted instead by the application of gibberellins rosetted plants are those having good leaf development but retarded internodal growth under natural growing conditions such plants will respond to longday photoperiods or a period of cold treatment with a dramatic elongation of the internodes bolting and the production of flowers atop a stem five or six times the original height of the plant when kept under shortday conditions or in warm temperatures the plants remain rosetted since the treatment of plants with gibberellin under conditions normally promotive of rosetting can induce bolting and flowering it is suggested that the stage of growth of the plant is controlled by the amount of natural gibberellin present within the plants both cell division and cell enlargement occur in the plants treated with the gibberellin both gibberellins and auxins when applied to the pistils of certain flowers can cause them to set fruit without being pollinated the process is called parthenocarpy and the resulting seedless fruit are called parthenocarpic fruit examples most readers would recognize are the naval orange the banana and the seedless grape in ordinary pollination growth hormones are introduced to the pistil from pollen produced on the stamen or synthesized in the ovary following a stimulus from pollen through observation and study of these and other plant processes scientists are able to theorize about the role of gibberellins in plants gibberellins have been known to stimulate cell division and cell enlargement in young embryos of germinating grains evidence suggests that the gibberellin activates genes that are normally repressed as the genes become active new ribonucleic acid rna the carrier of genetic information and new enzymes result the new enzymes digest and release materials stored in the endosperm these materials then become available to the developing embryo thereby promoting cellular activity that might otherwise be inhibited it is doubtful whether such an explanation covers all the effects of gibberellins however cytokinins cytokinins are naturally occurring hormones of which the best known is kinetin figure 48 the principal role of the cytokinins is the division of cells but an expanding body of evidence suggests their involvement in many other plant growth processes that involvement seems to be in association with gibberellins auxins and other growth regulators in their interaction with auxins cytokinins have been found to promote either cell enlargement or cell division the initiation and growth of roots and shoots as well as the overcoming of apical dominance have all been linked to the presence of cytokinins cytokinins can be distinguished from auxins and gibberellins with a diagnostic test that involves the culture of tobacco parenchymal cells in a nutrient solution when kinetic and auxin are added to the solution cell division is accelerated in the tobacco tissue no effect on dwarf corn plants or avena coleoptile curvature results when cytokinins are applied so the three tests are important biological detectors for the growth regulating hormones other growth regulators in addition to the three naturally occurring hormones already described other natural and synthetic plant hormones are known to exist among them are abscisic acida naturally occurring growth inhibitor that counters the effects of gibberellins it can promote the premature abscission of leaves and fruits ethyleneinfluences geotropism leaf abscission and the ripening of fruit it is a natural hormone antigibberellinsa group of synthetic compounds that have a dwarfing effect on plant growth it is likely that further research will find that many plant growth responses stem from the synergistic action of two or more growth regulators since they can coexist within the same tissue and often promote similar responses in the plant their combined action seems predictable,plant growth regulators are natural and synthetic compounds that influence plant development even in small amounts key natural hormones include auxins gibberellins and cytokinins auxins eg indoleacetic acid regulate growth by promoting stem elongation and responses to light phototropism and gravity geotropism they also create apical dominance where the main shoot suppresses lateral bud growth allowing vertical growth pruning can reduce this effect by removing the apical bud gibberellins stimulate cell enlargement and plant height increase they also induce seed germination and flowering in some plants without environmental triggers like cold or light cytokinins support cell division and work with auxins to promote root and shoot development they can also counteract apical dominance additional regulators like ethylene and abscisic acid impact ripening leaf shedding and growth inhibition especially under stress synthetic regulators help control crop growth in horticulture growth regulators play a crucial role in agriculture allowing control over plant growth patterns and crop quality
commercial growth regulators even without fully understanding the way growth regulators work scientists have been able to synthesize products that influence the growth of plants in a similar manner many products of commercial importance are growth retardants and are used in the floriculture trade to produce shorter potted crops several are used by greenhouse and nursery propagators to promote rooting of cuttings figure 49 more recently products have been developed that reduce the rate of growth of turfgrasses under regular growing conditions some greenhouse plants grow too tall to make desirable potted plants poinsettias easter lilies chrysanthemums and some hydrangeas can all get leggy if started too early or subjected to overly warm temperatures during the period of most rapid vegetative growth the application of growth retardants to the plants helps to regulate their size figure 410 with potted azaleas more flower buds can be induced and stem growth limited with the application of growth regulating chemicals table 41 lists the commercial growth retardants most commonly used by greenhouse growers and describes their effects in the nursery and florist trades where vegetative cuttings are rooted commercially available growth regulators are usually used to promote and accelerate root formation the most popular rootpromoting hormones are the auxins indoleacetic acid iaa indolebutyric acid iba and napthaleneacetic acid naa applied as dusts or solutions to the ends of cuttings the auxins can speed rooting time considerably assuming other requirements for growth are not limited figure 411 where there is a large expanse of turfgrass there is also a need to keep it mowed in temperate zones lawn areas may require mowing thirty or more times during a normal growing season often the terrain is sloping and difficult or dangerous to mow with the application of growth retardants turf growth can be restrained with a significant saving in the cost of fuel and labor normally required for mowing use of the retardants is wisely restricted to lowquality minimum use difficulttomow areas since they often cause discoloration thinning and reduced ability to recover from winter injury the chemical regulators are often applied in combination with broadleaved weed killers since the retardants are often ineffective against many weeds table 42 describes the commercial growth retardants most commonly used by turf specialists most of the turf growth regulators are applied twice each season with six weeks or more between applications although the chemical products are not a substitute for mowing they do save money figure 412 plant growth regulators are organic compounds that control the rate direction and nature of plant growth knowledge of plant growth regulators is incomplete however a great deal is known about auxins gibberellins and cytokinins auxins are hormones naturally occurring growth regulators that promote and inhibit plant growth indoleacetic acid iaa is the most commonly occurring natural auxin auxins occur in shoots and roots in the shoots they are responsible for apical dominance they are also responsible for various tropisms in plants gibberellins are hormones that promote cell division and enlargement in plants often causing dramatic increases in plant height thirty or more gibberellins are known they can overcome rosetting in plants cause dormant seeds to germinate and cause flowers to set fruit without pollination cytokinins are also hormones the best known is kinetin evidence indicates that the principle role of cytokinins is to accelerate cell division in association with auxins they may also promote cell enlargement the initiation of roots and shoots and the overcoming of apical dominance have all been linked to the presence of cytokinins each of the plant growth regulators can be identified by a distinctive diagnostic test even without fully understanding how these hormones work scientists have been able to synthesize products that influence the growth of plants in a similar manner the synthetic products are most frequently used either to retard the growth of florist crops that tend to get too tall or to promote branching or heavier flower set they are also used to restrict the growth of turfgrass in lowquality minimumuse or difficulttomow areas,commercial growth regulators are synthesized compounds that influence plant growth aiding in the control of plant size and rooting processes these regulators are commonly used in floriculture and horticulture to regulate height growth retardants help control the height of potted plants such as poinsettias and easter lilies preventing them from becoming leggy due to warm temperatures promote root formation rooting hormones such as auxins indoleacetic acid iaa indolebutyric acid iba and napthaleneacetic acid naa stimulate root development in cuttings making propagation more efficient manage turfgrass growth growth retardants can also slow turfgrass growth reducing the need for frequent mowing especially in difficulttomow areas key plant hormones include auxins control apical dominance and various growth tropisms gibberellins promote cell enlargement seed germination and flowering cytokinins accelerate cell division and promote root and shoot initiation these products are particularly useful in greenhouse and nursery settings for both aesthetic control and labor cost savings
plant reproduction defined when organisms duplicate themselves the process is termed reproduction although only partially understood plant reproduction is recognized as a complicated process that results in the multiplication of cells and the organisms that they make up when reproduction is deliberately controlled and manipulated it becomes propagation ornamental horticulturists who control the reproduction of plants are called plant propagators in large operations this can be a fulltime occupation sexual and asexual reproduction the reproduction of plants through the formation of seeds is called sexual reproduction it requires the fusion of two sex cells or gametes each having one set of chromosomes haploidal to form a cell with two sets of chromosomes diploidal that is termed a zygote the gametes are formed through a sequence of cell divisions that reduces the number of chromosomes in each cell by half the process is termed meiosis figure 51 the creation of a diploidal cell occurs at the time of fertilization through sexual reproduction the genetic material of the cell recombines in a way that can produce new plants differing in physical and physiological characteristics from their parent plants such differences as stronger stems larger flowers and greater winter tolerance may appear in other instances sexual reproduction results in new plants identical in nearly every way to their parent plants the degree of difference is determined largely by the characteristics of the homologous chromosomes those that associate in pairs during meiosis when plants selfpollinate the pairs of genes on the homologous chromosomes are basically alike homozygous and the plants that are produced are nearly exact duplicates when plants crosspollinate the pairs of genes on the homologous chromosomes are often dissimilar the plants that result are not exactly like either parent plant when an exact duplicate of a plant is desired especially if it is not selfpollinating asexual propagation methods must be used asexual reproduction is a vegetative process that eliminates genetic variation the result is the multiplication of plants possessing the same genetic complex asexual reproduction can perpetuate an individual plant essentially unchanged for generations over a period of many years the asexual reproduction of plants is made possible by a combination of two processes termed mitosis and cytokinesis mitosis is the normal division of a cell nucleus that occurs as a plant grows enlarging from embryo to maturity figure 52 it is mitosis that occurs when new roots form on a cutting or new shoots break from a stem the chromosomes in the cells do not reduce in number or recombine as they divide thus allowing no opportunity for a new plant to be initiated cytokinesis completes the division of the nonnuclear remainder of the cells contents and the formation of a new cell wall table 51 summarizes the major distinguishing features of mitosis and meiosis how plants are propagated in the natural world plants reproduce both sexually and asexually for example new plants may arise vegetatively from the root system of a plant while the same plant is producing flowers pollinating and setting fruit and seed many plant species reproduce asexually in assorted ways each a variation of the basic mitosis process although the result is the samethat is continuation of the genetic complex in the new plants some of the reproductive methods are faster or in other ways preferable the method of propagation selected by a grower may be based on ease of propagation number of plants needed rate of growth of the species characteristics desired in the new plant when grafting of two species is involved desire to avoid disease present in the parent plant desire to perpetuate a mutation developing in a parent plant cost sexual propagation sexual propagation utilizes seeds some seeds germinate immediately after planting some require light to germinate others prefer darkness some seeds require pregermination treatment such as scarification or stratification and in some cases both scarification is the breaking of a seed coat otherwise impervious to water to permit water uptake by the embryo stratification is the exposure of the seeds to low temperatures the cold period is believed to initiate the formation of growth regulators or the destruction of growth inhibitors necessary before the seed can germinate in nature scarification may be accomplished by soil microorganisms or passage through the digestive tract of an animal stratification occurs naturally during the winter the horticulturist may simulate and accelerate the activities of nature by treating the hard seed coats of certain plants with acid or by mechanically scratching their seed coats to promote water uptake bulk quantities of dormant seeds may be placed under refrigeration to hasten their stratification asexual propagation asexual propagation utilizes the vegetative parts of a plant to grow new plants stems or roots are more commonly used but leaves can be used as well each vegetative cell has the inherent ability to reproduce an entire plant that is genetically identical to the one from which the cell originated when many plants are reproduced asexually from a single plant the group of new plants is termed a clone each individual plant within the clone is referred to as a ramet plants of horticultural importance that are propagated almost totally by asexual means are termed clonal varieties they are a type of cultivar some plants have been perpetuated by horticulurists for so many years that their original parental origins have become lost in time they depend totally on humans for survival in their present form some of the techniques used by professional horticulturists to propagate plants asexually do little more than allow the plants to grow and reproduce normally other methods of propagation are totally dependent on the efforts of the horticulturist for their success techniques such as grafting and budding may replace the root system of a plant with a hardier one or create a plant having multiple colors of flowers on a single stem such plants are artificial contrivances but nevertheless important in the industry still other propagative techniques are basically natural in origin but subject to manipulation by horticulturists the following list summarizes various asexual techniques runners these are stems that grow along the ground and form new plants at one or more of their nodes the strawberry plant is an example likely to be familiar to most readers the spider plant chorophytum comosum variegatum is an example of an ornamental plant figure 53 propagators need only separate the new rooted plants from the parent and transplant them stolons stolons are aerial shoots that take root after coming into contact with the soil numerous grasses spread in this fashion as do several of the shrubby dogwoods cornus sp as with runners the propagators simply separate the rooted shoot from the parent and transplant sucker shoots certain plants produce new shoots from adventitious buds that develop on the roots figure 54 the black locust robinia pseudoacacia is a prolific sucker producer suckers can be cut from the parent root system and transplanted bulbs and similar organs vegetative structures termed either bulbs corms tubers tuberous roots or rhizomes are modified stem or root tissues that store food during dormant periods seasonal perennials like tulips daffodils crocuses and gladioli exemplify these structures the organs form as part of the root system and are easily collected and separated by propagators figure 55 layering in layering roots develop on a stem that is still attached to the parent plant runners are characteristic of naturally layered plants some plants root better this way because food production and water uptake are not reduced or totally severed as when a cutting is taken the rubber plant ficus elastica and many temperate woody ornamentals can be reproduced by layering there are various ways of layering plants depending on the species involved in general the stem is partially severed a rooting hormone is applied and the cut stem is buried in soil or wrapped in a cool moist medium promotive of root formation figure 56 the illustration shows a peat pot split and wrapped in plastic around the cut stem using moistened sphagnum moss is equally effective and probably more common once new roots have formed within the plastic cocoon the new plant can be separated from the parent and potted for continued growth cuttings when segments of roots leaves or stems are cut off a plant and placed under appropriate environmental conditions new shoots and roots form and eventually a new plant is produced propagation by stem cuttings is the most common means of reproducing plants asexually chrysanthemums geraniums and woody shrubs are among the many important horticultural plants perpetuated by cutting propagation figure 57 grafting when grafting with compatible species the upper portion of one plant can be joined with the lower portion of a different plant and they will fuse to become a single new plant expressing characteristics of the two from which it originated roses are commonly grafted to produce a plant having showy flowers and a hardy root system many woody ornamentals are propagated by grafting figure 58 budding this is a type of grafting in which buds of one plant are implanted into the stem of another compatible species roses are the major ornamentals utilizing this propagative technique figure 59 fruit and nut trees are the most common plants grafted in this manner division of the crown as shrubs and herbaceous perennials mature the crown junction of the roots and shoots enlarges and can be divided into rootshoot units that will then grow into separate plants even in plants whose shoots die back at the end of the growing season the crown divisions will regenerate plants as long as adventitious shoot buds exist figure 510 tissue culture small sections of meristematic shoot tissue or callus tissue are surgically removed from the parent plant placed into balanced nutrient media and grown under carefully controlled environmental conditions figure 511 through mitosis and tissue differentiation new plants result that are copies of the plant from which they originated orchids and foliage plants are commonly reproduced in this way a major benefit of this method is to ensure that the propagated plants are diseasefree by culturing with active apical meristem meristmatic tissue such tissue usually grows faster than any diseasecausing agents that might be infecting a parent plant and that could be transported into the new plants through other propagative techniques tissue culture is only successful if done under aseptic conditions apomictic embryos in certain cases an embryo can be produced without meiosis and fertilization the resulting seed is thus asexually produced several grass species propagate in this manner but it is of greater significance with fruit crops than with ornamentals,plant reproduction allows plants to duplicate themselves and can be divided into sexual and asexual methods in sexual reproduction plants produce seeds through gamete fusion combining genetic material and leading to diverse traits such as larger blooms or stronger stems this process involves meiosis where chromosomes halve and recombine during fertilization to form a zygote selfpollinating plants produce offspring with nearly identical traits while crosspollinating ones introduce variability asexual reproduction preserves genetic consistency producing clones of the parent plant through mitosis a cell division process that avoids recombination common techniques include cuttings stem or root sections grow into new plants under specific conditions layering roots form on a stem still attached to the parent as seen with many woody plants grafting and budding combining parts of two plants to enhance desired traits common in ornamental and fruit species division splitting mature plant crowns into smaller units that grow independently tissue culture using small tissue sections in controlled environments to produce diseasefree plants some plants like grasses can produce seeds asexually via apomictic embryos bypassing fertilization entirely and preserving unique traits across generations
plant improvement no study of plant reproduction is complete without some discussion of how plants change and improve through the years the essence of vegetative reproduction is that there is no change that is each new plant is exactly like the parent plant although this may be desirable in the short term it would be detrimental in the long run if species were unable to change to respond to new environmental conditions such changes can only occur through sexual reproduction or spontaneous mutation when the sexual reproduction process is controlled by the deliberate actions of human beings plant breeding results and a specialized science plant genetics takes effect plant genetics is a young science tracing its origin to gregor mendel an austrian whose work with the common garden pea in 1865 began the understanding of how and why plants change weighty texts and entire university courses are devoted to the subject of genetics it is not the intent here to explain the intricacies of plant improvement rather it is hoped that you will gain a basic understanding of a science and specialized technology integral to the longterm improvement of ornamentals and other crop plants the physiological activities of each cell tissue organ and total plant are the result of biochemical reactions these reactions are driven by enzymes that are synthesized from coded information carried on the chromosomes in each cells nucleus each enzymatic effect is controlled by an individual gene the determiners of heredity located on the chromosomes genes are part of the deoxyribonucleic acid dna portion of the chromosome as the chromosome duplicates during meiosis the genes and the dna also duplicate this duplication determines the transmission of hereditary features the contribution of gregor mendel a look at the work of gregor mendel provides an appreciation of his contribution to learning along with a basic introduction to the study of plant improvement gregor mendel was an augustinian monk who lived from 1822 to 1884 throughout his adult life mendel enjoyed plants and entertained a curiosity about how their hereditary features were transmitted from generation to generation prior to his studies scholars accepted the idea that inheritance in plants was not predictable and that the characteristics of the parents just blended together in the offspring according to that mistaken concept the fusion of gametes from a sixfoottall parent and a twofoottall parent might produce a fourfoottall offspring as though inheritance resembled mathematical averaging since such results were not the case mendel looked for other explanations he worked with the common garden pea and selected two strains that were notably different in height one grew to a mature height of six or seven feet and the other to a mature height of one or two feet he declined to study other differences between the parents isolating for his observations only the height variable he crossbred selected parents carrying out the pollinations under carefully controlled conditions and keeping precise records of the offspring that resulted when mendel allowed two tall parents to selfpollinate the offspring were all tall these first generation offspring are termed f1 when f1 generation plants were then allowed to selfpollinate the second generation f2 offspring were divided with threefourths of the plants tall and onefourth of the plants short in neither generation f1 nor f2 were there any plants of intermediate or average height explaining mendels observations with modern terminology it is now recognized that factors such as height are controlled by genes and that these genes occur in pairs as with short and tall on homologous chromosomes when the sexual gametes are formed the paired genes separate to illustrate the genes for tall and short are usually represented as t and t respectively the homologous chromosomes from the original tall plants are therefore represented as tt those from the original short plants are represented as tt the chromosomes and genes separate during meiosis and the resulting haploid gametes each contain a single gene for height they recombine after pollination to create a diploidal tt offspring figure 512 since all the f1 generation mature as tall pea plants despite containing a gene for shortness the t gene is regarded as dominant and the t gene as recessive the phenotype external appearance of mendels plants was the same tall whether the genotype genetic composition was tt or tt the selffertilization of the f1 generation plants produces a 31 ratio of tall to short plants three tall to one short figure 513 a simpler method of diagramming the crosses is shown in table 52 the genotype of one parent is written across the top and the genotype of the other parent is written down the side by multiplying the letter symbols down and across the possible types of offspring and their predicted ratio result the example of mendels work just described refers to parents that differ in only one characteristic a cross between such parents is termed a monohybrid cross when two or more independently inherited characters distinguish the parents a cross is termed dihybrid gregor mendel selected a parent pea plant that always produced yellow round seeds when selfpollinated another parent always produced green wrinkled seeds when selfpollinated when the two plants were crosspollinated the f1 offspring all produced yellow round seeds he deduced that the yellow and round traits were dominant over the green and wrinkled traits using y and y to represent yellow and green and r and r to represent round and wrinkled the two original parents can be represented as yyrr and yyrr the f1 plants would be yyrr heterozygous for the two characteristics since the characteristics exist on two different chromosomes the two pairs of genes separate independently of each other the result is that f1 parents produce four types of haploid gametes during meiosis yr yr yr and yr when f1 plants are selfpollinated the checkerboard method of predicting how the gametes will combine corresponds closely with what mendel actually observed nine yellow and round three yellow and wrinkled three green and round and one green and wrinkled refer to table 53 as selfpollination continues the proportion of homozygous offspring increases that is why selfpollinating plants usually breed true in animals especially humans selfpollination or inbreeding may be detrimental because a homozygous offspring manifesting recessive harmful genes is likely to result with plants the inbreeding technique can be used to produce homozygous offspring that exhibit desirable recessive genes the great danger inherent to a simplified discussion of a complex subject is that readers will assume the limited information is all they need to know therefore it bears repeating that what is sought here is not substantive insight into the science of genetics or the technology of plant breeding but rather a basic understanding of the kind of knowledge needed for plant improvement the work of gregor mendel illustrates many of the principles on which the science of genetics is based but the science continues to grow and knowledge to accumulate a few more concepts are worth mentioning dominance does not exist between all gene pairs f1 may appear intermediate in a characteristic compared to the parents for example a red flowering parent and a white flowering parent may produce an f1 offspring having pink flowers some plants are selfsterile or unable to selfpollinate and produce seed crossfertilization gains importance in such species and results in increasing the number of variations in the offspring certain genes are termed lethal their presence on the chromosome of a plant will kill the plant for example plants need chlorophyll to photosynthesize if a lethal recessive gene for no chlorophyll appears as a homozygous individual the plant will eventually die when inbred plant species are crossed the f1 hybrid generation may have qualities superior to those of either parent the phenomenon is known as hybrid vigor it can be predicted and created by selective breeding but its cause is not clearly understood mutations mutations are spontaneous changes in the genetic structure of a plant they occur in nature as accidents resulting from something that prevents the dna of a chromosome from replicating exactly during meiosis the cause of the incomplete replication may or may not be identifiable but once done the new plant is different in some way from what was expected most significant is that the difference is now part of the genetic code of the new plant making it heritable mutations may also be induced by plant breeders using chemical or radiation methods to create new plants possessing desired features industry applications plant breeders apply their knowledge of genetics and their ability to influence plant reproduction to develop new varieties that meet a need the nature of the need is defined and described by the people who will then produce the new plants in quantity working in universities and in private research centers around the world plant breeders attempt to create plants that will solve problems improved resistance to pests drought or herbicides are typical benefits sought through breeding programs other breeders may seek to change a species of plant to make its harvest easier or its flowers larger or its foliage more glossy because plant breeding is expensive and time consuming and not totally predictable time cannot be wasted on changes that are not sought by growers or consumers,plant improvement relies on introducing variations through sexual reproduction and mutations allowing adaptation and diversity within species that might otherwise remain genetically unchanged through asexual methods the study of plant genetics began with gregor mendels experiments with pea plants demonstrating that traits like height are controlled by paired genes on chromosomes with dominant genes eg t for tall often masking recessive ones eg t for short mendels monohybrid and dihybrid crosses showed predictable inheritance patterns helping scientists understand how traits are passed to offspring without blending in controlled breeding plant breeders use these principles to develop plants with advantageous traits like disease resistance larger fruits or specific colors optimizing plants for agricultural and consumer demands hybrid vigor describes the enhanced qualities of hybrid offspring from diverse parent lines a phenomenon breeders use to produce stronger or more resilient plants mutationsnatural or induced through chemical or radiation methodscreate heritable traits that further diversify plants and may yield novel benefits while selective breeding is complex and timeconsuming plant improvement through genetic understanding enables the development of resilient and desirable plant varieties suited to evolving environmental and agricultural needs
plant injuries and their causes anything that impairs the healthy growth and maturation of a plant may be regarded as an injurious agent injuries may be natural resulting from the interaction of plants with the many components of the earths environment they may also be unnatural resulting from the activities of humans for example when heavy snow breaks a limb of a tree or an insect chews holes in a leaf those injuries could have occurred without any action by people however when a plant suffers from excess fertilization or from being sprayed with a harsh chemical then the injuries can be attributed to errors by humans when viewed in this manner many of the conditions that we regard as injuries are just normal interactions between the plants animals and other components of the natural world it is when people place value on plants for reasons of their aesthetic appearance andor economic importance that those interactions are labeled as injuries and regarded as undesirable and problematic sometimes scientists and others do not agree on the specific categorization of an injury is it a disease an insect problem an environmental condition or should they all be included under one umbrella term such as disease regardless of the categorization scientists and horticulture practitioners agree that injuries to plants can be caused by both biotic living and abiotic nonliving agents in addition those agents may be either infectious capable of spreading from plant to plant or noninfectious not capable of spreading as examples if a lawnmower gouges the bark of a tree the cause would be abiotic and noninfectious other adjacent trees would likely not experience the same injury however if a plant in the center of a crowded greenhouse bench developed mildew it is probable that the plants around it and perhaps throughout the entire greenhouse would eventually contract the same mildew injury the cause would be both biotic and infectious reviewing table 61 will help in distinguishing among the many causes of plant injuries to fully understand the table several additional terms need explanation as described above an agent that is infectious is capable of spreading from plant to plant such agents are usually living within the host plant and are using the plant as a source of nourishment those agents are collectively termed plant pathogens pathogens are biotic and infectious and include the bacteria fungi nematodes viruses viroids mollicutes and some parasitic plants many forms of these pathogens as well as insects and weed seeds will persist in the soil where host plants are growing or even collect on the surface of the plants awaiting the opportunity to infect them the presence of injurious agents on or in the nearby environment of desirable plants is termed infestation the agents are regarded as infestious and the plants andor their environment would be infested the parasitic insects fungi bacteria viruses and nematodes as well as the weeds are so distinctive as biotic entities that the studies of them have evolved into specialized branches of science entomology is the study of insects is the study of bacteria bacteriology is the study of fungi mycology is the study of viruses virology is the study of nematodes nematology is the study of plant diseases their causes and their plant pathology controls is the study of weeds and their control weed science insects regarded by nearly all biologists as the most interesting economically significant and certainly most prolific of all members of the animal kingdom insects are a study in contrasts for millions of years insects have benefited and beleaguered human civilization essential as scavengers pollinators and reducers of organic matter to earth mold insects also despoil food crops invade our homes attack our bodies and those of other animals and lay waste our agricultural products insects are primarily terrestrial animals that range from the arctic to the antarctic and from the depths of the earth to the mountain tops they constitute over twothirds of all the animal species on the planet and are surpassed only by microbes in sheer numbers of individuals the classification of insects in the animal kingdom the major divisions are known as phyla singular phylum the phylum arthropoda contains the class insecta or the insects other classes of arthropoda include the crayfish spiders centipedes ticks millipedes mites and scorpions certain of the noninsect arthropoda are important as plant pests especially the mites but the plant pests that represent the greatest numbers and do the greatest amount of economic damage are the true insects anatomy of insects combining the characteristics of all members of the phylum arthropoda with those unique to the class insecta the external anatomy of insects features jointed appendages bilateral symmetry an exoskeleton three body divisions head thorax and abdomen six legs attached to the thorax wings usually two pairs attached to the thorax one pair of antennae attached to the head simple and compound eyes reproductive organs in the abdomen air tubes for respiration the external anatomy of a typical insect is exemplified by the grasshopper figure 61 several of the anatomical features warrant special mention exoskeleton the exoskeleton is the hard protective covering of the insects body it functions like our more familiar endoskeleton serving as the point of attachment for muscles it also protects the softer tissues inside the exoskeleton has helped ensure the survival of insects through centuries of evolution and environmental stress excessive moisture severe drying and enemies of all types are thwarted by it the exoskeleton is composed principally of chitin a nitrogenous polysaccharide compound that resists water alcohol acids and alkalis head the head bears the mouthparts eyes and antennae sensory perception is the function of the antennae and they are one of the major distinguishing features in the identification of insects following are nine of the more common types of insect antennae figure 62 1 comblike pectinate 2 featherlike plumose 3 tapering to a point setaceous 4 sawlike serrate 5 expanded thin plates at the tips lamellate 6 enlarged at the tip and bearing a bristle aristate 7 clublike clavate 8 threadlike uniform the entire length filiform 9 beadlike moniliform the type of mouthpart is also highly important in identifying insects and equally so in selecting a means of controlling them the mouthparts of insects determine how they feed on plants and the symptoms of injury that are manifested these are the most common types of mouthparts figure 63 the mouth can tear chew and grind food examples chewing grasshopper and beetles the mouthpart is like a coiled tube it is dipped into a siphoning liquid food which is then drawn in examples moths and butterflies two spongelike structures collect the liquid food and sponging move it to the insects food canal example housefly the mouthpart rasps breaks the surface of the raspingsucking plant then sucks the sap that exudes from the wound example thrips the mouth punctures the epidermis of plants then piercingsucking sucks the sap examples aphids scale leafhoppers the insect is able to tear and chew the plant tissue chewinglapping as well as draw up released liquid through a temporary food tube example bees legs the legs project from the thorax they and the wings propel insects in a variety of ways they vary as widely as antennae and mouthparts figure 64 wings the wings also arise from the thorax unlike the legs the number six of which is part of the very definition of an insect the number of wings can vary most adult insects have two pairs some have only one pair and still other insects have no wings the venation pattern of the wings is a factor in the identification of insects digestive system the digestive system is a tube that extends from the mouth of the insect to the anus it is divided into three parts the foreintestine midintestine and hindintestine food is digested in the midintestine respiratory system the respiratory system combines expansion and contraction of the abdomen with diffusion to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide in the cells and tissues of the insect insects breathe through small openings along the side of the thorax and abdomen termed spiracles the spiracles open into tracheae tubes that carry essential oxygen directly to the cells and tissues carbon dioxide passes out of the tissues by a reversal of the process nervous system the nervous system is made up of groups of specialized cells called ganglia singular ganglion and nerve fibers that join the ganglia to other parts of the insects body the insects brain is simply an enlarged ganglion located in the head reproductive system the reproductive system is located in the abdomen reproduction normally requires mating between a male and female although some insects are incapable of reproduction still others are able to reproduce through parthenogenesis which allows eggs to develop even though they have not been fertilized in addition to the reproductive organs common to most animals insects possess specialized organs for mating and depositing eggs the male insect may have special structures for clasping the female the female has an ovipositor an organ for laying eggs growth and change of insects no members of the animal kingdom transform more dramatically during their development than insects the homely caterpillar becomes the graceful butterfly the grub worm in last summers lawn becomes the june bug buzzing around the porch light this year the changes in insect form as they grow are termed metamorphosis some insects have no metamorphosis going from the earliest stage to the adult form looking the same except for increasing size others have complete metamorphosis and include four stages of development egg larva pupa and adult still other insects have some form of metamorphosis that includes a nymph stage but not the larva or pupa stages they are said to possess gradual or incomplete metamorphosis in those insects with a nymph stage the young insect usually bears some resemblance to the adult into which it will develop at first the resemblance may be slight but as the insect grows it passes through a series of growth stages called instars as it grows the insect must shed its confining exoskeleton molt to permit continued growth into the next instar stage each molt and new instar brings the insect closer to the adult form an insects life begins as an egg the eggs may hatch inside the female and are termed ovoviviparous or they may be laid by the female in large or small clusters for later hatching oviparous the eggs are usually deposited near a food supply since the insects that hatch can move only short distances but possess insatiable appetites the female insect may lay as few as one egg or as many as several thousand daily depending on the species there is little evidence of a maternal instinct among insects once the eggs are laid the female leaves them to hatch and fend for themselves most insects undergo a complete metamorphosis including the larva and pupa forms the larval stage finds the insect in a wormlike form and possessing a chewing mouthpart figure 65 in this form the insect does little more than eat and grow much of the economic devastation wrought by insects against crops results from this larval stage when larval maturity is reached the larva ceases feeding and seeks a protected location for its next stage of growth the pupal stage the pupa is totally helpless and physically inactive figure 66 however while in this stage the insect undergoes remarkable alterations in its physiology and morphology it is during the pupal stage that the transformation from wormlike larva to adult occurs legless forms develop legs wings develop where none were mouthparts change from chewing to another type the miracle of metamorphosis is one of the true wonders of the natural world figure 67 whatever the type of metamorphosis the adult stage is eventually reached the most essential function of the adult insect is reproduction some insects die soon after mating or laying eggs other insects live for a long time in the adult stage the majority of insects are of greatest economic significance in their nonadult stages since that is when the greatest feeding and crop destruction occurs,plant injuries are caused by biotic living and abiotic nonliving factors which may be infectious spreadable or noninfectious injuries can be natural like insect feeding or result from human actions such as excess fertilization biotic agents known as pathogens include bacteria fungi nematodes viruses and some parasitic plants while abiotic injuries stem from environmental factors like extreme weather or physical damage insects significant biotic agents have distinct anatomical features like a hard exoskeleton jointed appendages and three body divisions head thorax abdomen they undergo different types of metamorphosis during their life cycle transitioning from egg to larva pupa and adult stages where larvae often cause the most crop damage studying these factors helps manage plant health and reduce damage from natural and humancaused injuries key points plant injuries caused by biotic living and abiotic nonliving agents infectious vs noninfectious agents pathogens biotic agents like bacteria fungi nematodes viruses insects major plant pests with anatomy including an exoskeleton jointed appendages insect metamorphosis egg larva pupa adult significant economic damage occurs in the larval stage of insects
plant diseases despite our best efforts at control the united states loses an estimated 15 to 20 percent of crop productivity each year due to plant diseases history is laden with accounts of starvation and pestilence resulting from crop failures that were themselves the result of widespread infection by plant pathogens plant diseases such as the potato blight in ireland altered the destiny of an entire country in our country chestnut blight and dutch elm disease have all but eliminated two important native north american tree species from the moment it begins as a seed cutting or other propagative structure the plant is susceptible to injury and death from hundreds of pathogenic agents some affect the plant in its early stages of growth others are a threat to the maturing plant some pathogens affect the flowers while leaving the foliage unimpaired others bother only the fruit still others injure any and all parts of the plant to attain a basic understanding of plant diseases you need to be familiar with both the causal agents pathogens and the diseases they create in their host plants plant pathogens while many plant pathologists include the injuries induced by abiotic causes in their broadest consideration of plant disease what will be explained here are the biotic parasitic causal agents each type of injurious agent is a parasite incapable of producing its own food and relying upon a host plant to provide its nourishment the most important causes of disease in plants are the bacteria fungi viruses and nematodes also important but of less significance in terms of the sheer number of diseases they create are the viroids and mollicutes all are microscopic in size reproduce prolifically and have a remarkable ability to survive following is a summary of the important characteristics of the pathogen groups bacteria a members of the kingdom protista b nonchlorophyllous c singlecelled prokaryotes d three body forms spherical coccus rodshaped bacillus and spiralshaped spirillus figure 68 only the bacillus form causes plant diseases e reproduction by simple cell division f some forms survive unfavorable conditions as hardcoated spores termed endospores g some forms propel themselves by means of whiplike appendages termed flagella bacteria may have a single flagellum at one end monotrichous more than one flagellum at one end lophotrichous or flagella all over the cell peritrichous figure 69 h all pathogenic species of bacteria are classified within six genera 1 pseudomonas 2 xanthomonas 3 erwinia 4 corynebacterium 5 agrobacterium 6 streptomyces mollicutes a smaller in size than most bacteria b the smallest freeliving selfreplicating forms of life c nonchlorophyllous prokaryotes d lack a cell wall e lack the flagella of bacteria they move by gliding and twisting f classified in the kingdom protista two types are known 1 phytoplasmas 2 spiroplasmas fungi a members of the kingdom fungi b nonchlorophyllous nonmotile eukaryotes c their vegetative body called a thallus ranges in size from a single cell to a threadlike multicellular structure termed a mycelium the individual threadlike filaments making up the mycelium are hyphae the functions of the hyphae are to absorb nutrients from the host plant reproduce the fungus by formation of sexual and asexual fruiting structures and survive adverse conditions figure 610 d reproduction by formation of spores e classification is on the basis of life cycle specifically how the vegetative and reproductive organs develop f fungi are placed in five classes by most mycologists 1 chytridiomycetes 2 zygomycetes 3 ascomycetes 4 basidiomycetes 5 deuteromycetes a number of nuclear changes occur during the life cycle of the fungi figure 611 fungi that reproduce sexually have haploid nuclei containing half the normal number of chromosomes during the vegetative gametophytic stage the sexual cells gametes form during the haploid phase the fusion of two compatible gametes occurs during plasmogamy marking the beginning of the diploid phase which brings together two sets of matching chromosomes when the two sexual nuclei actually fuse the stage of caryogamy is achieved the result of the fertilization is a zygote the zygote eventually becomes the organ in which reduction and division meiosis occurs following meiosis haploid spores are formed which germinate to form the vegetative thallus during the gametophytic stage additional spores may be produced asexually these are termed conidia singular conidiospore each conidiospore is capable of germinating and forming a new thallus with many pathogenic fungi the number of asexual conidia produced far surpasses the number of sexual spores produced making them the most significant pathogenic form viruses a their kingdom categorization is uncertain evidence suggests they are an entirely different life form b nonchlorophyllous c composed of nucleic acids and proteins d among the smallest of the pathogens visible only with an electron microscope e plant viruses appear most commonly in two morphological forms a long narrow tubelike rod and an isometrical polyhedron shape with many sides of equal length f reproduce only within a living host g no natural classification system is yet developed instead viruses are grouped together on the basis of the symptoms they create in their hosts their physical and chemical properties the insects that transmit them and other qualities viroids a the least understood of the plant pathogens b nonchlorophyllous c much smaller than a virus d composed of single strands of rna and lack the protein coat of viruses e they replicate themselves inside the nuclei of infected plant cells f their exact mechanism of pathogenicity is still unknown but the impact of their infection on a host plant can be severe nematodes a members of the animal kingdom b feed on both plants and animals nearly a thousand species attack plant parts those that complete most of their life cycle within a host plant are termed endoparasitic those whose life cycle occurs outside the host plant are ectoparasitic c plant nematodes average about 1 millimeter in length d body wall usually transparent with an outer covering termed a cuticle e feeding apparatus consists of mouthparts equipped with a buccal spear used to puncture the host cell to withdraw cellular fluids f favored by light sandy soils with a high average temperature g life cycle generally simple the females lay eggs that hatch to form larvae these larvae grow and pass through a series of four molts finally reaching the adult stage figures 612a and 612b slugs and snails a members of the animal kingdom b macroscopic in size c nocturnal feeders on plant leaves and stems d slugs lack the shell that is common to snails e leave a slimy trail on the soil surface as they move parasitic seed plants a weakly chlorophyllous but usually incapable of meeting their own nutritional needs b connect to the vascular tissue of chlorophyllous higher plants c varying levels of parasitism epiphytic make their own food but need structural support such as spanish moss semiparasitic make their own food using water and nutrients absorbed from the host plant such as mistletoe indian warrior fully parasitic incapable of photosynthesizing and totally dependent on the host plant for all nutritional needs such as dodder relationships between plants and pathogens plant diseases do not arise spontaneously there must be a causal agent the pathogen in the vicinity of a susceptible plant the host the pathogen must be in a form that will grow and develop when transferred to the host the infectious form of the pathogen is termed inoculum the inoculum is transferred to the host by an agent of dissemination there it must arrive at an appropriate site of infection with environmental conditions favorable to the pathogen if a parasitic relationship between the pathogen and the host is to develop following are examples of these new terms some agents of dissemination are insects splashing water and rainfall wind animals including humans equipment and tools some forms of inoculum are spores of fungi bacterial ooze a concentrated mass of bacteria virus particles strands of hyphae some sites of infection are stomates cuts wounds blossoms roots fruit the precise nature of the relationship that develops between the host and the pathogen is determined by the type of parasitism obligate parasites these pathogens can exist only on a living host these irritants cannot survive on a living obligate saprophytes host only on nonliving matter an obligate saprophyte cannot be considered a pathogen this pathogen is normally a parasite growing facultative saprophyte on a living host however it can survive on nonliving matter and as such can be grown on nonliving agar for laboratory study this pathogen is normally a saprophyte growing faculative parasite on nonliving matter however it can grow as a parasite on plants in so doing it must kill the host cells with secreted enzymes before it is able to feed on them faculative parasites can survive in the soil for long periods of time feeding on nonliving organic matter as long as the inoculum is only on the host the plant is termed infested once the pathogen penetrates the hosts tissues the plant is termed infected disease begins when the host responds to the injurious presence of the pathogen symptoms of injured plants responses to pathogenic irritants and insects are termed symptoms some symptoms are common to numerous insects and diseases other symptoms are almost unique to certain irritanthost relationships the sum of all the symptoms expressed by a host from the time it is initially infected until it either recovers or dies is known as the symptom complex infection of a plant by pests is not a static condition the symptoms expressed early in the infection may be quite different than those expressed later for any one irritant however the symptom complex is usually specific to diagnose a disease or insect problem correctly requires recognizing the specific changes each major pathogen or insect can create in a host symptoms may be influenced by an assortment of factors including the species of the host the environment the quantity of inoculum or insects and the stage of development of the pathogen or insect furthermore symptoms can result from other abiotic causes such as a damaging environment improperly applied chemicals animal injury and mechanical damage for this reason it is often necessary to isolate and identify the specific agent of plant injury or to consider other possible sources of irritation before the cause of plant symptoms can be established while specific symptoms cover a wide range often separated only by subtleties collectively they can be grouped into major categories that permit description and comparison figure 613 wilting plants may wilt from lack of water if such a symptom is environmental in origin the plant will recover when watered if insects attack a plants root system or pathogens destroy the xylem tissue the wilting may be permanent when fungi invade the tender stem tissue of a young seedling dampingoff develops the plant wilts and drops over to die color changes resulting from the destruction of chlorophyll color changes may be localized spots rings lesions or widespread through the plant lack of light turns a plant yellow in a condition termed etiolation when the plant turns yellow but does not lack light the symptom is termed chlorosis chlorosis is probably the most common of all color changes it can be caused by insects pathogens or environmental problems rotting rotting results from a destruction of the host cells that causes a release of the cellular fluids it may be accompanied by a strong often foul odor rots may be dry or soft and occur in the roots leaves stems buds or fruits they are usually the result of plant diseases or freezing death of tissue when tissue becomes desiccated dried out and dies it usually turns brown or black and is said to be necrotic the dead tissue or necrosis may be localized on leaves as spots or centered in young buds it may also be extensive encompassing entire branches as in blights insects pathogens or environmental factors can cause necrosis it ranks with chlorosis in the frequency of its presence it is often the final symptom in the symptom complex dwarfing all or part of a plant can be reduced in size as a result of pathogens especially viruses and viroids insects and nematodes dwarfing may result from the reduction of water uptake at a time when new tissue is expanding insects or nematodes in the root system of a plant may create such dwarfing which results from a reduction in cell size hypotrophy or number hypoplasia hypotrophic or hypoplastic reactions by the plant can result in local or overall dwarfing both conditions can occur simultaneously increase in size plant parts may become malformed in response to insect or pathogenic irritants as cells increase in size hypertrophy or in number hyperplasia symptoms are expressed as galls witches brooms swollen roots abnormal shoot growth scabs and fasciations tunneling insects may bore into plant trunks chew their way between the upper and lower epidermis of leaves and tunnel up and down the stems borers and leaf miners commonly create such injury in plants holes leaves filled with holes are symptomatic of both insect and pathogenic causes insects usually cause holes by feeding on the leaf tissue when caused by pathogen activity the holes are preceded by necrotic lesions and spots that represent dead cells as the tissue dies in these localized areas the necrotic areas drop out creating the holes hundreds of combinations and variations of symptoms can result from the many possible causal agents reactions of individual host plants and unpredictable modifications caused by the environment if the quick and accurate diagnosis of what is troubling a particular host plant sounds difficult be assured it is,plant diseases affecting about 1520 of us crops yearly are caused by various pathogens including bacteria fungi viruses viroids nematodes and parasitic plants each type of pathogen has unique characteristics bacteria are singlecelled and reproduce by cell division fungi spread via spores and viruses replicate only within living cells nematodes are microscopic worms that puncture plant cells to feed while parasitic plants draw nutrients from hosts sometimes entirely dependent on them infection begins when pathogens in their infective form called inoculum reach a susceptible host through carriers like insects wind water or human activity infected plants exhibit distinctive symptoms collectively known as a symptom complex key symptoms include wilting often due to root damage chlorosis yellowing from chlorophyll loss necrosis dead tissue often brown or black dwarfing reduced growth due to inhibited water uptake and increased tissue growth such as galls or swellings from hypertrophy symptoms can be specific to each pathogenhost relationship and may change over time influenced by environmental factors and host plant type identifying plant diseases accurately requires understanding these diverse symptoms pathogen types and their transmission methods to ensure effective management and prevention strategies
weeds no discussion of the pests affecting ornamental plants is complete without considering the weeds a weed may be defined as a plant having no positive economic value andor growing in a place where it is not desired unlike insects and pathogens weeds do not derive their sustenance directly from other plants as parasites instead weeds compete with other plants for the materials both need to grow and thrive in addition weeds often serve as alternate hosts providing sites for the overwintering of insects or pathogenic inoculum some fungi need weed species in which to produce one or more spore forms as part of a complex life cycle in summation weeds affect ornamental plants adversely in the following ways as competitors for space nutrients water light heat energy and co2 by shading crop plants further inhibiting their growth as alternate hosts for insects and pathogens by crowding due to excessive vegetation and by the vining manner of some weeds through infestation of the soil with large quantities of seeds and root stock that permit proliferation of the weeds over many seasons by production of chemical exudates that inhibit germination andor normal growth of crop plants classification of weeds being plants weeds share the binomial nomenclature of botanical classification all are classified into families genera species and varieties also like other plants weeds are classified in other ways their place of growth may classify them as aquatic or terrestrial their leaf type may classify them as grasses or broad leaved they may also be categorized as herbaceous or woody or as annuals biennials or perennials these terms were defined in chapter 2 the origin and dissemination of weeds even when the climate is hot and dry or the soil infertile weeds seem to proliferate they can appear in a raised greenhouse bench or beside a containerized street tree they are as apt to be found in a manicured lawn as in a cultivated flower bed frustrated gardeners through the centuries have pondered how the weedy pests invade their crops historically the origin and distribution of weeds in an area have paralleled migration and colonization by early settlers many of our north american weeds came from europe no doubt there were weed seeds aboard the mayflower certainly the fortyniners carried a good assortment of weeds with them aboard their wagons as they rolled westward within a local area weeds are distributed as seeds or other reproductive parts such as stolons roots bulbs rhizomes or tubers cultivated soil is likely to have a greater number and diversity of weeds than uncultivated land due to the dissemination of propagative parts by cultivating tools many agents of dissemination account for the dispersal of weeds they may be natural or artificial some natural agents of dissemination are flowing water wind birds livestock and other animals forceful dispersal of seeds from pods or capsules some artificial agents of dissemination are cultivating tools vehicles clothing transplanting desired plants from one area to another and moving weeds with them gardeners who work manure from the local stockyard into their soil may be planting weed seeds from fodder that originated far away landscapers who use inexpensive seed to develop a lawn may be planting more weed seeds than quality grasses greenhouse growers who permit the maturation of a few oxalis under the greenhouse benches will soon find them growing above the benches as their pods split dehisce and forcefully eject seeds over a considerable distance homeowners who pull a wild morning glory or field bindweed from the shrub bed leave behind segments of the root system destined to reproduce the plant vegetatively a hundredfold weeds have evolved to survive they are prolific seed producers with some species capable of producing more than a million seeds per parent plant as with nonweed plants some weed seeds germinate quickly and easily while others remain dormant longer weed seeds are usually distributed throughout a soils profile so turning over the earth may bring to the surface seeds that have been buried and dormant for several years weed seeds and fruits usually benefit from a morphological development that ensures their successful dissemination figure 614 assorted appendages that catch the wind like sails or latch onto the clothing or fur of passing humans or animals provide transport over long distances hard seedcoats allow safe passage of the seeds through the digestive tract of birds and livestock to be deposited with the manure some weed seeds are even able to plant themselves their wedgelike appendages respond to alternating moisture levels in the soil and air by literally burrowing into the loose soil each change in the moisture state thrusts the seed deeper until it is completely buried other causes of injury insects diseases and weeds are collectively the major causes of injury to plants however there are other causes of injury some biological and others nonbiological see table 61 many home gardeners have spent time pondering the cause of chewed leaves and stems on their plants when no insects were to be found had they made their inspection at night or checked under nearby rocks or leaf litter during the day they would have found the culprits slugs and snails are nocturnal active at night preferring a cool moist resting area during the daytime of the two slugs do the most damage finding their way into residential landscapes production fields and even greenhouse benches they leave behind a trail of slimy exudates as they move so their presence is easily detected still other biotic causes of plant injury or destruction can be traced to birds rabbits rodents deer and other animals that feed on plants above and below ground rabbits can decimate a bulb display feeding on the tender foliage or buds as they emerge through the soil in the early spring rodents can destroy the vascular system of young trees and shrubs by chewing off the bark at the plants base a condition termed girdling deer can wipe out an entire block of nursery plants or devastate a landscape planting by winter grazing abiotic injuries may be environmental such as nutrient deficiencies or excesses or unfavorable climate they may also be cultural such as lawnmower or snowplow injury or vandalism with the exception of a greenhouse environment there are few options available to avoid these types of injuries to plants compared to the insects pathogens and weeds their economic impact is small but if yours is the nursery crop ruined by grazing deer or the spring floral display destroyed by hungry rabbits or the manicured lawn or fairway rutted by a thoughtless motorcyclist the damage is real and just as costly the control of biotic pests in a text such as this where insects diseases and weeds are treated in terms of their general effect on plants a discussion of their control must be equally general specific products and formulations used in the control of specific pests can fill volumes fundamental to the training of professional horticulturists however is a solid understanding of why and when certain control measures can be effective against pests the technology of pest control may change over time but the principles that direct it will not the purpose of pest control is to reduce the damage that can result from an injurious agent damage can be either quantitative or qualitative with quantitative damage all or part of the host plant is destroyed by the antagonistic agent with qualitative damage the host suffers a loss of appearance and sale value damage also can be to land and equipment land left unusable by a longlived soilborne pathogen can be considered damaged as can equipment that depreciates in value without maximum use because of pest presence in a crop in seeking and comparing control measures a grower must decide what degree of effectiveness is being sought there are three levels of pest control 1 partial control is the most common type when a homeowner sprays shrubs with an allpurpose broadspectrum pesticide the shrubs may still exhibit some symptoms of insects or disease but not as severely as if they had not been sprayed 2 absolute control is total control all symptoms of pest injury are absent 3 profitable control is the level attained when monetary returns on the crop exceed the cost of the control measures partial control is the most common type but profitable control is the type most sought by growers absolute control even when possible is usually too costly to be feasible absolute control may be practical on a noncommercial scale with a single foliage plant in a home or a carefully tended flower bed in the backyard but it seldom exists in commercial practice in determining the potential profitability of a control measure three factors must be considered 1 the value of individual plants can the value of a single crop plant vary greatly the cost of bringing one marigold plant to a saleable state is far less than the cost of one poinsettia or one japanese maple more valuable crop plants warrant more costly control measures 2 a grower may justify the expense the ultimate value of the crop of spraying a field of young sapling trees on the basis of their sale value five years hence 3 some insects or diseases the average loss over a period of years may be troublesome only irregularly however rather than risk a devastating infection a grower may choose to invest in protective control every year to guard against a potential pest outbreak,weeds defined as plants lacking economic value or growing undesirably impact ornamental plants by competing for essential resources like space nutrients water light and co often stunting crop growth unlike parasitic pests weeds do not feed directly on other plants but serve as alternate hosts for harmful insects and pathogens crowd desirable plants release chemical inhibitors that suppress growth and reproduce prolifically through seeds and vegetative structures like stolons bulbs and rhizomes weed species are classified by growth habitat aquatic or terrestrial leaf type grasses or broadleaved and life cycle annual biennial or perennial weed spread is facilitated both naturallythrough water wind and animalsand artificially via cultivation tools vehicles and transplanted soil pests including weeds can cause quantitative damage yield loss and qualitative damage appearance with various levels of control possible partial control where some symptoms remain but are minimized absolute control which eliminates all pest presence but is rarely feasible and profitable control a balance ensuring control costs are less than the crops sale value in commercial practice profitable control is ideal factoring in crop value the crops longterm potential and consistent protection against recurring pest threats
principles of control the control of insects pathogens and weeds depends on how successfully the horticulturist applies one or more of the four basic principles of control exclusion exclusion is the first principle of control it includes all the measures designed to keep a pest from becoming established in an area the area may be a single flat of soil a greenhouse bench a lawn a nursery field a geographic region or even an entire country the measures vary depending on the type of pest the use of pestfree propagative stock is essential in the commercial production of horticultural crops growers must select their sources of supply carefully certain sources have excellent reputations as suppliers of disease and insectfree cuttings and weedfree seed certified seeds and plants are produced under the direction of an agency that provides documentation of their varietal purity viability moisture content and the absence of weed seed insects and pathogens the treatment of propagative material can kill pathogens and insects immersing bulbs in a fungicidal dip treating seeds with heat disinfesting propagative tools and disinfecting cuttings prior to placing them in a propagation bench are all ways to eliminate pests that may be in or on those materials plant quarantines are restrictions on the production movement or very existence of certain plants or plant products in an area the restrictions are imposed by a legislative authority and enforced in an effort to prevent the introduction or spread of a pest in an area eradication eradication is the principle that seeks to remove or eliminate pests that are already in on or near plants in infested areas the measures of eradication attempt to reduce the quantity of pathogenic inoculum insects and their eggs and weeds and their seeds isolating and destroying individual infected plants is timeconsuming and expensive yet it has its place in ornamental plant production in agronomic production it is usually too costly when the removal of infected plants accompanies another job function such as watering or disbudding the cost of control is reduced nevertheless isolating and destroying are more effective for the greenhouse pot crop grower than for the sod producer handpulling and cultivation are directed against weed pests in nursery fields and landscape plantings destruction of alternative hosts such as weeds can also aid pest control the alternate hosts may allow completion of the life cycle of a fungus they may also harbor insect vectors that transmit virus pathogens crop rotation and soil treatments are both methods of eradicating pests that persist in the soil after a nursery crop has been dug from a field a season of planting with a cover crop such as barley or sudangrass will not only improve soil structure but also may allow the cover crop to compete with and smother troublesome weeds soil treatment in the form of either heat or chemicals will eradicate pathogens insects and weeds greenhouse soils are commonly pasteurized by steam heat or hot water available from the heating system figure 615a and b nursery fields and landscape plantings can use chemical eradicants effectively destroying host parts that display evidence of insect or disease damage can reduce the amount of inoculum available for dissemination to nearby hosts as growers tend their crops they have the opportunity to eradicate potentially problematic host parts with little additional expense in time and money removing infested refuse eliminates a site for the overwintering of pathogens or insects it makes a good case for the elimination of fallen leaves and grass clippings from landscapes chemical sprays dusts and drenches are generally the most expensive methods of eradication the products collectively termed eradicants strive to kill the pathogen before it can infect the host kill the insect before it can do much damage or reproduce or kill the weed before or shortly after it emerges chemical control will be discussed in more detail later in the chapter protection protection is the principle of control that sets up a barrier between the host plants and the pests to which they are susceptible it is a shielding endeavor that can be accomplished either through manipulating the plants growing environment or by applying chemicals manipulating the environment is an attempt to create conditions for growth more favorable to the ornamental host than to the pest an obvious example of a shield offering protection is the growth of plants inside a screened area to protect the host from insects and the pathogens they may be carrying other examples of environmental alteration include modifications of the moisture level to avoid creating a prolonged period of heavy moisture in which pathogens can thrive alteration of the soil ph to attain a ph at which the host will grow better than the pest modification of the nutrient level of the soil to produce healthy actively growing plants that are less susceptible to injury by pests and maintenance of cool temperatures to slow the metabolic rate of both hosts and pests thereby reducing the extent of damage when cut flowers are kept in refrigerated storage by a florist the principle of protection is being applied chemical sprays and dusts can be applied to seeds foliage and wounds of plants to place a barrier between the host and the insect or pathogens in this case it is essential that the chemical be applied before the pests arrive it then kills them after they arrive resistance resistance is the fourth principle of control it is an attempt to change the plants morphology andor genotype so that it will suffer less from diseases or insects resistance may originate naturally with a plant population or it may be developed through research by plant hybridizers resistance in plants is not like immunity in animals that is plants do not produce antibodies as animals can instead plant resistance is based either on the physical structure of the plant or cell hypersensitivity for example physical features such as leaf pubescence or thick cuticle may discourage penetration by fungal spores or insects merely by holding them at a distance from potential sites of infection hypersensitivity is the extraordinary reaction of a plant cell to invasion in which the cell dies so quickly that it fails to support further proliferation of the pest resistance is seldom total all plants have some degree of susceptibility and that susceptibility often increases with time the loss or lessening of resistance to a pest does not necessarily mean that the host plant has changed it may mean that the pest has altered in a way that allows it to infect the plant considering the reproductive potential of most pests and the rapidity of their life cycles it is not surprising that resistance especially that developed by artificial hybridization is often overcome by the natural mutation of insects and pathogens pesticides understanding chemical pesticides requires knowing what they are and what they are not what they are is poisonous what they are not is medicinal the belief that pesticides are medicines for ailing plants is misguided and it implies a curative quality that is lacking an infected plant can seldom be cured necrotic tissue cannot regain its life holes chewed in leaves will not restore themselves and galls will not diminish as noted already injury to plants can be quantitative reducing the number of marketable plants andor qualitative rendering the plant unattractive to consumers to be most effective pesticides need to be on the plant before the pathogen or insect invader arrives and to kill it promptly on its arrival these pesticides will be regarded as protectants if the pathogen is already at the site of infection or the insects are already feeding on the plant then the pesticides must kill them immediately such pesticides are termed eradicants thus far the pesticides described are active against the pest only not the host plant chemical control of weeds can become more complicated since the pest like the host is a higher plant with the range of genetic differences narrowed the chemicals must be formulated more precisely the term used to describe all the chemicals that kill plants is herbicides those that kill all green plants are nonselective herbicides those that kill some kinds of plants and not others are selective herbicides these assorted products are also characterized by whether they kill on direct contact with the weed or after the chemical has been incorporated systemically into the weed herbicides may kill the weed before the crop emerges preemergence as the crop emerges at emergence or after the crop has emerged postemergence pesticide product formulations whether the pesticide is a fungicide nematicide insecticide or herbicide it is usually available in several different formulations the choice of formulation is based on the size of the crop area being treated the amount of active ingredient being applied the other materials being applied along with the pesticide such as other pesticides or fertilizers cost safety ease of application following is a summary of product formulations and their characteristics solutions the pesticide dissolves into its oil or water carrier as a homogeneous physical mixture it does not precipitate out so once dissolved the pesticide need not be agitated the pesticide and carrier are in the molecular or ionic state and cannot be separated mechanically emulsifiable concentrates some pesticides are not soluble in water yet must be applied in a water carrier a typical emulsifiable concentrate contains the pesticide a suitable solvent an emulsifier and often a wetting agent sticker or antifoaming agent the concentration of pesticide is usually high so the cost per pound of active ingredient is rather low the elements do not settle out once mixed so they do not need continuous agitation due to their high concentration they can be dangerous to handle wettable powders these pesticides are of limited solubility in water they are combined with dilating agents and surfactants that prevent flocculation of the pesticide particles wettable powders require continuous agitation to ensure uniform coverage they are relatively low in cost easily stored and handled but are hazardous if inhaled or absorbed through the skin granules and pellets these pesticides are formulated as coarse solid particles for easy application the carrier may be sand clay ground corn cobs fertilizer granules or vermiculite no dilution is required since the percentage of active ingredients is lower than in other formulations usually between 4 and 10 percent fumigants these pesticides come in the form of poisonous gases that kill when absorbed or inhaled they are most useful in greenhouses or other enclosed areas where they penetrate into cracks and crevices and into the soil they are often highly toxic dusts these are fine powders containing the active ingredient in low concentrations and mixed with a high percentage of inert carrier material applied dry and directly to the plants dusts leave a visible residue flowable suspensions these are wettable powders not soluble that are suspended in a waterbased carrier material it is usually necessary to agitate the product during application to ensure a uniform coverage gels a gelatinous form of the pesticide gels are commonly used as the formulation inside containers that are to be returned for recycling this is also the formulation common in watersoluble packets waterdispersible granules these are granular formulations that are applied in water they have a low solubility in water so continuous agitation is required during application to ensure even distribution watersoluble packets containing premeasured quantities of gels powders or granules the packets dissolve in water and once mixed require no further agitation during application soaps these are actually oils produced from plants they are applied as sprays by growers and in mist bottles by home gardeners,in horticulture pest control relies on four primary principles exclusion eradication protection and resistance exclusion prevents pests from establishing by using pestfree plants quarantine and sanitizing tools for example disinfecting cuttings or sourcing certified seeds minimizes the risk of introducing pathogens or insects eradication targets existing pests by isolating and destroying infected plants removing weeds that may host pests rotating crops and applying chemical treatments called eradicants to eliminate pathogens insects and weeds protection builds barriers against pests either through environmental control such as adjusting moisture levels or by applying chemicals to repel insects and pathogens for instance maintaining optimal moisture levels and applying preemptive fungicides help protect plants resistance involves breeding plants to resist pests through physical traits like thicker leaf cuticles or genetic modifications though resistance often weakens as pests adapt pesticides include herbicides for weeds fungicides for fungi and insecticides for insects available in formulations like solutions granules powders and fumigants each formulation serves specific needs based on area size cost safety and application ease and must be carefully timed for maximum efficacy either as protectants before pests arrive or eradicants for immediate pest elimination
product packaging when homeowners go to their local garden center to purchase a pesticide they usually select from an assortment of liquid products contained in glass or plastic bottles dusts packaged in shaker top containers or bags of granules to be applied with a spreader while some of the pesticide products may require mixing with water for dispersal through the gardeners sprayer it is increasingly common that the product will be sold already mixed and dispersible directly from its own container as a spray bottle pressurized can or atomizer it is also common for the product to be multipurpose with the pesticide or herbicide incorporated at the proper dilution as part of a combination material weed and feed lawn granules and sprays that contain both insecticides and fungicides exemplify these combination products the benefits of premixed and multipurpose pesticide packaging are twofold convenience for the consumer and greater safety since there is less chance of an incorrect dosage being applied pesticides available for legal application only by professional horticulturists are packaged differently because they usually have a higher percentage of the active ingredient and they are applied in much larger quantities commercial pesticides may be packaged in bags large multigallon jugs barrels or as premeasured water soluble packets due to increased environmental concerns from the general public government officials and members of the green industry many commercial pesticides are packaged in recyclable containers that are returnable to the manufacturer that eliminates the applicators problem of safely disposing of empty toxic containers as described previously the use of watersoluble packets ensures that the pesticide will be mixed correctly figure 616 this packaging is best suited to large scale applications since homeowners seldom can use up all of the product many companies are testing industry reaction to closed system packaging of various pesticides wherein the user simply attaches a premeasured pesticide contained in a returnable refillable bulk tank to their own spray apparatus and program the proper dosage into a computer contained within the pump also enjoying increased use is the microinjection of fungicides directly into the roots and the vascular system of plants although available for a number of years microinjection is now most valued for its packaging and delivery of the pesticide within a closed system figure 617 pesticide safety the safe use of chemical pesticides requires a respect for their toxicity all manufacturers and distributors of pesticides are required by federal law to provide explicit information about their products ingredients formulations toxicity and proper rates of application and about the specific pests controlled and proper means of safe handling this information is provided on the pesticide label figure 618 the signal words that indicate the products level of toxicity should be committed to memory by everyone who must work with these important but dangerous tools of modern agriculture table 62 equally important is the material safety data sheet msds that is prepared for each chemical product and included with it at delivery figure 619 the msds provides a complete compilation of all the information a user should know about the product information includes the manufacturer the products chemical name physical properties and chemical reactivity fire and explosion data health hazard data including symptoms of exposure and carcinogenicity special protection and handling information and an emergency telephone number to call at any time for information regarding treatment for exposure or spillage msds sheets should be kept in a place where they can be easily referenced if needed copies should be posted where everyone working with the pesticides can read them to protect against pesticide misuse the following safeguards should always be observed use only products tested and recommended by the state college of agriculture follow the manufacturers directions for safe application of the product note it is a violation of federal law to use pesticides in a manner inconsistent with the label directions use the lowest recommended concentration do not arbitrarily increase dosage or frequency of application do not apply on a windy day or before a rain this precaution will prevent drifting of sprays and dusts in the wind and runoff of pesticides in rainwater mix only the amount of pesticide that can be applied at one time if excess remains try to use it up on tolerant crops rather than disposing of the chemical elsewhere avoid spraying near streams and lakes or on slopes where runoff flows directly into a body of water also do not spray near bee hives or at a time when bees are pollinating keep pesticides in a locked area that is wellventilated and is clearly marked with the statement that it contains pesticides do not stockpile pesticides because the danger of container corrosion and leakage increases with age wash all application equipment and clothing thoroughly after use soap and water on the gloves before removal three water flushings of spray tanks and hoses for equipment all contaminated clothing hosed off and hung to dry store protective clothing away from the chemicals for certain pesticides such as nonselective herbicides the sprayer should be marked and not used for any other purpose lest the residue harm an important crop careful records of pesticide use must be kept including what was applied to what in what amounts when and by whom empty pesticide containers should be disposed of carefully they should never be set out for municipal collection or just hauled off to a local dump site many states have designated chemical dump sites where materials are carefully packaged and identified before disposal with less toxic pesticides empty containers should be buried or transported to a sanitary landfill telephone numbers of nearby doctors hospitals and the closest poison control center should be posted in a conspicuous location the role of adjuvants weather the severity of host infection and the stage of development of the irritant pest are all factors in the effectiveness of a pesticide to waste time andor product on a control effort that is ineffective is both economically and environmentally unsound that is what happens when a pesticide rolls off the waxy epidermis of a plant or when it settles to the bottom of a sprayer tank rather than staying mixed in the water carrier add to that concern the dangers of a pesticide being blown as particles or vapors onto nearby plants soil or animals for which it was never intended and environmental alarms go off throughout the region adjuvants address those problems adjuvants are chemical additives that improve the performance of the pesticide with which they are combined there are an increasing number available for horticulturists to select from but not all have the same qualities and not all are used for the same purpose table 63 lists some of the types of adjuvants available and describes their modes of action when combined with pesticides because of the differences in both type and mode of action growers and others who apply pesticides must be careful in their selection of a particular adjuvant increasingly the manufacturers of pesticides are specifying the appropriate adjuvant on the pesticide label when a manufacturers recommendation is not available pesticide applicators need to work with a reputable supplier who can help them select the proper adjuvant to meet their needs certification during the last two decades of the twentieth century concern about the use of pesticides grew within all segments of the national and international populations stories and anecdotes of misusesome true some exaggerated and some totally fabricatedresulted in government regulatory reactions that ranged from wise and overdue to knee jerk and hyperpolitical the green industry while not welcoming every change particularly those perceived as restrictive and unwarranted has generally complied one of the outcomes of the concern was regulation some wellknown and widely used pesticides were either removed from manufacture or reformulated into diluted less toxic forms many pesticides are no longer available in high potency forms to nonprofessionals such as home gardeners the formulations that have their active ingredients in high percentages or require special techniques to apply are now available for purchase and use only by professionals who are certified pesticide applicators the certification is conferred by state governments after an applicant passes an examination that demonstrates knowledge of safe pesticide use renewal of the certification is mandated every few years to ensure that applicators stay current with new knowledge and regulations,pesticide packaging varies according to user needs and product type home gardeners typically buy readytouse products such as spray bottles shakertop dust containers or granular bags for easy application professional horticulturists however work with more concentrated products packaged in bulk containers like barrels or large jugs many products today come in multipurpose or premixed forms combining pesticides herbicides or fertilizers to minimize dosing errors and enhance consumer safety safe pesticide use is critical and involves strict adherence to the manufacturers instructions proper storage in locked ventilated areas and thorough cleaning of equipment labels and material safety data sheets msds provide essential safety ingredient and emergency information adjuvants which are chemical additives increase the effectiveness of pesticides by improving adherence stability and preventing drift making them both environmentally and economically advantageous certification for professional pesticide applicators is required entailing exams and periodic renewals to ensure adherence to current safety standards and regulations this system promotes responsible pesticide use protecting both public health and the environment
biological control the chemical control of plant pests became necessary as a result of human intervention and manipulation of the natural world by selectively producing masses of desired plants and reducing or eliminating the natural diversity of a regions flora horticulturists foresters and farmers destroyed the checkandbalance system that kept plant pest populations in proper proportion with their host plants when a field of natural growth is cleared and replaced with thousands of plants of the same species the pests that thrive in the new simplified environment also increase simultaneously the factors that once held those pests in check may also have been eliminated the solution for many years has been to reach for the sprayer chemical control of pests also owes its acceptance and development to the publics desire for plant products that are blemishfree and visually attractive while leaves with a few spots or shrubs with a few insects or a golf course fairway with a few weeds should be regarded as natural and expected the economic reality is that consumers have been conditioned to view such conditions as unacceptable it has followed that growers landscapers and property managers do whatever is necessary to meet the expectations of their customers including chemically controlling plant pests biological control is an attempt to return some of the natural inhibitors of insect pathogen and weed injury to the production of desired crops including the ornamentals the techniques currently being used include plant extractsnatural chemicals produced by certain plants that can repel andor impede the development of some insects these extracts include pyrethrum extracted from chrysanthemums and rotenone physical featuresstructural characteristics such as thick waxy cuticles or an especially pubescent leaf surface can protect plants from insect damage or pathogen entry plant emissionssome plants secrete chemicals from their roots that are toxic to certain pathogens such as nematodes and to certain nearby plants that might otherwise compete for available water and nutrients still other plants repel insects by exuding a strong scent that the insects cannot tolerate predators and parasitesinsects and other animal pests that feed on plants are in turn the food of choice for a variety of other insect and animal predators additionally there are bacteria and fungi that will infect and kill a number of insects and nematodes and even other bacteria and fungi alternate hostssome plant pests have a preference of one host species over another when an economically valuable species is interplanted with a species preferred by the pest the alternate host becomes a decoy permitting pestfree production of the desired species by selecting host species that possess features which discourage pests or by incorporating into production sites those plants that will discourage or repel pests or by releasing into the production area predatory or parasitic agents that will infect the undesirable pests horticulturists use the constraints of the natural world against biotic irritants of all types the major drawback to a more widespread use of biological controls is the smaller number of ornamentals that possess the physical or physiological features needed to discourage the pests that affect them genetic engineering by plant breeders may increase the number of ornamental species possessing characteristics that protect against pests that progress will be predictably slow in coming still proponents of chemical and biological control of plant pests have begun to work together for a common purpose nothing exemplifies that more clearly than the increasing acceptance of integrated pest management throughout the green industry the use of chemical pesticides is being reassessed not to eliminate them from use but to incorporate them into a more broadbased package of control measures that package returns some of the balance of the natural world to horticultural production by allowing beneficial insect and microbial predators of destructive insects and pathogens to exist within the production range by so doing the predators keep the population of harmful insects and pathogens to a level that does not necessitate excessive use of chemical pesticides when they are used chemical pesticides are applied only when and where needed rather than when their use is excessive wasteful and expensive this multifaceted approach to pest control is termed integrated pest management ipm it applies the principles of control by carefully balancing the relationship existing among the crop hosts the production environment and the plant pests to which the crops are susceptible figure 620 the techniques of ipm vary with the circumstances of production in greenhouses for example the production facility is closed and contained this structure permits the screening of vents and therefore the introduction of predatory insects into the crop with the knowledge that they will remain and justify their cost table 64 lists some of the predators currently available for insect and disease control in greenhouses due to the openness of the production site field and container nurseries are less able to use predatory insects in their ipm programs instead they rely heavily on cultural practices such as proper spacing and pruning balanced watering fertilizer monitoring elimination of weeds and other alternate hosts and the use of resistant varieties to reduce pest populations other aids to control include horticultural oils that suffocate the insects insecticidal soaps that kill insects on contact insect growth regulators biological pesticides and when necessary chemical pesticides table 65 lists some of the biological products currently used to control insects on ornamental and turf crops briefly summarizing how the various biological controls work plant extracts are chemicals found naturally in certain plants that are known to have an insecticidal or herbicidal action when extracted concentrated and applied to vulnerable pests these natural chemicals can interfere with the growth and development of certain pests microorganisms that can be used as antagonists against other organisms include various species of bacteria fungi protozoa viruses and nematodes they are applied often as sprays to host crops where they infect and destroy the target pest microbederived pesticides use the natural antibiotics and other compounds extracted from microorganisms to control plant pests products vary in their targets and in their toxicity to nontarget species pyrethroids are synthetic versions of the natural extracts pyrethrins they tend to control a wider range of pests and remain effective longer than the natural pyrethrins soaps are light oils made from plants the insecticidal soaps work against soft bodied insects by penetrating their outer layer and dehydrating their interiors the herbicidal soaps have a similar effect against the outer cuticle of the leaves of target weeds insect growth regulators disrupt the growth and development of insects the effect is usually hormonal and interferes with the metamorphosis of the insects choronicotinyls are similar to insect growth regulators that act by impeding the normal functioning of the insect nervous system they are systemic and can be applied as either granulars or as sprays pheromones are chemical cues used by insects to communicate with other insects the sex pheromones are used to attract mates when synthesized sex pheromones can be used as baits to attract and trap certain insects it is more useful as a management and monitoring tool than as a control measure bacteriophages one of the most recent and fastest growing areas of ipm control is the use of bacteriophages which are viruses that infect bacteria commonly referred to simply as phages they are natural components of the environment and are nontoxic to eukaryotes that makes them much safer than chemicals they are also specific to the particular bacterium that they target so they are harmless to other desirable microbes phages are selfreplicating and will do so only as long as the targeted host bacterium is present once the host is eliminated the phage quickly degrades phage preparations are easily and effectively combined with chemical pesticides allowing them to be applied simultaneously and with no diminution of their effectiveness compost tea another newcomer to integrated pest management programs is the use of waterbased fermented compost preparations commonly referred to as compost tea the precise formulation is still in the early stages of development with exact proportions of compost feedstocks water and added nutrients unknown even the fermentation time most desirable ph optimum temperature and the best age of the composting material are still undefined while much more information about the formulation will undoubtedly be forthcoming greenhouse growers turf specialists and golf course superintendents are exploring ways to utilize compost teas as foliage sprays and soil drenches to control plant diseases it is the microorganisms in the tea that are responsible for the control of foliar diseases and the suppression of common turf pathogens depending upon the specific composting material used the tea can be manipulated to be dominated by either bacteria or by fungi which is preferred is determined by the host crop and by the soil type implementing an ipm program the objective of an integrated pest management program is to manage pests and the environment in a manner that balances the benefits of selected control measures against their costs the public health and welfare and the impact on environmental quality three steps are involved in its implementation determining the action threshold in commercial horticulture profitable control is the goal of pest control some level of plant injury and or some presence of the pest must be accepted the point at which the injury to the host plants or the number of pests present is unacceptable is termed the action threshold the action threshold signals the need for control measures to be applied but the same signal does not apply to every situation in greenhouse or nursery production the threshold signal would sound when the economic profitability of a crop is threatened in a landscape or golf course there may be no danger of plant loss but the appearance of key plants is marred resulting in an outcry against the declining esthetics in such cases the action threshold is reached when the appearance of the landscape falls below a level acceptable to viewers obviously there is room for subjective variation when esthetics are the measure measuring for pest presence the site and host plants must be checked regularly and methodically for the presence of pests the monitor or scout must fully understand what pests are of concern their life cycles their appearance at different stages of the life cycle and their time of greatest potential threat to the host plants monitors must also be able to recognize desirable or harmless insects and other agents monitoring requires immediate recognition of when the action threshold is near selecting and initiating the proper control method for profitable control in an ipm program there are numerous options commonly used in combinations use resistant varieties of host plants eliminate infected plants andor alternate hosts cultural manipulation of the production site and environment biological controls chemical controls,biological control seeks to restore ecological balance in agriculture by utilizing natural mechanisms to manage pests contrasting sharply with the chemical control methods that arose from human disruptions to ecosystems human activities like monoculture farming have favored pest proliferation while eliminating natural pest inhibitors while chemical pesticides provide immediate results and align with consumer demands for aesthetically pleasing plants their overuse can harm beneficial organisms and the environment in biological control various strategies are employed such as using plant extracts with insectrepelling properties utilizing plants with structural defenses and introducing natural predators and parasites to suppress pest populations integrated pest management ipm integrates both biological and chemical strategies focusing on sustainable practices this multifaceted approach involves monitoring pest presence establishing action thresholds to determine when control measures are necessary and employing techniques like selecting resistant plant varieties cultural practices and biological controls emerging tools in ipm include bacteriophagesviruses that specifically target harmful bacteriaand compost teas enriched with beneficial microorganisms these innovations aim to enhance pest control while minimizing environmental impact ensuring a balanced ecosystem in agricultural production
the value of flowers the use of flowers in gardens and homes is welldocumented through most of recorded history as civilizations have evolved flourished and floundered the use of flowers has appeared to parallel peoples attitudes toward civility taste art and religion ancient romans rewarded their national heroes with wreaths and garlands of flowers and laurel leaves the victorians in england confident of their leadership in the world and buoyed by a century of british rule used flowers in complex masses in their gardens perennial borders and in their homes japan isolated for centuries from the civilizations and religions of the western world regarded flowers as materials for spiritual expression the oriental use of flowers is probably the most personal and intimate that the world has known americans began by copying the uses familiar to their emigrant ancestors today however a distinctive american style of flower arranging has evolved which if analyzed would probably represent a mixture of the styles of many nations selecting the best from an assortment of influences american floral design is now the worldwide pacesetter for stylized arrangements we use flowers to express our joys and our sympathies flowers highlight the key moments in our lives the birth of a child the holidays the first dance weddings anniversaries illnesses and deaths such uses have been traditional for many years in instances like these most people turn to a professional florist to arrange the flowers at other times we arrange our own flowers when a selection of blossoms is cut from the garden brought into the house and placed into a vase or a single bloom is selected to wear in the lapel of a suit or in the hair the use of the flowers becomes much more personal flowers today serve as gifts to friends and business associates they accompany our entertainments and reward our heroes whether stars of theater opera house battlefield or race track they permit the most inarticulate among us to convey our feelings when words may be hard to find floral designart or craft the terms art and science are widely misused tractor repair is ennobled as an industrial art and lawnmowing is glorified as turfgrass science equally tedious is the insistence by some purists that only they know the distinctions that separate true art and science from all pretenders so it is with the terms art and craft what separates the two which is floral design floral design is a craft it can be learned by nearly anyone who wishes to take the time however the level of expertise and degree of creativity expressed by flower arrangers increase as their appreciation and knowledge of fine art increase if art is the creation of new and harmonious relationships among lines and forms then floral design may qualify as an art in the hands of someone who can use living materials in the same way that others use paint or stone commercial florists seldom acquire the knowledge of fine art necessary to create truly original relationships with their materials although very often their work is beautiful imaginative and skillfully executed their work is usually a copy or modification of styles created by others sometimes centuries earlier accordingly theirs can be regarded as the craft of flower arranging being a craft floral design can be taught yet as with any skill some practitioners will develop a greater proficiency than others because of the time they spend practicing and their level of personal interest to become a superior designer florists must first learn the mechanics of their trade how to prepare flowers for use in designs how to position them in arrangements and how to package the finished work for delivery in addition superior florists will study design of all types from classical to contemporary the natural world with its endless combinations of line and form literature and social sciences to better understand the many shades of human behavior and emotions and the fine arts including painting sculpture and music all too often florists try to substitute personality and pretensions for a solid foundation of knowledge and training in floral design as elsewhere however there is no substitute for hard work and education materials needed to arrange flowers professional florists select their tools from a wide assortment of products available following are the major types of tools needed for professional floristry figures 71 to 74 cutting tools 1 select a short blade made of quality steel that will hold an knife edge the short blade will help prevent cut fingers 2 they have short blades with serrated edges and are florist shears used for cutting both herbaceous and woody plant material 3 the best ones have two cutting blades of quality pruning shears steel they are used for cutting woody materials 4 these are similar to ordinary scissors in appear ribbon shears ance 5 a widely serrated cutting edge makes it suitable styrofoam cutter for cutting and shaping blocks of styrofoam wiring materials 1 wire is used to support weak flower stems and to hold florist wire curved lines in arrangements it varies according to length and thickness gauge the heaviest gauge is number 18 and the finest number 32 as the weight of flowers or foliage increases the weight of the wire needed to support them also increases 2 chenille stems are like pipe cleaners with extra chenille stems flocking they are used for decorative purposes and to provide water to corsage flowers 2 a heavy gauge wire is needed to wire arrangements spool wire such as wreaths and door swags 4 these are short pieces of wire enclosed in paper they fill twistems a number of roles in which support or repair is needed 5 green wood picks with a length of thin wire attached wooden picks can be fastened to stems or other materials and inserted into a holding substance they are widely used with nonliving arrangements 6 these are similar in use to wooden picks and are dis metal picks pensed from a machine adhesive materials 1 this tape is similar to a waxed crepe paper it has a floral tape stretching quality and is used to wrap flower stems when wire is needed for their support it comes in assorted colors to blend unseen into the arrangement 2 its most common use is to hold stem support waterproof tape material such as floral foam in the container 3 a waterproof material it is used to hold pinpoint stem florist clay holders in place within a container 4 some glues dissolve styrofoam this material does styrofoam glue not yet it is a strong adhesive 5 the glue is inserted as a solid stick into the gun it hot glue gun is heated electrically and dispensed in a liquid state that quickly cools and hardens stem support materials 1 the most common material used by profes waterholding foams sional florists to support fresh flowers is floral foam it is a lightweight soft and porous material that holds flower stems in a fixed position while enabling them to absorb water there are several manufacturers of the foams the most wellknown of which is the smithersoasis company their foam products are termed oasis floral foams are available in dry blocks shredded foams and pellets they are also produced in varying densities to support stems of different weights and sturdiness in arrangements where the block of foam is not fully concealed by foliage sheet moss may be pinned over the foam to disguise it 2 styrofoam does not hold water it is commonly shredded styrofoam used to hold the stems of dried silk and plastic flowers and foliage especially in tall containers if fresh materials are used water must be added to fill in between the particles of styrofoam 3 an excellent base for dried and permanent block styrofoam arrangements it cannot be used with fresh flowers 4 this wire has a 1inch mesh and can be rolled loosely chicken wire into a ball and inserted into the container stems can then be inserted into the folded mesh 5 these are used more commonly by homeown pinpoint holders ers than by professional florists because of their expense they are held in the container with florist clay stems are then pressed onto the pins they are reusable 6 made of clear glass or opaque black the glass pebbles and marbles marbles are used to support long stems in tall vase arrangements the pebbles are often used in bowl containers 7 the grids snap on the top of vases and some novelty plastic grids containers and hold flower stems in position because of the variation in container sizes plastic grids are not available for all containers a handmade grid can be substituted using crisscrossed thin strips of waterproof floral tape,flowers have held symbolic and aesthetic significance across cultures reflecting values emotions and spirituality ancient romans used flowers to honor heroes while the victorians displayed them in elaborate garden borders and the japanese employed floral arrangements for spiritual expression in the united states a unique floral style has emerged blending various international influences today flowers mark significant life events like births weddings and funerals offering ways to express emotions when words fall short floral design is primarily a craft with potential to become an art when infused with creativity and knowledge of design skilled designers master various tools and materials cutting tools like florist shears shape plants precisely wiring materials provide structure supporting delicate or heavy blooms adhesive materials such as floral tape and hot glue secure flowers in place stem support materials like floral foam and styrofoam keep stems stable hydrating live flowers while supporting dried and artificial ones floral design combines skill and aesthetics allowing florists to create arrangements that resonate personally and culturally
containers for floral arrangements among the changes that have elevated public appreciation of floral arrangements has been the imaginative use of containers from antique vases to beer mugs anything that can hold stem support material is now fair game for the creative florist the container may set or at least contribute to the theme of the arrangement if it can hold water it can be used for fresh flowers if it cannot hold water it may still hold waterfilled foam wrapped in waterproof foil and fixed in place with wire tape or clay containers that do not hold water may also be used successfully with permanent materials an important quality of all containers is that they not detract from the overall arrangement and the beauty of its plant materials such is often the case when a designer selects a novelty container for the sheer cleverness of doing so a flashy container can never improve a mediocre design but it can definitely hurt a good one containers should be carefully selected as one element of the total arrangement they must first serve the functional needs of this arrangement be appropriate for the shape of arrangement desired and be able to hold the proper stem support material designers can then give their imagination full reign in selecting the appropriate container you should know the basic types first and how to arrange them then try your hand with more inventive containers figure 75 care of cut flowers cut flowers come to the florist shops of america from all over the nation and the world although some retail florists may order flowers direct from the grower most purchase from a local wholesaler who buys in large quantities from flower growers worldwide by the time cut flowers reach the local flower shop they may have traveled by airplane truck and bus all within a few days some of the transport will have been refrigerated some will not have been the flowers must be attended to immediately on arrival or the perishable product may be lost and with it the florists investment flowers arriving from a wholesaler are usually bound in bunches or clusters the blossoms may be wrapped in waxed paper sleeves to prevent damage and the clusters may be shipped in special boxes that reduce crushing and permit some air circulation if you recognize the logic behind them the steps to take when flowers arrive at the flower shop are easy to remember the cut flowers must receive 1 nutrition for continued good health 2 water to prevent wilting 3 cool temperatures to slow their metabolic activity and prolong their lives therefore cut flowers first are unpacked carefully their bases are then recut on an angle to expose fresh vascular tissue for maximum water uptake note in addition gladiolus and chrysanthemum stem ends may be crushed with a hammer to facilitate water absorption the freshly cut stems are immediately placed into disinfected containers filled approximately onethird full with fresh water containing a flower preservative the preservative contains nutritional sugar plus an antibiotic to prevent bacterial plugging of the vascular tissue flower containers should not be overfilled with water or the stems may become waterlogged or even start to rot warm water is preferable to cold because the flowers can absorb it more quickly after several hours in water at room temperature the flowers should be turgid and ready to be cooled they are then placed into the cooler usually kept between 38 and 40f forms of arrangement materials most of the materials that are visible in an arrangement are flowers and foliage as dried arrangements and novelty design increase in popularity additional material may be considered for use nevertheless all of these materials can be categorized into four basic types figure 76 some flowers and nonflower materials may play more than one role for example gladiolus blossoms are often removed from their long vertical stem and clustered at the center of an arrangement changing them from line forms to mass forms roses used while tight buds on long stems will be strong line forms when used as fully opened flowers on short stems they function as mass forms spray mums are regarded as filler flowers in a large arrangement yet in a small container they can serve as mass forms principles of floral design because floral design like all design is personal it is difficult to evaluate if a furniture designer creates a chair with one leg shorter than the other three most people will agree that the design is unsatisfactory because it overlooks one of the most obvious functions of the chair with a floral design such clearcut cases of right and wrong are usually lacking the florist who designs an arrangement can be expected to like it another florist or a customer may or may not agree they will all be confident that they are right but their judgments are usually more subjective than objective nowhere do opinions come into conflict more frequently than in a classroom if teachers and learners are to discuss design based on logic rather than personal opinion they need a common ground where both master and apprentice can tread with confidence and mutual respect that common ground is created by the principles of design that guide all creative endeavors whether sculpted in marble woven into tapestries or arranged in a vase a design can be judged on the basis of how closely it adheres to these principles simplicity even the most imaginative stylish designs are based on uncomplicated themes and draw on few elements for their composition designs should be limited to one distinctive line readily apparent to the viewers eye colors should be limited to a few that contrast or blend harmoniously the container should contribute to the total arrangement and not attract too much attention to itself the kinds of flowers and foliage used also should be limited too many shapes and textures can overcomplicate the design finally the setting and background for the arrangement need to be considered a heavily patterned wallpaper or dress can add complexity to the floral design focalization of interest each arrangement benefits by having only one center of attention for the viewers eye such a focal point becomes the visual center of the design it is usually the point where the major lines of the design coverage at the center of the container and just above its edge there are several ways to focus a design one way is to concentrate the mass form flowers at the center of the design another way is to use larger flowers at the center still another way is to use more eyeattracting colors at the focal point the placement of a figurine bow candle or other nonflower element at the designs visual center can also emphasize the focal point scale and proportion there are three size relationships to be considered in a floral arrangement 1 the relationship among flowers and other materials used as components of the arrangement to illustrate the arrangements shown throughout this chapter have the smallest flowers at the top and edge of the design intermediate sizes follow and the largest flowers are at the center or focal point such a use of flower sizes follows the sequence by which blossoms unfold in nature and is termed transition regardless of whether the flowers and foliage are of the same species throughout the arrangement the traditional sequencing of flower and leaf sizes is an important concept if scale and proportion are to be maintained 2 the relationship between flowers and their container neither should overpower or be dwarfed by the other there is one widely accepted measure of correct scale figure 77 if the container is taller than it is wide the height of the arrangement should be at least one and onehalf but no more than two and onehalf times the containers height if the container is wider than it is tall the arrangement height should be at least one and onehalf but no more than two and onehalf times its width 3 the relationship between the finished arrangement and the situation in which it will be used a dinner table arrangement should not encroach on the guests plates with its width nor be so tall that guests cannot see over it a corsage should not be so large that it pulls the fabric of a gown with its weight an arrangement of violets can appear to advantage on a bookshelf in a small room but go unnoticed in a large entrance hall conversely an arrangement designed to fill a window seat in a victorian home would nearly fill a small dining room in an apartment balance in floral design balance is more visual than actual the viewer needs to sense the same amount of importance on each side of center center may or may not be the midpoint of the container it should be regarded as the point of convergence of the designs horizontal and vertical lines when correctly balanced a design will not appear to lean forward or backward or to the left or right two types of balance are common to floral design symmetrical and asymmetrical a symmetrical arrangement if bisected by a line axis running from the vertical tip through the base of the container has flowers and foliage in almost exactly the same places on opposite sides of the line figure 78 an asymmetrical arrangement has an axis also but it may or may not bisect the container equally it also extends from the vertical tip of the design through the point where the arrangements lines converge the collective visual weight of the flowers foliage and container on one side of the axis should equal that on the opposite side yet one side is not a mirror image of the other figure 79 the majority of modern designs are asymmetrical because they permit greater creativity by the designer still symmetrically balanced arrangements are not uncommon and they are a good place for new designers to begin 4 the relationship between the finished arrangement and the situation in which it will be used a dinner table arrangement should

care for cut flowers and materials for creative arrangements containers ranging from vases to unexpected items like mugs can enhance an arrangements theme watertight containers work for fresh flowers while nonwatertight ones can hold waterfilled foam or support permanent materials proper flower care includes recutting stems at an angle for hydration using warm water with preservatives and refrigerating flowers to maintain freshness arrangements incorporate materials categorized as line flowers mass flowers and fillers to provide structure visual interest and texture key design principles enhance aesthetics and functionality simplicity encourages limited colors and elements for clarity focalization draws the viewers eye to a central interest point scale and proportion maintain balance among flowers containers and the environment balance creates stability with symmetrical or asymmetrical styles ensuring even visual weight distribution these principles allow designers to craft arrangements that resonate with viewers suit various occasions and maintain harmony between container flowers and their surroundings
patterns of arrangements three standard geometric shapes lend themselves naturally to flower arrangements the circle the triangle and the rectangle all lend themselves to the creation of symmetrical formal arrangements all are easily modified into informal arrangements as ovals and asymmetrical triangles figure 710 these six standard patterns form the foundation of american floral design the refinement of these geometric forms has been the major contribution america has made to worldwide floristry the patterns are made up of six basic lines which are universal in their origins and applications while limitless variations of these lines exist the aspiring floral designer needs to begin with a knowledge of the basics figure 711 once the basic patterns and lines are understood it is easy to analyze the composition of most floral arrangements for example the lines of a symmetrical triangle arrangement are seen to be that of a balanced inverted t an asymmetrical triangle has a right angle rectangular arrangements employ either the vertical or horizontal lines circular or oval patterns are built around the crescent or hogarth curve you should now apply this information by analyzing the arrangements pictured in figures 710 and 711 determine which basic lines are shaping the patterns note the forms of the flowers used their sizes and numbers note also their placement within each arrangement even though the photographs are black and white the principles of design should be apparent find the focal point of each design and assess its types of balance how have simplicity scale and proportion and rhythm and line been achieved using color to advantage the topic of color its many contributions and how best to take advantage of its values is integral to the study of floral design it is also a topic that can be overintellectualized thereby destroying the fun of studying it although the subject does lend itself to study and research by scientists and artists alike you may take comfort in knowing that nearly everyone possesses a natural ability to use color correctly therefore a study of color can be regarded mostly as a deciphering of why certain colors go together pleasantly or unpleasantly given a selection of painted blocks or swatches of cloth most people could select and arrange colors in combinations that they and most viewers would find attractive the precise nature of the color combinations might vary depending on the setting mood time of day season and assorted other influences in floral design the colors chosen for an arrangement may be based on the occasion that the flowers acknowledge the room where they will be placed the background against which they will be placed the light under which they will be viewed the season of the year the preferences of the person for whom the flowers are intended the preferences of the purchaser the preferences of the floral arranger color terminology to understand color you should understand the terminology used to describe its qualities and its variations are the six major groupings of colors visible when color families white light is passed through a prism or when a rainbow is seen after a shower the six color families are red orange yellow green blue and violet is the quality from which the family name is derived it is the hue color in its most brilliant and unaltered state is the hue lightened by the addition of white in flowers a tint tint appears as a pastel color is the hue darkened by the addition of black dark reds or shade bronzes are examples of shades in flower colors is the hue grayed by the addition of both white and black tone certain flowers are distinguished by their smoky tones in contrast to their more brilliant counterparts that remain closer to the original hue is the quality of visual strength or weakness that intensity characterizes a color both tints and shades may appear weak if the white or black dilutants dominate the original hue where the hue predominates the color appears stronger is also a visual quality based on the amount of white black weight or gray in the color white gives a lightness to colors whereas black creates a sense of heaviness is the quality of certain colors that allows them to be luminosity seen under dim light tints because of the white in them have a higher luminosity than tones or shades and warmth coolness we frequently associate colors with temperatures reds and oranges are considered warm colors because we associate them with fire blue and green are considered cool colors because of their association with water and shade is the ability of colors to appear closer or father away in movement general intense colors appear to advance and less intense colors appear to recede color schemes certain groupings of colors color schemes have gained sufficient understanding and acceptance to justify describing them all are based on the color wheel figure 712 a color scheme may be related or contrasting depending on the location of the colors on the wheel related color schemes may be monochromatic or adjacent contrasting color schemes may be complementary triadic or polychromatic related color schemes utilize one color in its many related monochromatic color schemes values the one color may incorporate assorted tints shades and tones in the flowers foliage and container use one of the primary colors red yellow adjacent color schemes or blue with other colors derived from that primary for example browns oranges and golds have in common the primary color of yellow and work well together in an autumn arrangement adjacent colors are so named because of their close proximity on the color wheel contrasting color schemes use colors that are opposites or near complementary color schemes opposites on the color wheel the colors do not share a common primary color relationship examples include red and green blue and orange and yellow and violet use three colors that are spaced equidistantly triadic color schemes on the color wheel it may be necessary to use some variations of tints tones or shades to find the right color combination use all of the hues together the polychromatic color schemes brilliance can often be too intense so the floral designer may prefer a modified polychromatic scheme that tones it down these are not the only possible or desirable groupings of colors as stated at the outset most people have an intuitive ability to combine colors attractively the selection of colors for a floral arrangement should be based on logic and on that natural intuition in the use of color professional florists are often restricted to the colors of the flowers currently in the cooler they are also restricted by an inability to dictate the setting or background that will display the arrangement to best advantage a polychromatic arrangement for a church may be set on a white linen communion table or against a stained glass window one setting could enhance the flowers and the other absorb them completely a white corsage worn on a white dress will not have the visual impact that it will have if worn against a darker color or pattern within any given arrangement darker shades and tones are best used in lesser quantities than lighter tones and tints the dark shades and tones are most effectively used at the focal center of the arrangement with lighter color used for line and filler flowers wiring flowers for design it is common practice among florists to wire certain flowers prior to their use in designs fresh dried and permanent artificial flowers and foliage may all be wired the wire must not show after the flowers are arranged so it is concealed with foliage and floral tape flowers are wired for several reasons to support stems weakened by age or poor production to straighten crooked stems to hold stems in an intentional curve for a design to extend stem length for large arrangements to replace a bulky stem permitting use of the flower in a corsage to combine single blossoms for a mass effect the techniques of wiring depends on the flower being wired more precisely it depends on the type of stem and flower head involved figure 713 after wiring the wires may require taping to cover them or disguise them to resemble stems to apply the tape hold the wired flower and stem in one hand while the other hand applies the floral tape from the base of the calyx downward figure 714 the tape is stretched tight as the flower is twirled,floral design relies on geometric shapescircle triangle and rectanglewhich form the basis for symmetrical and asymmetrical arrangements in american floral design understanding these basic patterns enables designers to create both formal and informal arrangements key lines such as vertical horizontal and curved help structure designs and provide balance rhythm and focus color plays an essential role in floral design designers use color schemesmonochromatic adjacent complementary triadic and polychromaticbased on the color wheel each scheme can impact the mood and appeal of arrangements with colors chosen based on occasion setting lighting or personal preferences terms like tint a hue lightened with white and shade a hue darkened with black help describe colors in detail while intensity and luminosity relate to a colors strength and brightness wiring flowers is a common practice especially for aged or delicate flowers allowing florists to support extend or alter stems this process involves concealing wire with floral tape to blend seamlessly into arrangements
making bows and puffs two of the mainstays of floral designs are bows and puffs puffs are small clusters of netted fabric sometimes called tulle that are used as background and lightweight filler for corsages and bouquets the netting is available in assorted colors and patterns bows are usually constructed from fabric ribbon although plastic ribbons are sometimes used for outdoor pieces small bows are used for corsages and other arrangements that are to be worn larger bows are used in table arrangements and on potted plants still larger bows are used on wreaths door swags and on wedding funeral and grave pieces a florist must be able to make a respectable bow and puff quickly and repeatedly many florists use slack periods to make them up in quantity note it is the handcrafted nature of floral materials such as bows puffs and wiring that distinguishes floral products and justifies their cost to the consumer the floral bow ribbon used by florists varies in both material and width every few years certain materials capture the fancy of florists and consumers burlap ribbons are a recent example of the faddish materials that enjoy popularity for a while at least velvetlike flocked ribbons remain pop lar for christmas arrangements and weddings as do satin ribbons even metallic ribbons have been tried regardless of the material the sizes manufactured are standardized the most commonly used are 412 inches wide no 120 used for funeral work arm bouquets wreaths and door swags 278 inches wide no 40 used for funeral sprays wedding work wreaths and swags 5 8 inches wide no 3 used for corsages 1 4 inches wide no 1 used for corsages as streamers for bridal bouquets and for head pieces after practicing the steps illustrated you will be able to produce a simple and attractive bow in table 71 the corsage or bouquet puff puffs fill out a corsage or bouquet without adding weight or much additional expense the netting material comes on rolls like a wide ribbon and ranges from 278 to 8 inches in width the netting is cut into squares and gathered with a wire to create the puff if gathered in the center a butterflyshaped puff results if gathered at the base a fanshaped puff is formed once completed the wires are covered with floral tape figure 715 assembling the arrangements the skill of arranging floral materials rapidly and skillfully into a corsage table arrangement wreath or larger piece requires time to develop just as knowing how to read a recipe does not guarantee a successful result neither will the first floral designs be flawless or easily accomplished however by following the assembly instructions and studying the illustrations you can begin to develop proficiency from this beginning point further practice added study and experience will refine your construction technique and your eye for style corsages corsages are most commonly pinned to clothing at the shoulder or banded to the wrist on occasion they may be pinned in the hair or carried as a nosegay teenage girls are the most frequent recipients of wrist corsages and nosegays adult women generally prefer to use corsages as accents to their personality clothing or a special occasion whenever possible the florist needs some questions answered before the corsage can be designed correctly the flowers should what color is the garment to be worn complement the outfit not compete with it it is usually impossible to match the color of the flowers to the color of the garment so contrasting colors are best used a sharply vertical neckline such what is the neckline of the garment as a vneck is best accented by a corsage that is also strongly vertical a scooped neckline looks best with a corsage whose line is gently curved since corsages can be either formal or informal what is the occasion in style it is helpful to know small women look best wearing a what is the size of the wearer small corsage larger women need a larger corsage to retain the proper proportionate relationship between flowers and wearer dark skinned women look better what is the skin tone of the wearer with pastel toned corsages fair skinned women often need more vivid colors to brighten their appearance does the wearer have a preference for or an allergy to certain flowers obviously the professional florist may not have all the information needed to create a totally customized corsage however too many florists ask only what color and overlook other equally vital information to prepare flowers for assembly into a corsage all or most of the stems are removed and replaced with wired and taped stems a moistened wad of cotton or chenille stem may be used to prolong the life of blossoms that wilt easily the reason for removing the stems is to lighten the weight of the corsage and decrease the mass modern corsages must be lightweight so as not to pull and tear synthetic fabrics but solidly constructed to stand up to todays active lifestyle although corsages can be made from one or two flowers corsages made with an odd number of blossoms are most common and most interesting accordingly that is the type to be described here figure 716 to construct a corsage of three five or seven blossoms step 1 select flowers that have small blossom heads and are in varying stages of maturity wire and tape flowers step 2 in one hand place the smallest most tightly closed blossom this will be the uppermost flower of the corsage and determine the direction of wearing since it always points upward step 3 behind the blossom place an artificial or fresh leaf allowing it to extend about an inch above the first flower step 4 if net puffs are being used one may be added at this point behind the flower and leaf step 5 tape the stems together tightly step 6 add a second and slightly larger flower below the first and to the right positioning is accomplished by bending the wired stem as each flower leaf or puff is added step 7 add a third flower slightly lower and to the left of the second continue in this manner until the desired number of flowers have been added reserve the most widely opened flowers for the base of the corsage leaves and puffs should also be added where needed to provide shape and background do not twist the wired stems around each other instead bind them with tape after every third stem is added to the corsage each flower leaf or puff counts as a stem step 8 add the bow to complete the corsage depending on the style of the corsage the bow may be at the base mixed with the base flowers or at the side of the arrangement step 9 tape all wires and exposed ends add a corsage pin and place in a corsage bag or box store in a cooler table arrangements table arrangements can range from a simple bud vase on a bedroom nightstand to large buffet designs as discussed here they will be regarded as the moderately sized and moderately priced arrangements commonly used on dinner tables coffee tables or end tables as with corsages the florist needs to get answers to some questions before designing a table arrangement a dinner table centerpiece what is the purpose of the arrangement must be kept low to permit guests to see over it other functions may permit a stronger vertical line to the design onesided arrangements require will it be visible from all sides fewer flowers and are suitable if the arrangement is to be placed against a wall however dinner and coffee table arrangements must be designed for viewing from all sides the colors of what colors predominate on the table or in the room the arrangement should complement the dcor not compete or clash with it this is especially important if the is there a theme to the occasion arrangement is for a party or holiday event while reputable florists always how long is the arrangement to last use fresh flowers certain species have a longer lifespan than others weekend house guests need to be celebrated with a more durable arrangement than would a fivehour dinner party does the client have a preference for colors flowers or styles before beginning the assembly of table arrangements you should refresh your memory about the container types forms of arrangement materials patterns and basic lines of floral arrangements then assembly can begin symmetrical triangle arrangement onesided triangular pattern inverted t line pedestal container waterholding foam block for fresh flowers or block stem support styrofoam for permanent flowers all one type flower with some having long stems or a flowershapes combination of line mass and filler flowers step 1 begin by securing the stem support material in the container figure 717 the waterholding foam or styrofoam should be cut to fill the container completely and extend above the rim if waterholding foam is used it should be presoaked to ensure that it contains adequate water the block of material is secured with waterproof tape applied as two crossstrips from side to side of the container and over the block of foam step 2 measure cut and wire the tallest vertical flower its length should be at least 112 times the height of the container step 3 measure cut and wire the two major horizontal flowers they should be 12 the length of the vertical flower step 4 place the three flowers into the container pressing them far enough into the foam to secure them the vertical line flower should be in the center of the container and angled back just slightly the two horizontal line flowers should be in the center of the container and angled slightly downward these three flowers establish the size and shape of the designan equilateral triangle step 5 add additional flowers staying within the triangular line each pair of flowers should be positioned at equal points right and left of center to retain the symmetrical balance of the design step 6 flowers should be small at the edges of the arrangement and increase in size and mass as they approach the focal point step 7 place the flowers so that the arrangement has a slightly convex appearance when viewed from the side step 8 foliage and filler flowers can be added to complete the arrangement they too should respect the symmetry and shape of the design this arrangement can be varied by keeping the triangle symmetrical but not equilateral a candle or figurine can be used as the focal point instead of massing flowers also the container can be changed,bows and puffs are essential in floral design enhancing arrangements with texture and color bows made from materials like satin burlap or plastic ribbon range from small corsage accents to large wreath decorations tailored for various occasions puffs clusters of netting provide lightweight volume to corsages and bouquets without overwhelming other elements creating corsages involves detailed customization based on garment color wearers size and skin tone and occasion flowers are carefully selected wired and taped to reduce weight and create a structured design that wont damage delicate fabrics odd numbers of flowers are typically used for visual interest and additional elements like bows or puffs can complement the floral composition table arrangements use containers filled with floral foam or styrofoam to secure stems one popular form the symmetrical triangle relies on balancing line mass and filler flowers for a polished look often suited for dinner tables and visible from all angles floral arrangements consider color harmony occasion durability and the rooms decor together these techniques in floral design combine artistry and practicality crafting arrangements that are both visually appealing and appropriate for the setting

indoorsemerges from longstanding traditions of using containerized plants but it requires specific care methods to meet modern challenges plants indoors face environmental stresses due to shifts in light quality water supply and air movement compared to their natural habitats acclimatization is a critical process to help tropical plants adapt to indoor conditions it involves gradually reducing light intensity and adjusting nutrients water and temperature to levels suitable for indoor survival tropical plants are favored as they lack a dormancy requirement unlike many temperate species the indoor environment limits light intensitya crucial factor for photosynthesismaking it vital to provide sufficient artificial light to sustain the plants health moisture and nutrient acclimatization also prevent oversaturation and salt buildup which can harm plants despite increasing knowledge the profession remains young and research led by organizations like the professional landscape network planet and florida foliage association ffa continues to enhance best practices interior plants are treated as perishable furnishings with a limited lifespan requiring ongoing maintenance and periodic replacement to maintain their decorative and environmental contributions
light quality once acclimatized to the reduced light intensity of the interior the plantscape may still prove unsatisfactory if the light quality is incorrect light quality is the color of light emitted by a particular source the sun emits all colors of light some of which the human eye can perceive and others that are imperceptible to humans but beneficial to plants the greenyellow light most comfortable for humans is of little use in photosynthesis by plants they depend on light from the blue and red bands of the visible light spectrum visible light is only a narrow region of the radiant light spectrum figure 81 the unit of measurement for light wavelengths is the nanometer as long as both humans and plants can derive their light energy from the sun the needs of each are satisfied indoors however where light energy is usually created by artificial means the quality of the light can vary considerably light preferred by an interior plant specialist concerned with the health of plantings may cause the skin tones of human beings to appear ashen and deathly in similar fashion an interior decorator may specify a quality of lighting that gives the human complexion a healthy glow while making nearby plantings appear brown and dead clearly someone seeking a career in interior plantscaping needs to know the types of lamps currently available and the quality of light they provide categories and examples of lamps that have some use in interior plant illumination are shown in table 81 table 82 compares the lamps in all areas important to interior plant survival you should study these tables thoroughly before proceeding further selection of the proper lamp for the illumination of an interior planting will depend on the answers to several questions how extensive is the planting are the plants to be encouraged to grow or merely to be maintained at their current size will the plants receive any sunlight if so how much and for how long how far will the artificial light source be from the plants what types of lamps are being used for general lighting of the area and what is the intensity of surface illumination provided for example consider the plantscape of a typical office the plants may be permanently located or in movable planters their functions may be to serve as room dividers establish a mood or relieve a cluttered desk top the ceiling may be 8 or 10 feet high side windows or a skylight may admit some natural light in such a setting cool white fluorescent lighting would be ideal for both general lighting and the growth of the plants people plants and furnishings look natural beneath cool white light due to its excellent color rendition and the plants receive the right quality of light for photosynthesis if additional task lighting is needed small desk lights should be used special effects such as shadows or textural highlights can be created with incandescent lights installed beneath the plants and directed upward these are called uplights some benefit will accrue to the plants from the addition of lighting at the base however if supplemental lighting is needed for photosynthesis it is most efficient when applied from overhead because chloroplasts are concentrated in the upper leaf surface a shopping mall presents different problems the corridors may have ceilings too high to permit the use of fluorescent lamps which are not good for illumination when the ceiling is much beyond 10 feet there may be skylights as well as decorative architectural lighting overall illumination by mercury or metal halide lamps would be best as in an office supplemental or decorative lighting might also be desirable for special effects or the health of the plants when uplights are used they should be installed directly into the planters and waterproofed when supplemental lights are added for overhead illumination they should be positioned to light the plants fully without shining in the eyes of viewers natural light most important of all light sources for interior plantscapes is natural sunlight when it can be planned for and depended on each footcandle of illumination that nature provides is one less that has to be provided and paid for with artificial lighting in our energyconscious society such savings are worth planning for however knowledge of how to maximize the benefits of natural light is vital otherwise more heat energy is lost through inefficient windows than is gained in light energy natural light is most helpful when it offers high levels of illumination throughout most of the year traditionally sunny areas like the southwest can make better use of natural light than areas like the northeast where clouds block the sun and snow blankets the skylights through much of the winter season sunlight entering from overhead is of greater use in the illumination of interior plantings than light entering from the side although both are helpful in neither situation will the natural light be as intense as outside light it will be significantly reduced by the glass glazing through which it passes and the distance it travels between the point of entry and the leaf surface little usable light passes more than 15 feet beyond glass so skylights in high lobby areas or shopping malls are of no benefit to plantings beneath them nevertheless they can be of great benefit in singlestory buildings with lower ceilings in a similar fashion a large interior plantscape may derive little benefit from side lighting since usable light enters at a 45 angle and plants must be placed within the narrow beam if they are to benefit figure 82 they cannot be too close to the glass or the foliage may burn however in a smaller room as in a residence natural side light can be of great value when skylights are used they must be designed to permit the most light to enter while insulating against as much winter heat loss as possible within the limits allowed by heating and structural engineering the ceiling well through which the light passes should be as wide and shallow as possible with the sides painted a reflective white and beveled outward at 45 angles figure 83 as skylights become narrower and the ceiling well deeper there is less area through which the sunlight can enter and a narrower focus of illumination on the surfaces below the difference between wide shallow skylights and narrow deep ones is similar to the difference in illumination between a floodlight and a spotlight with natural light and interior plantings the wide floodlight effect is most desirable selecting the correct lighting in summary no single recipe for correct lighting can be given there will be varied settings needs and objectives to accommodate plants will seldom be the only consideration in the selection of lamps and the quality of illumination when both plants and people are to be considered a lamp should be selected that provides the yellowgreen visible light needed to render human complexion clothing and furnishings attractive while still providing sufficient blue and red light to allow photosynthesis to exceed respiration in the plants the cool white fluorescent lamp is ideal for such a situation provided that the ceiling is not too high and that growth of the plants is not an objective if growth is desired additional incandescent lighting can be focused directly on the plants the use of more expensive growth lamps is unnecessary since they have not been proven superior to the ordinary cool white fluorescent in maintaining plant health and they do not render color well any natural light that can be used advantageously will reduce the cost of lighting the interior planting as for light intensity not all plants available from growers have been carefully studied to determine the minimum at which they will survive attractively the planet the ffa and the colleges of agriculture in the major foliage production states should be queried by anyone responsible for creating an interior plantscape the many books that purport to give lighting specifications and that stock the shelves of libraries nationwide are satisfactory for homeowners but not for professional use their information is often dated usually based on greenhouse lighting and may be questionable in accuracy recommendations should be sought that give lighting minimums in footcandles not in general terms such as high medium and low when plants are installed without documented knowledge of their lighting requirements the situation is risky at best and the plants must be watched carefully to determine if additional lighting is needed to ensure that lighting is of the right intensity and duration a simple timing device may be necessary the lights must shine on the leaves for enough time each day twelve hours minimum to allow adequate photosynthesis to occur should the hours of lighting have to be reduced for some reason the intensity of the lighting must be increased to compensate figure 84 it does not seem to matter whether foliage plants receive their needed lighting over a short or long period as long as the cumulative photosynthetic activity balances and slightly exceeds respiration with flowering plants day length often plays a critical role in determining if and when the blossoms will appear since interior plantings are currently valued most for their foliage day length is of limited importance,effective interior plant lighting relies on light quality natural sunlight and artificial lighting to ensure plants can photosynthesize and remain healthy light quality is essential as plants primarily use red and blue wavelengths for photosynthesis different types of artificial lamps such as cool white fluorescent lights offer both the necessary light spectrum for plant health and a natural appearance for humans in commercial settings highceiling areas benefit more from mercury or metal halide lamps for uniform illumination natural light is also beneficial reducing the need for artificial light and energy costs though light intensity indoors is generally lower than outdoors due to factors like window placement and distance from the light source proper skylight design can optimize natural light especially when using wide shallow wells to increase light distribution selecting the correct lighting involves understanding plant needs and ensuring consistent adequate light exposure for optimal plant health artificial lights should run for at least twelve hours daily though light intensity requirements vary by species basic guidelines are often lacking so professional input is recommended interior plants valued mostly for foliage may require different lighting than flowering plants which depend on specific day lengths to bloom
the growing medium no less important than light to the successful acclimatization of interior plants is the provision of a proper growing medium the roots must be placed in an environment that provides structural support allows the roots to absorb water and provides essential minerals further the growing medium must allow rapid drainage of water past the root zone and provide the correct ph for growth the medium that serves when plants are growing in a nursery field or production container is likely to be inappropriate for an interior installation natural field soil may be too heavy to permit rapid drainage too heavy for the floor to support if the container is large inconsistent in composition making standardized maintenance of separate planters difficult infested with insects pathogens or weeds although pasteurized natural soil may be a component of the growing medium for interior plantings additives will probably be needed it is even possible that the growing medium selected for the interior plantscape will have no natural soil in it for reasons of improved drainage hygiene ph balance or nutritional consistency the use of synthetic soils whose composition is as controlled as a cake recipe is becoming the rule rather than the exception cornell university and the university of california have been leaders in the formulation of synthetic soils for interior plant production the cornell mixes are made from vermiculite or perlite and sphagnum moss the university of california uc mixes are made from fine dune sand and sphagnum moss the ratio of components varies with the species of plants and the maintenance program to be followed in addition to the uc and cornell mixes termed the peatlite mixes there are bark mixes composed of pine bark sand and sphagnum moss these are especially acidic growing media and may require buffering with dolomitic and hydrated lime to sustain healthy plants all of the synthetic soils are mixed and sold commercially in large interior installations it may be more economical to mix the medium at the site rather than purchase the premixed commercial products all decisions about the growing medium should be made before the planters are filled and the plants installed once planted errors in the mediums composition are difficult to correct without removing the plant because the artificial media have low nutritional value for the plant complete fertilizers are required as well as periodic application of the minor elements regular soil testing is necessary to ensure that the fertilization program is correct installing the plants the acclimatization of a plants root system involves establishment of the correct relationship between roots and foliage outdoors a sizeable root system is needed to supply adequate amounts of water and minerals to the leaves for nearmaximal photosynthesis indoors photosynthesis is reduced to survivalmaintenance levels so the root system need not be as large therefore one of the first steps at the time of installation is to remove the production medium from around the roots and prune away excess roots figure 85 several methods can be used for setting plants into an interior plantscape depending on whether the plants are to be placed in ground beds or raised planters the anticipated frequency of plant replacement will partially determine the method of installation for example large trees are often permanently planted in the floor of an enclosed shopping mall because they are too large and expensive to replace figure 86 the growing medium around them must permit good drainage and retain nutrients while drainage tiles beneath the plant carry away excess water plants in such a setting must not be subjected to detergents and waxes used for floor maintenance so special design provisions such as raised edging may be necessary plants that are in raised planters or that require frequent replacement are usually not installed permanently instead they are often planted in a growing medium within a nursery container having good drainage figure 87 the containerized plant is then placed into a support medium of peat perlite sand or similar welldrained material the support medium serves to retain the plants as well as permitting excess water to drain away from the root zone and insulating the root system against abrupt temperature or moisture changes a separating sheet usually of fiberglass or a rotresistant fine mesh material is placed between the support medium and the coarse gravel lining the bottom of the planter the gravel is needed to facilitate drainage and without the separator the growing medium and support medium would gradually wash into the gravel and plug it a plastic tube inserted into the planter permits dipstick testing to determine if the planter is being overwatered it also provides a means of pumping out excess water if the planting is endangered by overwatering mulch on the surface of the planter serves to discourage moisture loss provides a decorative appearance and conceals the rims of the plant containers the same techniques used for the planting of containerized plants can be applied to inground plantings if the planter drains directly into the buildings drainage system then the vertical plastic tube is unnecessary all else remains the same except that there is no outer container watering and drainage as noted above the ability of the growing medium to drain off excess water is critical more interior plant deaths result from overwatering than from any other reason all planters must permit the removal of standing water the layer of coarse gravel already referred to is one method other methods include setting containerized plants on top of inverted pots within the larger planter and incorporating drains and spigots into planter bottoms where drainage from the planter base is planned additional planning must ensure that carpets tiles and other floor surfacings are not damaged by the runoff water sitting the plants on gravel beds into which the water can drain and then evaporate is one method handinhand with planning for drainage goes provision for proper watering some interior plantings require continuous moisture others do better if permitted to dry out between regular waterings obviously the two types of plants would not coexist compatibly in the same planter an interior plantscape must be watered according to schedule not according to the judgement of a custodian or other unqualified individual the right watering frequency is most easily determined in controlled environments such as enclosed shopping centers it is most difficult in locations where environmental variables are not stable such as by open windows or in drafts near doors the need to water a planting can be determined by feeling the soil and observing its color a gray surface color and failure of soil particles to adhere to the fingers indicate dryness moisture meters are also available for a more carefully controlled reading of the growing mediums water content although some automated watering systems exist there is a surprisingly limited use of them in large installations nationwide there are interior plantscapes utilizing hundreds of plants that are all watered by hand most definitely the technology of watering is still in the developmental stages when water is applied it must be in a quantity adequate to wet the soil deeply not shallowly shallow watering encourages shallow rooting and increases the vulnerability of the plants to damage from drying deep watering promotes deep and healthy rooting while providing the soil leaching necessary to prevent soluble salt buildup the quality of water used on the interior planting may vary with the location the most likely source will be municipal water lines most public drinking water contains chlorine and often fluoride as germicides and toothdecay deterrents respectively neither additive will harm plants under normal conditions although chlorine is potentially harmful the amounts used in drinking water are dissipated by aeration as the water bubbles from the faucet or hose nozzle more heavily chlorinated swimming pool or fountain water can damage plants and should never be used as a watering source note plants grown around enclosed pools require good air exchange in the room or the chlorine gas from the pool may damage them water is a source of soluble salts water that has been softened by means of cationexchange softeners may be dangerously high in sodium that can be toxic to plants in buildings with such water softeners alternate sources of water should be sought for the plantings in regions of the country where the need for water conservation causes recycled water to be used on interior plantings a chemical analysis of the water should be made to determine if any toxic chemicals are present that could damage the planting,an indoor plants growing medium must provide structural support water retention nutrients and allow for rapid drainage with an optimal ph traditional field soil often fails in interior settings due to excessive weight poor drainage and pest risks instead synthetic soils such as the cornell and uc mixes composed of sphagnum moss with vermiculite perlite or sand are widely used these controlled mixes support consistent plant health and sanitation for large installations it can be costeffective to mix soil onsite installation methods vary by plant size and location plants in raised planters or large beds need drainage systems like coarse gravel and separating sheets to prevent water retention that leads to root rot proper watering and drainage are essential since overwatering is a common cause of indoor plant mortality plants with different moisture needs should be watered according to a set schedule ideally determined by controlled testing to maintain the right balance water quality is also critical excessive chlorine or sodium as in softened water can harm plants
other concerns as with any planting certain routine procedures are needed to keep the plants healthy and attractive the problems that are common to plants grown outdoors are similar to those that trouble plants grown indoors in addition indoor plantings often encounter stresses not common in outdoor landscapes fertilization fertilization is needed to provide the mineral elements required for photosynthesis interior plantings need a complete fertilizer but not as often as outdoor plantings because the rate of plant growth is greatly reduced indoors the ratio of the complete fertilizer should be fairly uniform for example 111 or 212 too much nitrogen may lead to spindly succulent and unattractive vegetative growth trace elements will also need to be applied especially if the growing medium contains no real soil frequent soil testing is necessary regardless of whether the growing medium is true soil or synthetic excessive fertilizing follows only slightly behind overwatering as a major reason why interior plants fail to survive satisfactorily either organic or inorganic fertilizers will work well but the organics are generally slower in releasing their minerals for use by the plants this means that soluble salt buildup is less frequently a problem however the odor of decomposing organic fertilizers may not be welcomed in such settings as shopping malls or library lobbies therefore the use of organic fertilizers may not be practical in all situations inorganic fertilizers are applied to large interior plantscapes in liquid form this is faster and easier than applying dry granulars to each pot when there are hundreds of pots and planters to maintain speed is vital humidity humidity is seldom a problem for plants growing outdoors but it can cause problems for interior plantscapes because of the drying effects of central heating and air conditioning interior plantings must adapt to an air environment that may contain half or less of the relative humidity outside interior humidities of 40 percent or less are common preparation for the dry air must begin during the acclimatization process gradual drying of the plants atmosphere will usually allow the plant to survive after transplanting indoors in some cases attempts to increase the humidity around plantings by misting the foliage during the day have proved to be of little or no value misting may also cause damage to carpeting or furnishings proper acclimatization is the best solution at present air pollution air pollution cannot be escaped by bringing the landscape indoors pollutants in the exhaust of cars and trucks the smoke from cigarettes the chlorine gas escaping from swimming pools and the chemical soup that passes for air in our major metropolitan areas are all harmful to plants when sufficiently concentrated some plant species are more susceptible than others good ventilation is an important element in the health of interior plantings proper ventilation will carry away chlorine vapors fumes from smokers and chemical cleaning agents or the ethylene which may be present if a building is heated by some form of hydrocarbon combustion fossil fuel ethylene can also damage plants as they are shipped to the site this toxin is present in vehicle exhaust and if permitted to seep into the cabin where plants are stored may result in injury if packed tightly or in restrictive packaging the plants also may injure themselves since their own tissue produces ethylene because of the potential harm from ethylene plants should be unpacked and ventilated immediately on arrival at the time the plants are purchased the grower or shipper should guarantee that the transport vehicles will be ventilated and sealed against exhaust fumes dust dust is an air pollutant different from the others in that it is a particulate not a vapor when the leaves of a plant are coated with dust they are not only unattractive but gas exchange may be reduced due to plugged stomata air filtration reduces the amount of dust regular cleaning of the plants can also prevent dust buildup most plants in a residential interior can be rinsed off under the shower or set outside during a rainfall to wash away the dust commercial plantings can be kept clean with regular feather dusting and periodic washing cleaning should be a regular task within a total maintenance program for the interior plantscape pruning pruning will not be extensive in an interior planting because of the plants reduced rate of growth most pruning will be done to keep the plants shaped for an attractive appearance broken or damaged branches will also require removal if the plants are not intended to grow in order to avoid crowding the roots as well as the foliage must be pruned back excessive root growth in containers can result in strangulation of the root system for pruning the plantings hand pruners will be suitable for most of the herbaceous material and much of the woody material lopping shears will be helpful with larger materials and pruning saws may be needed for indoor trees methods of pruning are described later in the text interior plants should be pruned to a shape that suggests the appearance of a full canopy due to the restricted lighting in an interior planting a full canopy seldom forms however and the plants full branching structure may be visible the pruning must enhance and take advantage of this sparse foliage covering repotting repotting of plants is necessary in plantings where growth is allowed containers need to be removed from the planter and from the plant the next larger size selected and the excess space filled with growing medium if roots are matted they should be loosened before repotting if they have started to grow around themselves the large and excess roots should be pruned away the pot should not be filled to the rim with the growing medium an inch of unfilled space below the pot rim will give water room to flow into the container insects and diseases insects and diseases are not as common to interior plantings as to exterior ones but they do occur insect problems are more common than diseases the initial pest presence may be introduced by the plants themselves as they arrive from the grower insects or pathogenic inoculum may be present in the foliage roots soil or containers all should be checked carefully on arrival at an area away from the installation site the same careful check should be made each time replacement plants arrive obviously a reputable grower is the first defense against pests the most common pest problems of interior foliage plants are aphids mealybugs spider mites white flies scale thrips nematodes root mealybugs root rots leaf spots anthracnose mildews blights these pests and others are not uncontrollable when modern pesticides and methods of application can be used against them however the interior location and the presence of people make the use of sprays dusts and fumigants difficult whenever there is the possibility of people making contact with the pesticide it is dangerous to use even furnishings and carpeting can be damaged by many of the corrosive or oilbased chemicals where practical plants can be wrapped in loose plastic bags and sprayed within the bag this helps reduce the drift and the danger to people and furnishings control measures are restricted to chemical pesticides approved for application indoors removal of infected or infested plant parts washing away of insects and inoculum from plant foliage replacement of plants with healthy new ones vandalism and abuse vandalism and abuse to interior plantings may necessitate replacement earlier than expected certain locations will bring certain predictable types of abuse plantings in cocktail lounges or nightclubs may have alcoholic drinks poured into their soil those in college snack bars and dorms may have cigarette holes burned through their leaves plantings in shopping malls may be mutilated by home propagators who take cuttings faster than the plants can replace them sometimes entire plants are stolen from the planters the planters themselves are used as litter bins for paper cups cigarettes chewing gum and assorted other debris the only real defense against such damage and abuse is public education and cooperation by keeping the plantings attractive and well maintained they are less likely to be deliberately damaged replacing or repairing damaged plants as soon as they are noticed displays the concern of the owners for an attractive planting that all can enjoy grouping compatible species grouping compatible species simplifies the maintenance of the interior plantscape within any one planter the species selected should have the same requirements for light moisture fertilization and soil mix although a large plantscape may effectively combine tropical species desert species and sometimes even temperate species they should be in separate planters when plant replacement is necessary the new plants should be compatible with the existing ones the interdisciplinary team the popularity of interior plantings has grown faster than the ability of any one profession to stay abreast of it all a successful interior planting in a commercial building requires the expertise of interior plantscapers plant growers interior decorators landscape architects architects maintenance professionals and building management each professional brings his or her point of view to the project the architect sees the plants as architectural features not as living organisms building management personnel want the plants to attract customers and please employees but they too do not have a horticultural sense of plant needs maintenance professionals regard the plants as something to be dusted watered and fertilized they are concerned about the proximity of water the difficulty of changing lamps and the ease of reaching the plants each has concerns and contributions to the planning process that the others need to know the success of the plantscape is measured by its appearance and health the interior plantscaper should be consulted while the building is still in the planning stage because errors in lighting quality and intensity can be difficult to correct later drainage of planters directly into the buildings drainage pipes requires that plantings be sited permanently and near the pipes watering of the plantings necessitates a nearby supply of water to which a hose can be attached a shopping mall or office lobby should have appropriate water outlets every 50 feet along the wall and preferably within each planter otherwise hoses will be stretched across walkways endangering pedestrians and creating puddles maintenance of the plantings should be the responsibility of a contracted professional plant maintenance firm that should work closely with the architect to ensure sufficient water outlets storage space accessibility for equipment and so on failure to involve the maintenance firm in the early stages of planning can result in an unattractive plantscape shortly after installation the managers of the building must be made to understand why specific lamps are needed for plant survival even if less expensive ones are available in short fewer problems will develop for the interior planting if all professionals whose work impacts on it work together from the beginning at present such interdisciplinary cooperation is the exception rather than the rule the failure to use the team approach is often a case of architects not realizing their own limitations with horticultural materials,indoor plant care involves several essential routines and considerations fertilization is necessary though less frequent than for outdoor plants to support photosynthesis complete balanced fertilizers are recommended with caution against excessive nitrogen which causes weak growth humidity control is crucial due to indoor dryness especially in centrally heated spaces gradual acclimatization is key as misting can be impractical indoor plants also face pollution hazards including vehicle exhaust and chlorinated air which proper ventilation helps mitigate dust buildup obstructs gas exchange requiring regular plant cleaning pruning for shape and growth control is limited indoors but careful root and branch pruning may be needed repotting should address rootbound conditions while pests like aphids mealybugs and fungal infections are controlled using safe pesticides and plant inspection vandalism and grouping compatible species are additional concerns in public settings where educational efforts can reduce plant damage effective interior plant management requires interdisciplinary coordination architects landscapers and maintenance staff must collaborate to address lighting drainage and water access early in the planning process ensuring sustainable and visually appealing plant installations
maintaining landscape plants sustained care of plantings as important as the design and proper installation of landscape plantings is their ongoing maintenance many gardens do not attain the appearance envisioned by the landscape designer until the plants have time to mature aiding those plants in their healthy maturation requires attentive and knowledgeable maintenance also some designs require specific plant effects such as clipped formal hedges or espalier training to create the garden as envisioned in both instances the value of skillful landscape maintenance is apparent a maintenance program generally will include the following tasks watering fertilizing mulching edging pruning pest control and winterization watering depending on the region of the country supplemental watering may be an infrequent task or so regular that it requires an automatic irrigation system the need for a good water supply to the plantings has been discussed in earlier chapters here the subject is the objectives of proper watering its frequency and its quantity initially watering must promote deep root development by the plant to establish it securely in its location later watering must keep the plant healthy and growing actively even during dry summer weather much winter damage to evergreens can be avoided if the plants are kept well watered throughout the summer and autumn not all plants require the same amounts of water neither will all plant root systems grow to the same depth in the soil while nearly all landscape trees and shrubs will die if kept in either arid or waterlogged soil for long certain species are especially sensitive to sites that are too dry or too wet infrequent and deep watering is preferable to frequent shallow watering enough water should be applied to wet the soil to a depth of 12 to 16 inches in the southeast and southwest supplemental water may be required nearly every day in other regions supplemental watering may be weekly or even less frequent fertilization trees will grow without fertilization in most soils once they are established however they will grow with greater health and vigor if they are fertilized annually shrubs will respond to proper fertilization with lush growth greater resistance to pests and less winter damage for shrubs growing in cultivated beds fertilizer may be applied in late march or early april depending on the plants involved each 100 square feet of bed area should receive between one and three pounds of a lowanalysis complete fertilizer the fertilizer should be distributed uniformly over the soil beneath the shrubs with most of the fertilizer under the outer edge of the shrub where the fibrous roots that absorb the nutrients are located the fertilizer should not be allowed to touch the foliage or foliar burn a reaction to the chemicals may result if the soil is dry the fertilizer should be worked into the soil with a hoe if the weather has not been abnormally dry the fertilizer can be left untilled and the next rainfall or irrigation will wash it into the soil trees are fertilized in different ways depending on the species the age of the plant the adjacent plants and terrain and the equipment available to do the job small trees may be fertilized to promote their growth and ensure their health mature trees may be fertilized to sustain their health but with no concern for size expansion where trees stand in open lawn areas fertilizer can be applied to the surface using the same spreader that would be used for lawn fertilization in settings where trees are crowded by structures or other plants or are on sloped terrain where runoff would prevent movement into the soil fertilization may be by direct incorporation into the soil or directly into the tree with only a few exceptions the method used makes no difference in the trees reaction as long as the fertilization provides a correctly balanced nutritional supplement the delivery system is not significant most important is delivering the fertilizer where it can be taken up by the tree the takeup of nutrients by trees occurs at the outer extremes of the root zone and within the top six to eight inches of the soil the outer edge of the root zone in established trees was long believed to correspond to the edge of the foliage canopy termed the drip line recent knowledge indicates that tree root systems commonly extend far beyond the drip line therefore placing fertilizer close to the trunk or limiting its application just to the drip line may miss the most absorbent roots entirely if fertilizer is being applied to the soil in holes drilled with augers or by injections made with high pressure hydraulic sprayers figure 111 the holes or injections should extend from halfway between the trunk and drip line to a point approximately a quarter of the radius outside the drip line drilled holes are best for dry fertilizer application they should be six to eight inches deep and spaced 18 to 24 inches apart throughout the zone of application a dry mixture of 50 percent high analysis complete fertilizer and 50 percent sand as a carrier is poured into the holes highpressure injection uses concentrated liquid fertilizers the spacing is greater than for dry applications with the objective being to apply about a gallon of fertilizer with each injection and enough injections to deliver approximately 200 gallons of fertilizer within each 1000 square feet of the zone of application direct application of nutrients into a trees vascular system is possible using the same technology as that used to apply systemic pesticides see chapter 6 however from a purely practical standpoint it is only of relevance when a tree is in need of micronutrients that are unavailable to the tree for specific reasons such as local soil conditions the one most common mistake in the fertilization of landscape plants is the application of fertilizer too late in the growing season the result is often a flush of vegetative growth in response to the nitrogen that leaves the plant illprepared for winter great damage can result to plants from wellmeaning but illtimed fertilization mulching the objectives advantages and disadvantages of mulching and examples of commonly available products were outlined in the preceding chapter for extended maintenance of landscape plantings mulches require replacement organic mulches decompose forming humus and an ideal medium for the germination of newly deposited weed seeds unless mulch is replaced annually inorganic mulches do not decompose but decline in appearance if not freshened periodically caution old mulch should be removed before new is added otherwise the soil level over the roots is gradually deepened and the plants may die also to reduce the possibility of stem and trunk tissue being killed by the heat of decomposing mulch or by bacterial and fungal infection promoted by the moist mulch the mulch should not be piled against the trunk or crown it should be kept three to five inches back from shrub crowns and the trunks of young trees older trees need at least 8 to 12 inches of mulchfree area one important use of mulch is as a protective divider to prevent lawnmower damage to the base of plants figure 112 a gouge from a mower creates a site for pathogen or insect invasion of the plant if hit repeatedly a tree may become partially or completely girdled in large landscapes with numerous trees and an understaffed maintenance crew who rely on riding mowers for grass cutting frequent injury to trees results from attempts to mow as close as possible thereby eliminating hand trimming a ring of mulch around the base of each tree can protect the tree speed the overall mowing time and create a neat appearance figure 113 edging the term edging has a double use as a verb edging refers to cutting a sharp line of separation usually between a planting and the adjacent lawn reference may be made to edging a bed or edging the lawn along a walk the term can also be used to describe a product usually a steel or plastic strip that can be installed as a physical separator between planting beds and lawns or between lawns and paved areas to edge a bed requires an edging tool or a flatback spade the edger or spade is dug into the ground to a depth of six to eight inches and a wedge of sod removed figure 114 the process continues along the edge of the bed or the paved area cutting through the sod sharply and vertically discourages the roots of the turf from growing into the bed if the landscape is large edging can be accelerated by using a power edger the installation of edging material against the cut edge further discourages the horizontal spread of grass roots into the bed it also retains a sharp turf line along walks and drives the best edging materials are firm not easily bent and crushed the corrugated foil edging promoted to the home garden market is not satisfactory for professional use and should be avoided heavygauged steel and polyvinylchloride edging is available from numerous manufacturers satisfactory edges can also be created with wood bricks and other modular manufactured materials in regions where winter heaving of the soil is common it is best to select an edging material that can be anchored figure 115 most anchoring techniques are only moderately effective however and resetting heaved edging is a common spring activity in northern landscapes it is worth the effort considering the advantages that the material offers in retention of the bed line and separation of the mulch from the lawn mower,landscape plant maintenance is vital to achieve the lush mature look envisioned by landscape designers it includes several key tasks such as watering fertilizing mulching edging pruning pest control and winterization all contributing to plant health and aesthetic appeal watering should promote deep root development with infrequent thorough soaking preferred over shallow frequent watering fertilization strengthens plants making them more resilient and promoting lush growth but timing is crucial lateseason fertilization can spur growth too late in the year leaving plants vulnerable to winter damage mulching protects roots retains moisture and reduces weed growth but it must be maintainedreplaced annually for organic mulches and kept away from plant stems to prevent fungal issues edging creates sharp boundaries between planting beds and lawns enhancing the gardens appearance and protecting plants from lawnmower damage durable materials like steel or plastic are often used as edging to discourage grass roots from spreading into beds lastly pruning and pest control help maintain shape health and disease resistance while winterization prepares plants for cold months thoughtful consistent maintenance ensures a thriving attractive landscape for years to come
pest control chapter 6 deals with plant pests the symptoms of disease and injury that they create and the principles used to control them here the emphasis is given to the decisions that a landscaper or arborist must make to apply the knowledge of pest control to the maintenance and management of a landscape site it becomes a threepart judgment call what is the potential or actual extent of pest damage what is the quality expectation and or tolerance level of the client what are the environmental ramifications of the proposed method of control whether a professional landscaper or arborist a property manager or a home gardener answers the questions they must be answered in many cases the control methods used will be restricted or guided by local laws and regulations many states and communities ban or restrict the use of certain pesticides or limit the right to apply them to registered pesticide applicators those that are available for general purchase are increasingly limited and have diluted concentrations every state has a college of agriculture that is responsible for approving the use of every pesticide used within the state scientists at the colleges are also responsible for determining the appropriate product and formulation for use against a particular disease weed or insect on a particular host at a particular time of year or stage of development it is increasingly probable that their recommendations will incorporate the latest biological controls and ipm measures their recommendations are updated and published each year for use by the states professionals copies of the recommendations are available directly from the state universities and often from local cooperative extension offices everyone who uses pesticides must realize that although pest problems may be similar in different states and in different regions within a single state the environmental conditions can vary in subtle ways not always apparent therefore if a pesticide is not approved for use within a state or region it is dangerous unethical and illegal to purchase the product elsewhere and apply it in the restricted zone it is also equally dangerous and illegal to increase the dosage or frequency of application beyond that which is recommended managing the landscape in a manner that optimizes plant health is the best way to control pests avoiding the use of plants in locations that do not fit their cultural needs will also avoid the costs of labor and materials needed to control the predictable invasion of weeds that will flourish in those locations or the insects and pathogens that will find their way to the weakened hosts planted in unsuitable locations regular scouting of the landscape to monitor the presence numbers and stage of development of pests is another mandatory management task in order to determine what controls are needed where they are needed and when to apply them for maximum effectiveness pruning trees and shrubs pruning is the removal of a portion of a plant to improve its appearance and health and to control its growth and shape it is easily done but not so easily done correctly each time a bud or branch is removed from a plant it has a shortterm and longterm effect the shortterm effect is the way the plant looks immediately after pruning and perhaps through the remainder of the growing season the longterm effect is the way the plant appears after several seasons of growth without the part that has been pruned the tools landscape pruning tools are available in a range of sizes and qualities whether a hand tool or power tool all pruning tools share a common attribute they are sharp and must be used carefully with a vigilant regard for the safety of the user and others nearby the tools used by home gardeners landscape professionals and arborists include hand prunershand pruners are used to cut branches up to about 14 inch in diameter there are two styles in use one is like a pair of scissors in that it has two sharpened edges a blade and a curved anvil the other style has one sharpened blade and a flat straight anvil that it cuts against professional horticulturists generally prefer the scissortype hand pruner because it gives a more precise cut and is less likely to damage the plant tissue by squeezing against an unsharpened anvil lopper prunersalso available as scissor or straight anvil types loppers are used to cut branches having diameters up to about 12 inch loppers have longer handles than hand pruners that allows the user greater leverage and extended reach it also can result in damage to the tool and the plant if the long handles are used to twist off a partially cut branch if the loppers cannot make a quick clean cut through a branch a pruning saw should be used instead hedge shearsthese are the most taskspecific of all pruning tools they are used to shear and shape hedges with some secondary applicability to the shearing of plants used in formal settings hedge shears are available as a scissorlike hand tool or as a wandlike power tool hand pruning sawwhen a branch exceeds 12 inch in diameter it is important to use a saw not a hand pruner or lopper pruning saws are designed to cut live wood unlike carpenter saws that are made for dried wood hand pruning saws with straight blades cut best when pushed away from the user curved blade saws cut best when pulled toward the user the circumstances of use will usually dictate the proper choice of saw pole sawthis tool is simply a hand pruning saw or a lopper with a long handle it permits the user to reach up into a tree for the removal of the same sized branches that are removed at lower levels with regular handsaws or loppers caution it is difficult to see electric wires that may be in the canopy of trees do not cut until you are certain of what is being severed chainsawthis is a very dangerous tool it may be powered by gasoline or electricity and is used to remove branches that cannot be cut with the hand tools described razor sharp teeth attached to a chain cut through the wood protective clothing and a thorough knowledge of all safety measures regarding the use and maintenance of the chainsaw are essential other power prunersprofessional arborists have available an expanded assortment of tools that do the same tasks described for the hand tools but have the benefits of engine power to increase their strength and cut size capability powered forms of pole pruners and loppers are available these too are highly dangerous to use parts of a tree the following parts of a tree are important for an understanding of proper tree pruning figure 116 the lead branch of a tree is its most important branch it is dominant over the other branches called the scaffold branches the lead branch usually cannot be removed without destroying the distinctive shape of the tree this is especially true in young trees the scaffold branches create the canopy or foliage of the tree the amount of shade cast by the canopy is directly related to the number of scaffold branches and the size of the leaves when it becomes necessary to remove a branch from a tree removal usually occurs at a crotch the point at which a branch meets the trunk of the tree or another larger branch it is always desirable to leave the strongest branches and remove the weakest where the crotch union is wide approaching a right angle the branch is strong because there has been no crowding and pinching of the new wood produced each year by the cambiums of the trunk and branches where the crotch union is narrow the branch is weak due to a pinch point forming where the expanding trunk meets the expanding branch figure 117 growth in that area becomes compressed and dwarfed and the branch may snap off at that point during a heavy wind or in response to the weight of a person climbing on it two other types of branches often found on trees are suckers and water sprouts suckers originate from the underground root system water sprouts develop along the trunk and branches of a tree neither is desirable for an attractive tree and both should be removed parts of a shrub a shrub is a multistemmed plant figure 118 its branches and twigs differ in age with the best flower and fruit production usually on the younger branches the younger branches are usually distinguished by a lighter color thinner bark and smaller diameter the point at which the branches and the root system of a shrub meet is the crown new branches originate at the crown causing the shrub to grow wider new shoots may arise from existing roots or from prostrate stems termed stolons to create new shrubs from the parent plant in some grafted plants the graft union may be seen at or near the crown grafting is described in chapter 14 shoots originating from the stock or root portion of a grafted plant are cut away since the quality of their flowers fruit and foliage is inferior only shoots originating from the scion or shoot portion are allowed to develop the proper time to prune landscapers who design and install as well as maintain landscapes usually prefer to prune when they have little other work this distributes their work and income more evenly throughout the year some plants can accept this offseason attention and remain unaffected by it other species accept pruning only during certain periods of the year there are advantages and disadvantages to pruning in every season since seasons vary greatly from region to region the following can be used only as a general guide to the timing of pruning winter pruning winter pruning gives the landscaper offseason work it also allows a view of the plant unblocked by foliage broken branches are easily seen as are older and crossed branches the major disadvantage of winter pruning is that without foliage it is difficult to detect dead branches because of this plants can become seriously misshapen if the wrong branches are removed an additional disadvantage is the damage that can be done through cracking frozen plant parts summer pruning summer pruning also provides work during a slower season for the landscaper an advantage of summer pruning is that it allows time for all but very large wounds to heal before the arrival of winter the major limitation of summer pruning is that problems of plants may be concealed by their full foliage branches that should be removed are often difficult to see especially with trees it is difficult to shape the branching pattern unless all the limbs are visible autumn pruning pruning during the autumn season may conflict with more profitable tasks for the landscaper in terms of the health of the plant autumn pruning is acceptable as long as it is done early enough to allow cuts to heal before winter autumn pruning should not be attempted on plants that bloom very early in the spring however these early bloomers produce their flower buds the preceding fall thus fall pruning cuts away the flower buds and destroys the spring show autumn pruning should be reserved for plants that bloom in late spring or summer producing their buds in the spring of the year spring pruning since spring is the major planting season most landscapers do not welcome pruning requests unless maintenance is their principal business however most plants are most successfully pruned during the spring as buds begin to swell giving evidence of life it is clear which are the live and dead branches furthermore there is little foliage to block the view of the complete plant spring pruning provides the plant with maximum time for wounds to heal in addition the unfolding leaves conceal the fresh cuts from the viewers eye if the plant is an early spring bloomer it is best to prune it immediately after flowering plants that have a high sap pressure in the early spring such as maples birches walnut and poinsettias should not be pruned until summer or fall when the sap pressure is lower otherwise the excessive exudation becomes unsightly,pest control professionals such as landscapers and arborists must assess the potential or actual extent of pest damage while considering client expectations and environmental consequences of control methods local regulations significantly influence pesticide application with many states imposing restrictions on certain chemicals optimizing plant health through cultural practices and regular scouting for pests is crucial for effective management pruning trees and shrubs pruning is the selective removal of plant parts to improve their health and appearance proper tools include hand pruners loppers hedge shears and chainsaws each requiring careful handling to ensure safety understanding tree anatomy particularly the lead and scaffold branches is vital for making informed pruning decisions timing of pruning the timing of pruning impacts plant health winter allows visibility of branches but hidden dead wood may lead to improper cuts summer facilitates healing before winter but may conceal issues autumn is acceptable for certain plants while spring is ideal for most revealing dead branches and allowing maximum healing time however care is needed for species with high sap pressure
parts of the plant to prune the reason for pruning will determine the limbs and branches to be removed from a tree or shrub if the objective is to remove diseased portions the cut should be made through healthy wood between the trunk or crowns and the infected part figure 119 the cut should never be made through the diseased wood or very close to it this contaminates the pruning tool which may transmit the pathogen to healthy parts pruned later if the objective is to improve the overall health and appearance of the plant branches growing into the center of the plant should be removed limbs and twigs that grow across other branches can crowd the plant and cause sites of infection to form by rubbing abrasions through the bark if more than one limb originates at a tree crotch the strongest should be left and the others removed figure 1110 major structural limbs and twigs must be left so that no holes appear in the plant often overlooked is the fact that many secondary branches can stem from one older branch the removal of one branch from a young tree can result in an older tree missing an entire side if the purpose of the pruning is to create denser foliage as with evergreens the center shoot is shortened or removed this encourages the lateral buds to grow and create two shoots where there had been only one figure 1111 pruning methods the method of pruning a tree or shrub depends on the size and number of branches to be removed limbs are pruned from trees with a technique called jumpcutting this method allows a scaffold limb to be removed without taking a long slice of bark with it when it falls a jumpcut requires three cuts for the safe removal of a limb figure 1112 the final cut should remove the stub of the limb close to the trunk but not directly against it until recently the wound would then be covered with a wound paint to make it less conspicuous until the plant has time to heal however recent research has suggested that wound paints may actually delay healing of plant tissue where this is suspected the landscaper should not use them when shrubs are pruned one of two techniques is used thinning out is the removal of a shrub branch at or near the crown it is the major means of removing old wood from a shrub while retaining the desired shape and size heading back is the shortening rather than total removal of a twig it is a means of reducing the size of a shrub in cases where shrubs have become tall and sparse a combination of thinning out and heading back can rejuvenate an old planting figures 1113 and 1114 in heading back the location of the cut is important figure 1115 if too much wood is left above the bud the twig will die from the point of the cut back to the bud but the cut may not heal quickly enough to prevent insect and pathogen entry also the woody stub itself may decay later a cut below the bud will cause the bud to dry out and possibly die the cut should be made just above the bud and parallel to the direction in which the bud is pointing the cut should be close enough to the living tissue to heal over quickly but not so close to the bud that it promotes drying the direction in which the branch of a plant grows can be guided by good pruning techniques branches growing into the plant can be discouraged by the selection of an outwardpointing bud when heading back figure 1116 if the twig has an opposite bud arrangement the unnecessary one is removed how to prune hedges the creation of a hedge requires close spacing of the shrubs at the time of planting and a special type of pruning the landscaper must shear the plant so that it becomes as dense as possible this is usually done with hedge shears the hedge shears easily cut through the soft new growth of spring the season when most hedges are pruned for especially large hedges electric or gasoline powered shears are available however practice and skill are required for the satisfactory use of power shears damage can occur quickly if the landscaper does not keep the shears under control a properly pruned hedge is level on top and tapered on the sides figure 1117 it is important that sunlight be able to reach the lower portion of the hedge if it is to stay full otherwise it becomes leggy and topheavy in appearance national pruning standard recent cooperation between members of the arborist landscape and nursery industries and governmental organizations has resulted in the development of national pruning standards these standards are known as the american national standards institute ansi standards and seek to establish a level of acceptable performance for all professionals engaged in the care of woody plants flower plantings no components of the landscape require more maintenance time than flower plantings this is why landscapes with a low budget for maintenance must minimize the use of flowers reasons for the high maintenance costs are that weeds must be pulled by hand or controlled with costly selective herbicides flowers are more susceptible to insects and diseases that mar their aesthetic appearance therefore requiring additional expenditures for pesticides flowers tend to go to seed or get leggy with age if not pinched back frequently during the growing season this subject is discussed later in the chapter many perennials bloom only once a year but must be cared for throughout the growing season to ensure a good flower display the following year some perennials notably the tender bulbs must be dug up put into storage for the winter and set out again each spring weed control several good herbicides are approved for use in flower plantings if applied for preemergence and postemergence control a weedfree flower planting can be attained one danger of herbicides in flower beds is that the chemicals are always selective that is they kill grasses or broadleaved weeds but seldom both since flower plantings can have characteristics of both damage can be done to some flowers even when others are uninjured most herbicides used in flower plantings lose their effectiveness if the soil is disturbed after application in such cases landscapers must avoid cultivating the soil surface if they wish the full benefit of the herbicide watering all flowers should be watered frequently and deeply during dry periods their shallow roots quickly react to drought conditions and they reach a critical wilting point much sooner than the woody plants of the landscape flowers planted beneath trees and shrubs must compete with the woody plants for surface water and they will dry out faster than flowers not in such competitive locations fertilization annuals can be fertilized in midsummer with a lowanalysis fertilizer to keep them lush and healthy bulbs should be fertilized immediately after flowering with a highphosphorus fertilizer such as bone meal nonbulbous perennials grow best if fertilized in the early spring summer or fall fertilization of perennials can harm the plants by keeping them too succulent as winter approaches deadheading many summer annuals must be continuously tended to remove dead flower blossoms a practice termed deadheading plants such as petunias and geraniums are especially demanding combining deadheading with ipm scouting can reduce labor costs but requires floral crew workers to be knowledgeable of integrated pest management if it is to be cost effective pinching annuals are most likely to benefit from pinching back but certain perennials such as hardy mums will also do better if pinched pinching removes the terminal shoot on each branch of the flower and allows the lateral shoots to develop thereby creating a fuller plant soft pinching is done with the thumb and forefinger and removes the terminal bud or at the most the terminal bud and first set of laterals hard pinching may shorten each stem by one third or more most flowers benefit by a hard pinch soon after being set out followed by one or two soft pinches during the summer with perennials such as mums whose flower bud initiation is tied to a photoperiod response the last pinch should not be after midjuly if a good flower display is to be seen in the autumn flowers such as petunias or rose moss that are valued for their profuse blossoms can be kept from getting leggy and going to seed by severely cutting them back about midsummer a tool as indelicate as a pair of grass clippers can be used to provide a hard pinch if the planting is extensive a period of several weeks with few flowers will follow until new reproductive growth begins however the fresh look and new flowers that result will carry the annuals right into the fall season,pruning is essential for maintaining the health and appearance of trees and shrubs the reasons for pruning dictate which branches to remove disease management cut through healthy wood avoiding the diseased area to prevent contamination of tools health improvement remove inwardgrowing branches and overcrowded twigs to promote airflow and prevent infection foliage density for evergreens shorten central shoots to encourage lateral growth pruning methods jumpcutting a technique for limb removal that prevents bark damage requiring three cuts for safety thinning out removes branches near the crown to retain shape heading back shortens twigs promoting bushier growth hedge maintenance shear hedges for density ensuring proper sunlight exposure to prevent legginess flower plantings these require high maintenance due to the susceptibility of flowers to weeds pests and diseases key maintenance practices include weed control use selective herbicides carefully to avoid damage to flowers watering regular deep watering is crucial especially during dry periods fertilization fertilize at appropriate times for healthy growth deadheading regularly remove dead blossoms to encourage new growth pinching removes terminal buds to promote fuller plants understanding these practices ensures effective plant management and aesthetic appeal in gardens
winterizing the landscape winter injury is any damage done to the landscape during the cold season of the year the injury may be due to natural causes or to human error it may be predictable or totally unexpected at times winter injury can be avoided whereas at other times it can only be accepted and dealt with it affects most elements of the outdoor room plants paving steps furnishings and plumbing are all susceptible to damage this discussion will center around the types of winter injury common to plants however it is important for the landscaper to guard against winter injury to all elements of the garden there are two general categories of winter injury natural and humaninduced the examples that follow are common to most landscapes where the winter is severe natural injuries windburn windburn can result when evergreens are exposed to strong prevailing winds throughout the winter months the wind dries out the leaf tissue and the dehydrated tissue dies windburn causes a brown to black discoloration of the leaves on the windward side of the plant very often leaves further into the plant or on the side opposite the wind show no damage broadleaved evergreens are highly susceptible to windburn because they have a great amount of leaf surface responding to dropping temperatures many broadleaved evergreens roll their leaves in the winter to reduce the amount of exposed surface area figure 1118 damage from temperature extremes temperature extremes are injurious to plants that are at the limit of their hardiness termed marginally hardy damage may range from stunting when all of the previous seasons young growth freezes to death of the plant if the severely cold weather is prolonged after an especially cold winter certain plants may show no sign of injury except that their spring flower display is absent this happens if the plants flower buds have frozen while the leaf buds have not the injury is common to forsythia and certain spireas in the northern states unusually warm weather during late winter can also cause plant damage fruit trees may be encouraged to bloom prematurely only to have their flowers killed by a late frost as a result the fruit harvest can be greatly reduced or even eliminated springflowering bulbs can also be disfigured if forced into bloom by warm weather followed by freezing winds and snow sun scald sun scald is a special type of temperaturerelated injury it occurs when extended periods of warm winter sunshine thaw the aboveground portions of a plant but the period of warmth is too brief to thaw the root system above ground the thawed plant parts require water which the frozen roots are unable to provide consequently the tissue dries out and a scald results sun scald is especially troublesome on evergreens planted on the south side of a building it also occurs on newly transplanted young trees in a similar location the thin young bark scalds easily and the moisture content of the tissue is already low because of the reduced root system heaving when the ground freezes and thaws repeatedly because of winter temperature fluctuations turfgrass bulbs and other perennials can be subject to heaving and forced up from the soil when their roots are exposed to the drying winter wind they are killed damage from ice and snow the sheer weight of snow and ice on plant limbs and twigs can cause breakage and result in permanent destruction of the plants natural shape evergreens are most easily damaged because they hold heavy snow more readily than leafless deciduous plants figures 1119a and b snow or ice falling off a pitched roof can split foundation plants in seconds figure 1120 plants that freeze before snow settles on them are even more likely to be injured because freezing reduces plant flexibility causing twigs to snap rather than bend under added weight unfortunately the older and larger a plant becomes the greater the damage resulting from heavy snowfalls and ice storms there have been accounts of severe winter storms destroying the entire street trees of cities damage from animals lacking other food in winter small animals often feed on the tender twigs and bark of plants especially shrubs bulbs are also susceptible entire floral displays can be destroyed by the winter feeding of small rodents shrubs can be distorted and stunted by the removal of all young growth in places where the plant becomes girdled it is unable to transport nutrients and will eventually die humaninduced injuries certain types of injury are inflicted by human beings during wintertime landscape maintenance some types of injury result from carelessness on the part of groundkeepers other types are the predictable result of poor landscape design a large number occur because the landscape elements are hidden beneath piles of snow damage from salt salt is toxic to nearly all plant life when salt is applied to melt winter ice it can harm trees shrubs bulbs and lawns as well as paving often the damage does not appear until long after the winter season has passed and the cause of the injury may go undiagnosed the injury may appear as strips of sterile barren soil paralleling walks where salt was applied burn injury also can be seen on the lower branches of evergreens some sensitive plants weaken and die after several winters of excessive salt runoff damage from snowplows snowplows can damage plant and construction materials in several ways a plow operator may be careless or unfamiliar with the landscape and push snow onto a planting or a bench on the other hand poor design may have placed plants and other vulnerable elements too close to walks parking areas or streets where they interfere with winter snow removal damage to lawns can result when the plow misses the walk and actually plows the grass the turf may not survive if this occurs repeatedly rutting of lawns when the surface layer of the soil thaws but the subsoil remains frozen surface water is unable to soak in users of the landscape accustomed to finding the ground firm may be unaware of the damage they cause by parking their vehicles on temporarily soft lawns the soil can become badly compacted resulting in unsightly ruts reducing winter injury some types of winter damage can be eliminated by winterizing the landscape during the preceding autumn other types can be reduced by better design of the grounds still other winter injuries can only be minimized never totally eliminated windburn windburn can be eliminated in the design stage of landscaping by selecting deciduous species rather than evergreens for windy corners and other exposed locations if evergreens are important to the design or already exist in the garden windburn can be reduced by wrapping the plant in burlap during the winter figure 1121 applying antitranspirants in the autumn and again in late winter to reduce water loss from the tissue the use of anitranspirants is more practical for large evergreens than wrapping in very cold regions both techniques may be applied to certain plants damage from temperature extremes temperature extremes can only be partially guarded against where wind chill is a factor plants should be located in a protected area burlap wrapping also helps especially with hardy species that have tender flower buds certain plants such as roses can be cut back in the autumn and their crowns mulched heavily to insulate them against the effects of winter similarly any plant that can be damaged by freezing and thawing of the soil should be heavily mulched after the ground has frozen to insulate against premature thawing to prolong the life of annual flowers in the autumn when a frost is forecast the foliage can be sprinkled with water prior to nightfall the water will give off heat as it changes from liquid to ice and can keep the plant tissue from freezing if the temperature does not go too low for too long sun scald sun scald of transplants lessens as plants grow older and form thicker bark wrapping the trunks of young trees with paper or burlap stripping can provide an effective protection during the first year or two after transplanting for other types of sun scald such as that which affects broadleaved evergreens the same remedies practiced for windburn and temperature extremes are effective some sun scald can be avoided by the landscape designer vulnerable species of plants should not be placed on the south side of a building nor should they be placed against a white wall that will magnify the suns effect on the aboveground plant parts heaving heaving of the turf is impossible to prevent completely the best defense against it is to encourage deep rooting through deep watering properly timed fertilization and correct cutting bulbs groundcovers and other perennials can be protected from heaving by application of a mulch after the ground has frozen the mulch acts to insulate the soil against surface thawing damage from ice and snow ice and snow damage to foundation plants can be avoided if the designer is careful not to specify plants beneath the overhanging roof line of buildings if the groundskeeper must deal with plants already existing in an overhang area the use of hinged wooden aframes over the plants can help protect them figure 1122 as large pieces of frozen snow and ice tumble off the roof the frame breaks them apart before they can damage the plants to aid plants that have been split or bent by heavy snow accumulation the groundskeeper must work quickly and cautiously a broom can be used to shake snow off weighted branches but this must be done gently and immediately after the snow stops if the branches are frozen or the snow has become hard and icy removal efforts may do more harm than good if plant breakage occurs during the winter the groundskeeper should prune the damaged part as soon as possible this reduces the possibility of further damage to the plants during the remainder of the winter large and valuable plants in the landscape can be winterized in the autumn by tying them loosely with strips of burlap or twine do not use wire when prepared in this manner the branches cannot be forced apart by heavy snow and splitting is avoided damage from animals animal damage can be prevented either by eliminating the animals or by protecting the plants from their feeding while rats mice moles and voles are generally regarded as offensive plantings are damaged as much or more by deer rabbits chipmunks and other more attractive kinds of animals certain rodenticides may be employed against some of the undesirable animals that threaten the landscape in situations in which the animals are welcome but their winter feeding damage is not a protective enclosure of fine mesh wire fencing or a hard plastic coil around the plants helps to discourage animals from feeding there figure 1123 nontoxic liquid repellants can also be applied to the base of trees and shrubs in the fall to discourage animal feeding damage from salt salt injury to turf adjacent to walks can be minimized if caution is exercised by the groundskeeper salt mixed with coarse sand does a better job than either material used separately and reduces the total quantity of salt applied the sand provides traction on icy walks and a small amount of salt can melt a large amount of ice damage from snowplows snowplow damage is to be expected if plants are too close to walks and roadways therefore when planning landscapes for snowy climates the designer should avoid placing shrubs near intersections or other places where snow is likely to be pushed another type of damage results from the plow drivers inability to see objects beneath the snow if possible all plants and other objects that cannot be removed for winter should be marked with tall colored poles that can be seen above the snow whenever possible snow blowers should be used instead of plows these machines are much less likely to cause damage rutting of lawns rutting of lawns usually results from cars parked there the best solution to the problem is to avoid the practice otherwise sawhorses or other barriers offer a temporary solution,soil nutrients are critical for plant growth with green plants needing 17 essential elements these elements are divided into macronutrients required in large quantities like nitrogen and phosphorus and micronutrients needed in smaller amounts such as iron and zinc plants primarily obtain carbon hydrogen and oxygen from air and water while the remaining essential nutrients are absorbed from the soil beneficial elements like silica sodium cobalt and selenium support growth but are not universally essential soil structure particularly in loam balances water retention and aeration with organic matter such as humus and decomposed roots enhancing structure by forming aggregates soil ph a measure of acidity or alkalinity is crucial as it influences nutrient availability acidic soils have more hydrogen ions h while alkaline soils contain more hydroxyl ions oh adjusting ph can improve crop growth though soils with strong buffering resistance may resist ph changes cation exchange the soils ability to hold and swap positively charged ions plays a key role in retaining nutrients and reducing leaching mineral absorption into roots occurs through ion and contact exchanges where specific ions are exchanged or absorbed allowing plants to uptake necessary nutrients efficiently
special training techniques for plants selecting and using vines in the landscape vines are plants with a vigorous central lead shoot and a long linear growth habit they do not grow naturally into clumped shrublike forms and are seldom able to grow upright without support they may be either woody or herbaceous vines are among the most versatile plants that can be selected for use in the landscape given the opportunity to climb they form interesting walls for the outdoor room allowed to trail they carpet the outdoors with rich and varied textures if trained to grow on a trellis or along a fence they can be controlled to create various effects envisioned by a designer left to grow naturally they lend charm and softening qualities to a landscape that might otherwise appear too contrived vines are especially useful where height is needed from a plant but a narrow planting space makes trees or shrubs impossible table 95 in chapter 9 lists some of the more common vines available for use in landscapes vines climb in one of three ways depending on the species figure 121 1 some climb by twining themselves around a trellis fence or another plant 2 others produce fine tendrils that wrap around the supporting structure and allow the vine to climb 3 still other vines produce holdfasts that permit the plant almost to glue itself to the support a landscaper should be aware of the climbing methods of each species being considered for use in the landscape before making a final selection damage to buildings can result from excessive moisture retention caused by vines growing against an unsuitable surface or from pitting of the surface by the vines holdfasts as with trees and shrubs vines can be deciduous or evergreen flowering or nonflowering dense or sparse many people avoid using vines because of their maintenance requirements they do require some special attention if maximum flowering is to be obtained or if vigorous growth is to be kept under control however to avoid their use is to deprive the garden of one of its most contributive elements figure 122 factors to consider when choosing vines include does the vine need a sheltered location or can it survive hardiness an open location although many flowering vines will survive on sun orientation a northfacing wall they do not flower satisfactorily and their vegetation may be sparse it is unwise to select a vigorous species amount of coverage desired where only a tracework of vine is desired will a trellis be required or amount and type of support required does the species climb unaided installing and training vines the installation and training of vines will be discussed in three stages planting initial training and developmental pruning planting vines are usually sold as containerized plants the method of installation described for containerized trees and shrubs is also applicable to the installation of vines points specific to vine planting have to do with the vines need for support even if the vine is to grow vertically it should not be placed directly against the support the soil next to a building wall or even around a fence post is often drier than the surrounding soil therefore a foot of space should be left between the support structure and the new vine if the vine is a species that climbs by holdfasts it will need no additional support however if the vine climbs by twining or tendrils it will need support in the form of a trellis or wire fencing to climb an open style of fencing support assistance is seldom needed after the initial training where a trellis or support fence is required it must be in place before the vine is planted the support must be strong enough to hold the mature vine with its fruit if necessary or when it is covered with heavy snow the support must also be securely anchored so that it does not become a sail when the wind blows initial training the initial training of a vine is intended to direct and accelerate its coverage this may involve tying the shoots of twining and tendril species to the support holdfastproducing vines will not need to be tied shoots that grow outward from the wall or support should be pruned off only lateral shoots growing parallel to the support should be permitted to develop if the young vine does not have several vigorous shoots at its base at the time of planting it should be pruned back to the lowest pair of healthy buds from these buds several vigorous shoots will develop which can then be tied or otherwise directed application of a complete lowanalysis fertilizer to the vine during its first spring of new growth and deep watering to promote deep rooting will ensure a successful beginning for the vine developmental pruning developmental pruning is usually necessary if the vines full potential is to be realized the amount of work required depends on the species if the vine climbs by holdfasts and total wall coverage is the only objective little attention is needed except the removal of dead or damaged shoots and those extending too far outward from the wall if the pattern of growth is to be more restricted and defined the vine is likely to require regular pruning once or twice annually if profuse flowering is desired young wood must be encouraged and unruly older nonflowering shoots must be pruned away severe pruning can cut away key tendrils or entwined branches that support the vine however even vines that climb easily may need to be tied to the support in strategic places to guard against falling after a heavy pruning since vines like trees and shrubs flower at different times of the year they cannot all be pruned at the same time if the flower display is to be encouraged table 121 provides a general timetable for pruning espaliers among the horticultural contrivances of gardeners over their centuries of cultivating ornamental plants are espaliers espaliers are trees and shrubs that are allowed to develop only two dimensionally they have height and width but hardly any depth figure 123 in appearance they may suggest a vine to the viewer because of their flatness whereas vines are a natural growth form of plants espaliers are entirely created by gardeners and must rely totally on continuing human attention to exist in their unusual form espaliers were originally developed as a way of incorporating into gardens desirable fruiting species such as apples pears and peaches without giving them a lot of space the trees were trained against courtyard walls and along fences they were even developed inside early orangeries see chapter 20 and in greenhouses later other species were tried and found usable solely for their decorative effect espaliers are most commonly grown against walls or fences for two reasons 1 the support is convenient and necessary for initial training of the young plant 2 the wall provides a good background for viewing the plant and its branching pattern although a decorative branching pattern is not necessary it is traditional and over the years some attractive and clever styles have been developed it is possible for certain tree espaliers to be freestanding however figure 124 as elements of the landscape espaliers serve as novelties since they are not commonplace plant forms if used correctly they can function as focal points or as accent features against a garden wall their uses are similar to those of decorative vines yet they have a distinctively different appearance installing and training espaliers the espalier begins its training as a oneyearold tree or shrub with no developed lateral shoots at its base it may be planted against a wall initially and a support frame set behind it or it may be grown in a container for several years with a training frame inserted into the container the plant is installed like any other tree or shrub set about 12 inches from the wall fence or lattice that is to support it at the time of installation the plant should be dormant figure 125 step 1 select an unbranched oneyearold plant and install while it is dormant prune back the single stem to a height of 15 to 18 inches allow three healthy buds to remain near the top of the cut stem the lower two must point in opposite directions step 2 after the shoots break dormancy train the top shoot to grow vertically and the lower two shoots to grow horizontally the shoots may be supported with bamboo stakes tied to the support frame in the first growing season for each set of horizontal branches train and tie the branches at 45 angles rather than full 90 angles remove any lateral shoots growing outward from the wall and cut back any vertical shoots from the horizontal branches to allow only two or three nodes on each vertical spur step 3 at the end of the growing season the two horizontal shoots now branches should be removed from the bamboo stakes and tied to the frame at 90 angles step 4 after the plant has gone dormant again prune the central branch back to a point 15 to 18 inches above the horizontal branches allow three more healthy buds to remain near the top of the cut stem the lower two must point in opposite directions prune back both of the horizontal branches about onethird a downward oriented bud should be left at each cut lateral buds along the main trunk should be reduced to three or four not counting the three at the top which will form the new branches during the next growing season step 5 repeat these steps until the plant attains the height and width desired after that little or no additional extension of the framework branches should be permitted they can be kept pruned back to the previous years terminal points should the support frame or trellis weaken over time the espalier can be attached to the wall with special nails part steel and part pliable lead the steel end is driven into the wall and the pliable portion is hooked around the branch of the plant horticulturists with enthusiasm and opportunity for espalier training have developed numerous complicated style variations figure 126 single double and triple ushapes horizontal palmette verrier palmette oblique fan shape belgian fence losange freestanding spiral freestanding pyramidal truly espalier training is one of the highest manifestations of the horticulturists skills,special training techniques for plants vines and espaliers vines in the landscape vines are adaptable plants with a central lead shoot and a linear growth habit requiring support to climb they can be woody or herbaceous and serve various landscaping purposes such as creating vertical elements or softening structures vines can climb by twining using tendrils or producing holdfasts when selecting vines factors like hardiness sun orientation desired coverage and support needs are crucial while they demand maintenance to promote flowering and manage growth their beauty and utility are invaluable in garden design installing and training vines plant vines with adequate spacing from supports to prevent moisture retention initial training involves tying shoots to supports and pruning unwanted growth developmental pruning is essential for encouraging flowering and controlling the vines shape with timing based on the species blooming schedule espaliers espaliers are twodimensional forms of trees and shrubs trained against walls or fences they require careful pruning and training to achieve a decorative appearance making them unique focal points in gardens this method not only saves space but also showcases creative horticultural skills
topiary pruning equally clever difficult and historic is the ancient craft of topiary pruning figure 127 topiary is a technique of shearing plants into nontypical shapes usually sculptural in form begun centuries ago when nature had been tamed far less than today topiary was an attempt to illustrate human dominance over nature once entire gardens were created where no plants were permitted to develop natural shapes the english yew was the plant most often selected for topiary shaping and there are historic gardens throughout britain and europe whose topiary yews date back hundreds of years other species of plants have been tried with varying degrees of satisfaction whatever the species used it must be one that accepts repeated pruning with little or no growth permitted after the desired shape is attained species that do not produce new growth on old wood are unsuitable as topiaries topiaries are garden novelties as are espaliers they have been shaped into forms as fantastic as the imaginations of the horticulturists corkscrews chess pieces chairs peacocks tables and countless animals are but a few of the subjects chosen figure 128 one famous amusement park has created dozens of modern topiaries in the shapes of characters from animated films historic techniques of topiary pruning required time patience and complicated training techniques if the winter season was harsh a section of plant could be killed leaving a peacock without a tail or some similar tragedy in such cases then as now there was no alternative to rebuilding the plant from new shoots or by grafting with predictable impatience modern gardeners sometimes wish to create the effects of topiary without the lengthy wait they use more rapidly growing species such as the privets which accept severe pruning and recover quickly they plant the rapidly growing species inside wired forms that are commercially available as the plant fills the form the gardener shears the plant back to the wire form creating a fuller plant and a satisfactory topiary in a relatively short period of time with relatively little skill another modern variation on the topiary of old uses a vine such as english ivy and a mold of sphagnum moss the ivy is encouraged to grow over the form which rapidly disappears from sight leaving some curiosity such as an ivycovered french poodle in its place figure 129 topiary pruning has existed for a long time it comes in and out of fashion depending on current attitudes toward formal garden design it has ties to our modern clipped hedges and to the japanese craft of cloud pruning suggesting tufts of clouds in a garden by the manner of pruning certain shrubs yet it remains a unique and distinctive use of plants bonsai development bonsai is the ancient japanese craft of dwarfing trees forest giants such as pines maples beeches and spruces have been successfully maintained in shallow containers for a hundred years or more while restricted to a height of mere inches figures 1210 and 1211 in the hands of a skilled bonsaist the containerized tree acquires a mature appearance but in miniature the same shaping molding and damage by wind and storms that determine the noble often craggy character of a tree in nature are interpreted in the bonsai so much of the japanese concept of landscape gardening is related to the symbolism of nature in miniature see chapter 9 that their fondness for bonsai is understandable even more than espalier or topiary bonsai requires time and patience figure 1212 all bonsais require several years even to begin developing a shape suggestive of a fullsized tree many successful bonsais outlive the gardeners who work with them therefore the ancient bonsai trees have been developed and cared for by a series of horticulturists each one appreciative and respectful of the work done on the plant in the past obviously bonsai development is not easy although it has great popular appeal it has proved too timeconsuming for most hobbyists to pursue also many people believing the bonsai to be a houseplant have been disappointed when it responded to its place of honor on the coffee table by dying most modern homes are too warm too dry and too dimly lit for the traditional woody species of the temperate zone to survive as bonsais more recently species from the subtropics and tropics have been tested as bonsai plants and many have proved highly satisfactory at least for the western market bonsai purists would probably not approve use of traditional temperatezone woody species for bonsais necessitates that they be treated in some ways like other woody plants they must be kept outdoors most of the time perhaps on the patio or porch and only brought in occasionally for indoor display they may need a period of dormancy during the winter but will not tolerate severely cold weather for extended periods during their indoor visits bonsais need plenty of light cool daytime temperatures about 68 f and even cooler temperatures at night from 62 to 65 f whether temperatezone trees or houseplants are selected the bonsai usually begins its development as a seedling or sapling although it is possible to use a commercially produced containerized nursery shrub or to collect from the wild a few nurseries specialize in the production of young plants suitable for bonsai development tools containers and soil mix special bonsai tools are available but a beginner can easily assemble the following assortment scissors pruning shears copper wire a wire cutter a strong thin stick such as a knitting needle or chopstick bonsais can be started in ordinary clay pots or even greenhouse flats repotting is one of the requisites of successful bonsai development so a more stylish container can be selected later ultimately the container will play an important role in complimenting the style of the bonsai and determining its size cascading forms will require a taller container to permit the descending branching habit forms that are more suggestive of old upright trees will require a wide shallow container in every case the bonsai container should not be overly decorative and what decoration exists should suggest the orient if it is to be in character with the plant also the containers should have drainage holes in the bottom or be able to be drilled without breaking unglazed pottery makes an ideal container if all other characteristics are present to prevent the loss of soil from the container the drainage holes should be covered with screen wire metal mesh or hardware cloth which can be taped in place with florists waterproof adhesive tape soil for the bonsai must drain well a mixture of equal parts of coarse sand peat moss and loam will be satisfactory each soil component should be put through a finemesh sieve before mixing to remove the smallest particles that can plug the containers drainage holes the soil should also be pasteurized before use to kill weed seeds and soilborne pests the soil is most easily prepared and used while it is dry gravel spread on the bottom of the container before adding the soil will aid drainage styles of bonsai since a bonsai symbolizes a larger tree the most popular styles can be anticipated by recalling how trees grow naturally most grow upright of course but under various environmental conditions trees are seen to cascade over embankments perhaps as the soil erodes away from their roots lean away from a strong wind or clutch a mountainside they are also found as single perfect specimens or in groups in which each individuals appearance is lost in the larger shape of the grove figure 1213 beginning and wiring the bonsai the plant should be shaped before it is placed in the container the shallow root system does not permit pruning of the plant until it has time to establish itself in the container the bonsaist first selects the style that the plant is to attain branches important to the shape are retained others are pruned away if cuts are extensive a wound paint may be used if the formal upright style is selected the branches will need to be evenly distributed around the plant with closely spaced internodes branches must be pruned so that they are largest and longest at the base and get shorter and smaller as they approach the top of the plant the central branch must be straight and strong in informal uprights the tapered branch selection is the same but the central branch can be crooked slanted or cascading styles often have three major branches representing heaven earth and man a relationship that is spiritually ingrained in the oriental tradition heaven is always the uppermost branch earth is the lowest branch and man is the middle branch other branches may exist on the bonsai but they are not permitted to compete with the major three cascade styles of bonsai are onesided styles so the branches should be selected with that in mind other styles are not so flat although many will have a preferred direction or side for viewing figure 1214 it is unlikely that the plant will have the desired shape with each branch in its proper place after the first pruning wiring will be needed to direct the plants growth as the style develops copper wire of different gauges is used because copper is pliable and weathers quickly to a neutral unobjectionable appearance wiring should be started at the bottom of the tree and worked upward figures 1215 and 1216 heavygauge wire should be used to direct the trunk the end of the wire should be anchored by insertion several inches into the soil ball then evenly spaced and parallel coils of wire should be wrapped around the trunk at approximately oneinch intervals the trunk wire should stop just short of where the branches meet the trunk to allow the thinner wire used for the branches to be anchored around the trunk the branch wire should first be anchored to the trunk then wrapped in coils that match and parallel those on the trunk the finest gauge wire should be used to direct the thin twigs it should be anchored to a branch before beginning the coiling not all bonsais require the wiring of all three parts trunk branches and twigs pruning the roots and potting the bonsai before the new plant is placed in its container and each time it is repotted in the years that follow the root system must be reduced restricting the root system to a size that will sustain the plant without encouraging vigorous growth is critical to the bonsai technique such pruning maintains the vital support relationship between the aboveground and belowground parts of the plant using a long stick probe the soil ball until the soil has fallen away from the outer roots and they are hanging free cut away these roots continue until the soil ball and root mass are reduced to a size that will fit into the container chosen it is easiest to do this when the soil is dry and important not to disturb the soil directly beneath and around the trunk young fibrous roots will develop within the soil ball figure 1217 each spring the bonsai can be lifted from its container and a similar treatment given to the root system this will prevent the plant from becoming potbound and will also permit wires to be removed or added the bonsai should be set in its container off center and to the rear the dry pasteurized soil mix can then be added taking care to avoid air pockets around the roots some of the plants older roots may protrude above the soil that is acceptable even desirable since it adds to the illusion that the tree is old at least a quarterinch of space should be left below the top of the container for watering,topiary pruning and bonsai development topiary pruning topiary pruning is the art of shaping plants into decorative forms reflecting human creativity in gardening originating centuries ago topiary often uses english yew due to its tolerance for repeated pruning the goal is to maintain the desired shape while preventing new growth on old wood historically gardeners shaped various imaginative forms from animals to abstract designs while traditional techniques required time and skill modern gardeners often utilize fastgrowing species like privets training them in wired frames for quicker results topiarys popularity fluctuates with garden design trends connecting to formal hedges and japanese cloud pruning bonsai development bonsai is the ancient japanese practice of cultivating miniature trees emphasizing patience and artistry utilizing species like pines and maples bonsai artists shape plants to mimic mature trees creating a living art form successful bonsai require specific care including outdoor placement for traditional species and suitable lighting for indoor environments essential tools include pruning shears and copper wire for shaping root pruning is vital for maintaining the balance between growth and container size and the aesthetic design is influenced by natural tree growth patterns
turf selection establishment and maintenance the many uses of turfgrass turfgrasses appear at both ends of a landscape time spectrum they are among the oldest species used by human beings to fashion the outdoors into residential and recreational areas that suit their needs they are also responsible for one of the newest and most rapidly expanding branches of todays landscape industry selected as the most suitable surfacing for historic bowling greens and golf courses turfgrasses have carpeted the outdoor rooms of cottages and castles for centuries today fullservice lawn care corporations are leading profit makers among landscape professionals the main reason for the ongoing interest in turfgrass and improved turf care is that nothing has ever surpassed a topquality lawn as the ideal outdoor surfacing it is comfortable to walk on suitable for numerous athletic activities ideal for picnic blankets and sunning and it collects and holds dust and dirt from the air absorbs sound and produces oxygen following are the major categories of use and a few examples of each private homes estates apartment and residential use condominium complexes campuses corporate landscapes shopping centers office commercial use buildings civic buildings community centers highway municipal use dividers airports parks golf courses country clubs stadiums recreational use athletic fields the diversity of uses is immediately apparent turf may function almost solely in an aesthetic capacity as when it is the setting for a corporate giant other uses are utilitarian as on a football field no single turfgrass is suitable for all landscapes geographic regions soil types altitudes and environmental conditions correct selection of turfgrass for a landscape requires knowledge of all these factors comparison of turfgrasses turfgrasses are monocotyledonous plants having only one seed leaf in the embryo whose growing point is at the crown near the soil this low and protected location of the growing point permits turfgrasses to be mown and walked on repeatedly most turfgrasses used in landscapes nationwide are perennial although there are several annual species of significance most species reproduce from seed although several are propagated vegetatively a typical grass plant produces new leaves continuously from its growing point throughout the growing season it also loses about the same number of older leaves through natural senescence and death whether growing naturally or under cultivation turfgrasses will increase beyond the number of seeds sown one of the objectives of good turfgrass management is to encourage that growth as quickly and as uniformly as possible growth habit grasses have differing growth habits resulting from the three different ways that they produce new shoots figure 131 1 the shoots are produced rhizomeproducing rhizomatous beneath the soils surface and send new plants to the surface some distance out from the parent plant the new plant develops its own root system and is independent of the parent plant although the physical bond through the rhizome may continue 2 the shoots are produced and stolonproducing stoloniferous extend outward from the parent plant along the surface of the soil not beneath it the new plant develops independently as in rhizomeproducing plants 3 new lateral shoots termed tillers are produced from bunchtype axillary buds within the leaf sheath rhizomatous and stoloniferous grasses tend to reproduce more quickly and evenly than bunchtype grasses therefore the bunchtypes require more seed and closer spacing in order to cover an area quickly and avoid clumps in the lawn texture color and density leaf texture is mostly a measure of the width of the leaf blade the wider the blade the coarser the texture generally the finetextured grasses are regarded as more attractive than the coarsetextured grasses the color of a grass and its density will also differ among species color variance runs the full range of greens from pastel to dark and bluish density refers to the number of aerial leaf shoots that a single plant or species will produce seed size seed size varies greatly among grass species finetextured grasses have small seeds coarsetextured grass seeds usually are much larger a pound of finetextured grass seed contains considerably more seeds than a pound of coarsetextured grass seed a pound of finetextured grass seed will also cover a larger area of land for example a pound of finetextured kentucky bluegrass contains approximately 2000000 seeds that number of seeds will plant about 500 square feet of lawn a pound of coarsetextured tall fescue contains about 227000 seeds only 166 square feet of lawn can be planted with this particular seed to further illustrate the differences in seed sizes there are as many seeds in one pound of bluegrass as there are in nine pounds of ryegrass and as many seeds in one pound of bentgrass as there are in 230 pounds of ryegrass soil and climatic tolerance most grasses do best in soil that is moderately fertile neutral to slightly acidic wellaerated and moist and welldrained nevertheless there are sites in every state and county that fall short of those ideal conditions some species can adapt to a wide range of soil conditions whereas others are very limited in adaptability similarly some grasses tolerate high humidity and reduced sunlight others do not some prefer droughty climates most do not some thrive in the subtropics and tropics and others are better suited for temperate and subarctic regions grasses are often grouped into two categories based on the temperatures at which they grow best 1 are favored by daytime temperatures of 60 coolseason grasses to 75 f 2 are favored by daytime temperatures of 80 warmseason grasses to 95 f knowledge of their preferred growing temperatures explains why lawns in northern states are often brown and dormant in midsummer when the days are very warm in early spring and late fall when temperatures in the southern states drop warmseason grasses do not flourish there figures 132 and 133 use tolerance under any given conditions of use some grasses will hold up and others will quickly wear away some will accept heavy use and recuperate quickly and others will rebound much more slowly some can accept the compaction of heavy foot traffic and still look good and others discolor and slow their rate of growth markedly disease and insect resistance as turfgrasses have become more important to people their growth in large monocultures as on golf courses or sod farms has increased the probability of infestation or infection by insects or pathogens breeding for resistance is an ongoing effort of horticulture scientists certain cultivars enjoy widespread use for a while until their resistance is overcome by a new mutant of an old pest in table 131 on page 346 many of the most commonly used turfgrasses are compared purchasing grass seed grass seed is sold in small quantities through retail outlets such as garden centers supermarkets hardware stores and department stores it is also sold in bulk amounts through wholesale suppliers professional landscapers park and recreation specialists and other industry horticulturists usually purchase seed wholesale however because most clients have had the experience of purchasing seed from a retailer in which packaging product claims and prices can be very confusing landscapers need to know how grass seed mixtures differ in order to explain to clients why a seemingly more expensive seed may be needed for the landscape the confusion confusion often results from retail packaging with bright colors and names that seem to promise success such as suregrow easy lawn play lawn and shade mix when these are stocked next to smaller bags of seed that cost twice as much the untrained consumer predictably will be attracted to the one that seems to offer the most for the least the solution the key to the mystery is the seed analysis label by law the seed analysis label must appear on every package of seed sold if the seed is sold in bulk amounts the analysis will be printed on a tag tied to the handle of the storage container although legal requirements vary somewhat from state to state most analysis labels contain the following information purity purity is the percentage by weight of pure grass seed the label must show the percentage by weight of each species of grass in the mixture this allows the consumer to compare the permanent with the nonpermanent grasses and the finetextured with the coarsetextured grasses percent germination this is the percentage of the pure seed that was capable of germination on the date tested the date of testing is important and must be shown if several months have passed since the germination test the seed is less likely to germinate at the percentage indicated crop seed this is the percentage by weight of cash crop seeds in the mixture these are undesirable species for lawns weeds this is the percentage by weight of weed seeds in the mixture a seed qualifies as a weed seed if it has not been counted as a pure seed or crop seed noxious weeds this is usually the number of noxious weed seeds per pound or ounce of weed seeds noxious weeds are those extremely undesirable and difficult to eradicate inert material this is the percentage by weight of material in the package that will not grow in lowpriced seed mixes it includes materials such as sand chaff or ground corncobs inert material may be added to make the seed package look bigger or it may already be present in the seed and not be removed because the cost involved would raise the price of the seed seed analysis the percentage of pure live seed pls can be calculated by multiplying the percent purity of desirable species percent p and the percent viability percent v for example a seed lot costing 250 per pound with 93 percent finetextured seeds and 85 percent germination viability has 79 percent pure live seed 93 85 79 if the percent pls is divided into the cost of 1 pound of the seed and multiplied by 100 the cost per pound of pure live seed is determined this is a way to compare seeds that look similar in analysis but are dissimilar in price cost per pound 100 cost per pound of pls percent pls 250 100 316lb pls 79 three sample analyses follow study them and determine which mixture would probably cost the most and which the least mixtures versus singlespecies blends grass seed is commonly formulated as either a mixture or a blend a mixture combines two or more different species of grass a blend combines two or more cultivars of a single species both formulations have their place depending on the site and circumstances mixtures have been most common in temperate zone landscapes singlespecies plantings have been more common in subtropical and tropical landscapes mixtures sometimes have the disadvantage of variegated color and texture resulting from the different species they have the advantages of tolerating mixed environmental conditions and resisting devastation by diseases or insects that might wipe out a single species singlespecies turf plantings offer a more uniform appearance than mixtures but they are often victims of their own inability to adjust to varied environmental conditions on a site and to resist diseases and insects blends attempt to retain the advantages of both mixtures and singlespecies plantings if the cultivars are carefully selected the blend will offer uniform appearance plus environmental adaptability good resistance to wear compatible maintenance requirements of all component cultivars and resistance to pests of the area methods of installation depending on the species of grass the type of site and the immediacy of the need for a usable turf one of four methods is used to install a turfgrass planting 1 seeding 2 sodding 3 plugging 4 sprigging and stolonizing seeding seeding is the most common and least expensive method of establishing a lawn the seed may be applied either by hand or with a spreader on small sites if the site is extensive the seed may be applied with a cultipacker seeder a large seeder pulled by a tractor or by a hydroseeder a spraying device that applies seed water fertilizer and mulch simultaneously the hydroseeder is especially helpful for seeding sloped uneven areas figure 134 sodding when a lawn is needed immediately sodding may be selected as the method of installation sod is established turf which is moved from one location to another a sod cutter is used to cut the sod into strips these are then lifted rolled up and placed onto pallets for transport to the site of the new lawn figures 135 and 136 at the new site it is unrolled onto the conditioned soil bed the effect is that of an instant lawn sodding is much more costly than seeding but the immediacy is important to some clients and necessary on certain sites such as steep slopes and terraces where seed might wash away plugging plugging is a common method of installing lawns in the southern sections of the united states certain grasses such as st augustinegrass and the zoysias are not usually reproduced from seed instead they are placed into a new or existing lawn as small sections of sod plugs because the growing season in the south is longer than elsewhere the plugs have time to develop into a full lawn plugging is a timeconsuming means of installing a lawn and that is its major limitation however plugging is necessary for many warmseason grasses that are poor seed producers on large sites some mechanization of the process is possible sprigging and stolonizing like plugging sprigging and stolonizing are vegetative methods of establishing a lawn also like plugging the methods are more common to southern grasses than northern species a sprig is a piece of grass shoot it may be a piece of stolon or rhizome or even one of the lateral shoots sprigs do not have soil attached and so are not like plugs or sod they are planted at intervals into prepared conditioned soil several bushels of sprigs are required to plant 1000 square feet if done by hand the process is slow and tedious for large sites mechanization can lessen the time required stolonizing is a form of sprigging the sprigs are broadcast over the site covered slightly with soil then rolled or disked since each sprig is not individually inserted into the soil this method is faster,turfgrass plays a vital role in landscaping serving aesthetic and functional purposes across various environments from private residences to athletic fields and public parks its growth habits determine its characteristics rhizomatous grasses produce underground shoots that spread allowing for rapid establishment of new plants stoloniferous grasses develop horizontal shoots along the soil surface creating new plants at intervals bunchtype grasses grow from axillary buds resulting in a denser growth pattern but requiring closer spacing for uniform coverage selection of the appropriate turfgrass involves understanding factors such as growth habit leaf texture and seed size as well as environmental tolerances turfgrasses are categorized into coolseason grasses optimal temperatures of 60 to 75f and warmseason grasses thriving at 80 to 95f which influences their viability in different climates installation methods include seeding economical and commonly used either by hand or mechanically sodding provides an immediate lawn by transplanting established turf plugging involves inserting small sod sections suitable for certain species spriggingstolonizing uses vegetative pieces to establish new grass understanding seed analysis labels including purity and germination rates is essential for selecting highquality grass seed
proper lawn construction certain turf installations are unique a golf green is a highly specialized use of turf that has no counterpart in landscaping a rocky steeply sloped highway embankment requires special techniques too this chapter will only deal with the installation of conventional lawn plantings such as those of the typical home or commercial business site more specialized references are available for nontypical turfs six steps should be followed to ensure a beginning lawn every chance for success 1 plant at the proper time of year 2 provide the proper drainage and grading 3 condition the soil properly 4 apply fresh vigorous seed sod plugs or sprigs 5 provide adequate moisture to promote rapid establishment of the lawn 6 mow the new lawn to its correct height time of planting warmseason grasses grow best when the temperature is from 80 to 95 f they are best planted in the late spring just before the summer season in this way they have the opportunity to become wellestablished before becoming dormant in the winter coolseason grasses germinate best when temperatures are from 60 to 75 f the best planting time for them is early fall or very early spring right before the cool seasons in which they flourish if coolseason grasses are planted too close to the intensely hot or cold days of summer and winter they will die or go dormant before becoming wellestablished grading and draining the new lawn each time the rain falls or an irrigation system is turned on water moves across the surface of the soil as well as into it grading altering level land so that it slopes slightly can direct the movement of the surface water proper drainage permits the water to move slowly into the soil to the turfs root system where it can be absorbed yet pass beyond the root zone before it collects and does harm to the plants even lawns that seem flat must slope enough so that water moves off the surface and away from nearby buildings if a slight slope does not exist naturally it may be necessary to construct one a decline of between six inches and one foot per 100 feet is required for flat land to drain properly failure to grade lawns away from buildings can result in flooded cellars and basements drainage is critical to the survival of the lawn no matter what the species depending on the soil and site involved good drainage may require nothing more than mixing organic matter with the existing soil in cases in which the soil is heavy with clay a system of drainage tile may be necessary if drainage tile is needed it should be installed after the lawns grade has been established but before the surface soil has been conditioned regular fourinch agricultural tile is normally used placed 18 to 24 inches beneath the surface in a typical tile installation the tile lines are spaced approximately 15 feet apart each of the lateral lines runs into a larger main drainage line usually six to eight inches in diameter this in turn empties into a nearby ditch or storm sewer figures 137 and 138 conditioning soil suitable texture and proper ph are very important in soil that is to become a lawn most turfgrasses grow best in a loam or sandy loam soil with a ph that is neutral to slightly acidic 70 to 65 for a review of soil texture and ph refer to chapter 3 the additives needed to improve the texture drainage or ph of the soil can be incorporated best with a rototiller or larger agricultural field equipment figure 139 the tiller also loosens the soil surface and breaks it into smaller particles the tiller may do two additional things chop up weeds growing on the site and bring rocks to the surface both can be bad for the new lawn the stones mar the even texture of the lawn and if large enough can damage mowers and other maintenance equipment they should be removed with a rake hand or powered before seeding the weeds can cause future problems for the lawn especially if they are noxious or other perennial types it is best to eliminate them before installing the grass a nonselective systemic herbicide or shortterm soil sterilant can be applied both are expensive widely used and available under several brand names once the soil has been properly conditioned it is ready to plant planting the lawn seed seed is applied to the prepared soil in a manner that will distribute the recommended quantity evenly otherwise a patchy lawn develops when applied with a spreader or cultipacker seeder the seed is often mixed with a carrier material such as sand or topsoil to ensure even spreading the seed or seedcarrier mix is divided into two equal amounts one part is sown across the lawn in one direction the other half is then sown across the lawn in a direction perpendicular to the first figure 1310 placing a light mulch of weedfree straw over the seed helps to retain moisture it also helps to prevent the seed from washing away during watering or rainfall on a slope that has not been hydroseeded it is wise to apply erosion netting over the mulched seed to further reduce the danger of the seed washing away figure 1311 sod sod must be installed as soon after it has been cut as possible otherwise the live respiring grass will damage itself due to the excessive temperatures that build up within the rolled or folded strips of sod permitting the sod to dry out while awaiting installation can also damage the grass and result in a weak and unsatisfactory lawn the soil should be moist before beginning installation of the sod the individual strips are then laid into place much as a jigsaw puzzle is assembled the sod should not be stretched to fit as it will only shrink back later leaving gaps in the surface instead each strip should be fitted carefully and tightly against the adjacent strips using a flat tamper or roller tamp the sod gently to ensure that all parts are touching the soil evenly plugs plugs are small squares rectangles or circles of sod cut about two inches thick their installation is similar to that of groundcovers they are set into the conditioned soil at regular intervals 12 to 18 inches and in staggered rows to maximize coverage the top of each plug should be level with the surface of the conditioned soil the soil should be moist but not wet at the time of installation to prevent some of the plugs from drying out while others are still being installed sprigs sprigs are planted two to three inches deep in rows 8 to 12 inches apart in hand installations rows are not drawn instead the sprigs are distributed as evenly as possible over the prepared soil surface and pushed down into the soil with a stick as described earlier stolonizing uses a topdressing of soil over the sprigs and eliminates the requirement for individual insertion the soil should be moist but not overly wet when planting begins if the lawn area is large planted areas should be mulched and lightly rolled as the installation progresses to wait until the entire installation has been completed could result in drying out of the sprigs watering in each of the planting techniques above mulch is applied immediately after planting to prevent drying of the propagative material once the planting and mulching are completed water needs to be carefully applied the soil and developing grasses should not be allowed to dry out until the new grass is about two inches tall nevertheless the watering cannot be so heavy or continuous that the seedlings or new sprouts drown the soil erodes or diseases gain a foothold at least a month of watering several times each day is necessary to establish the new lawn properly sprinklers are preferable to a garden hose with a sprinkler the water can be applied slowly and evenly if the lawn has been planted for a client and the landscaper or turf specialist cannot be at the site to do the watering the client must be given explicit instructions about how and when to apply the water allowance for naturally occurring rainfall should be included in the written instructions client responsibilities such as watering should be written into any contract drawn between a professional firm and a consumer the first mowing the first mowing of a new lawn is an important one the objective is to encourage horizontal branching of the new grass plants as quickly as possible this creates a thick dense lawn the first mowing should occur when the new grass has reached a height of two and onehalf to three inches and the grass should be cut back to a height of one and onequarter to one and onehalf inches thereafter different species require differing mowing heights for proper maintenance table 131 for the first mowing it is a good practice to collect and remove the grass clippings after that clipping removal is usually unnecessary unless the grass has grown so tall between mowings that clumps of grass are visible on the lawn note that grasses used for soil stabilization will not require mowing calibrating a spreader two types of spreaders are used to apply seed fertilizer or other granular material to lawns these are the rotary spreader and the drop spreader the rotary type dispenses the material from a closed hamper onto a rotating plate that then propels it outward in a semicircular pattern the drop spreader dispenses the material through holes in the bottom of the hamper as it is pushed across the lawn in both types the amount of material applied is controlled by the size of the holes through which the material passes and the speed at which the spreader is pushed therefore use of a spreader requires that it be calibrated to dispense the material at the rate desired for materials that are applied often and by the same person the spreader need only be calibrated once and the setting noted on the control for future reference different materials usually require different calibrations even when the rate of application is the same the object of calibration is to measure the amount of material applied to an area of 100 square feet a paved area such as a driveway or parking lot is an excellent calibration site afterwards the seed or other material can be swept up easily for future use covering the area with plastic is also helpful in collecting the material after calibration windy days are not suitable for calibrating to calibrate fill the spreader with exactly five pounds of material select a spreader setting near the center of the range to begin apply the material by walking at a normal pace in a straight line shut off the spreader while turning it around each strip should slightly overlap the previous one to avoid a streaked appearance the probability of streaking is greater with a drop spreader than with a rotary spreader when an area of 100 square feet has been covered once weigh the material left in the spreader and subtract it from the original five pounds the quantity of material applied per 100 square feet has then been determined if it is not the distribution desired the spreader can be adjusted to increase or reduce the rate of application,proper lawn construction creating a successful lawn involves key steps tailored for conventional landscapes like homes and businesses to ensure a thriving lawn follow these six essential steps timing warmseason grasses thrive at 80 to 95f and should be planted in late spring coolseason grasses flourish at 60 to 75f making early fall or spring the best planting times grading and drainage proper grading directs surface water away from buildings and allows infiltration preventing flooding a slope of six inches to one foot per 100 feet is ideal for effective drainage soil conditioning the soil should be loamy or sandy loam with a ph of 65 to 70 use a rototiller to mix organic matter improve texture and remove rocks and weeds planting techniques seeds sod plugs or sprigs should be distributed evenly use a spreader for seeds and apply mulch to retain moisture sod should be laid quickly to avoid damage watering newly planted lawns need consistent moisture without waterlogging requiring several light waterings daily for the first month first mowing mow when the grass reaches 25 to 3 inches cutting it back to 125 to 15 inches to encourage density
maintaining an established lawn lawn maintenance requires a great deal of time during the growing season how the lawn appears is determined by the amount of time and money budgeted by the property owner or manager increasing public expectations of turf quality account for the great success of professional lawn maintenance firms nationwide spring operations a lawn needs both weekly and seasonal care in regions of the country where winters are long and severe spring may find lawns covered with compacted leaves litter and partially decomposed organic material termed thatch the receding winter may leave grass damaged by salt disease or heaving small areas can be cleaned of debris with a strongtoothed rake larger lawns may require the use of power sweepers or thatch removers where heaving has lifted large areas of sod away from direct contact with the soil a light rolling with a lawn roller is advisable in the spring the lawn should be rolled first in one direction then again in a direction perpendicular to the first clay soils should not be rolled since air can easily be driven from such a soil and the surface compacted no soil should be rolled while wet the roller can be used properly only after the soil has dried and regained its firmness the first cutting of the lawn each spring removes more grass than cuttings that follow later in the summer the initial cutting to a height of one and onequarter to one and onehalf inches has the same objective as the first cutting of a newly planted lawn that is to promote horizon tal growth of the grass an additional benefit of the short first cutting is that fertilizer grass seed and herbicide can then reach the soils surface more easily cuttings later in the year are usually not as short patching the lawn if patches of turf have been killed by diseases insects dog urine or other causes it may be necessary to reseed them or add new sod plugs or sprigs widespread thinness of the grass does not indicate a need for patching but a lack of fertilization or improper mowing patching is warranted where bare spots are at least one foot in diameter seed sod plugs or sprigs should be selected to match the grasses of the established lawn plugs can be set directly into the soil using a bulb planter or golf green cup cutter to cut the plug and then to remove the soil where it is to be planted with seed sod and sprigs it is best to break the lawn surface first with a toothed rake a reseeding mixture of a pound of seed in a bushel of topsoil is handy for patching where seed is the form of propagation mulch and moisture must then be applied as stated earlier the timetable for patching is the same as for planting and is related to the type of grass involved aerating the lawn aeration of a lawn is the addition of air to the soil air is an important component of the soil and is essential to good plant growth if the lawn is installed properly the incorporation of coarse sand and organic matter into the soil promotes proper aeration however where traffic is heavy or the clay content is high the soil may become compacted the turf specialist can relieve the compaction by use of a powered aerator figure 1312 there are several types of aerators and a range of sizes all cut into the soil to a depth of about three inches and either remove plugs of soil or slice it into thin furrows a topdressing of organic material is then applied to the lawn and a rotary power mower run over the organic material to blow it into the holes or slits left by the aerator the plugs of soil left on top of the lawn may be removed by raking or if not too compacted broken apart and left as topdressing mechanical equipment is made that can aerate and cover the topdressing in a single operation vertical mowing vertical mowing is a technique that can break up the soil plugs left by an aerator or even remove excessive thatch if necessary it requires a power rake or a mower whose blades strike the turf vertically it is done when the lawn is growing most rapidly and conditions for continued growth are favorable for coolseason grasses late summer or early autumn is the best time for warmseason grasses late spring to early summer is best the blades of the vertical mower are adjusted to different heights depending on the objectives of the operation a shallow setting is used to break up soil plugs a lower setting gives deeper penetration into the thatch layer facilitating its removal and relieving compaction of the soil deep vertical mowing is only practiced on deeprooted turfs shallowrooted turfs often growing mainly in the thatch layer are harmed more than helped by vertical mowing fertilization lawns should be fertilized just before they need the nutrients for their best growth for example coolseason grasses derive little benefit from fertilizer applied at the beginning of the hot summer months only the weeds benefit from fertilizers that are not timed to coincide with the turfs needs coolseason grasses should be fertilized in the early spring and early fall this supplies proper nutrition prior to the seasons of most active growth late fall fertilization encourages soft lush growth which is damaged severely during the winter warmseason grasses should receive their heaviest fertilization in late spring their season of greatest growth is the summer a look at table 131 reveals that not all species of grass require the same amounts of fertilizer as fertilizer costs increase and certain fertilizers become less available turf managers try to maintain plantings with minimal applications increasingly fertilizers with nitrogen in slowly available forms such as ureaformaldehyde sulfurcoated urea or isobutylidine diurea are being selected by turf management professionals still the specific amounts needed can vary greatly among species the most successful mixed species lawns are those that combine species whose fertilization requirements are compatible such as fescues and bluegrasses the amount of fertilizer required is usually stated in pounds of nitrogen per 1000 square feet per year the number of pounds of nitrogen in a fertilizer is determined by multiplying the weight of the fertilizer by the percentage of nitrogen it contains the examples that follow illustrate to obtain the fullest benefit from fertilizer it should be applied in an amount the turfgrass can use fully before it reaches beyond the root zone lawn fertilizer is usually applied in two stages half of the recommended poundage for the year can be applied to coolseason grasses in the early spring and the remaining half in the early fall warmseason grasses can receive half or more of the recommended fertilizer poundage during the late spring and the remainder in midsummer a spreader must be used to ensure even distribution of the fertilizer it is applied in two directions with the rows slightly overlapping watering turfgrasses are among the first plants to suffer from lack of water since they are naturally shallow rooted as compared to trees and shrubs the groundskeeper should encourage deep root growth by watering so that moisture penetrates the soil to a depth of 8 to 12 inches failure to apply enough water will promote shallow root systems that can be easily injured during hot dry summer weather figure 1313 infrequent deep watering is much preferable to daily shallow watering the quantity of water applied during an irrigation will depend on the time of day and the type of soil clay soils allow slower water infiltration than coarser textured sandy soils but clay soils retain water longer therefore less water may need to be applied to clay soils or the rate of application may need to be slower or both the amount of water given off by a portable sprinkler can be calibrated once and a notation made for future reference to calibrate a portable sprinkler figures 1314 and 1315 set several widetopped flatbottomed cans with straight sides such as coffee cans in a straight line out from the sprinkler when most of them contain the amount of water needed to penetrate 8 to 12 inches shut off the sprinkler and note the time required start by applying one and onehalf to two inches of actual water and check its depth of penetration then adjust accordingly permanent and computercontrolled automatic irrigation systems are common in large turf installations they turn on and off by timers and dispense a predetermined amount of water through valves that pop up for use and disappear out of sight afterward such systems are sophisticated and costly figure 1316 the best time of day to water lawns is early morning watering later in the day is inefficient due to greater evaporation watering in the early evening or later should be avoided because of the danger of disease turf pathogens thrive in lawns that remain wet into the evening the lawn should have time to dry before the sun sets,maintaining an established lawn maintaining a healthy lawn demands time and effort particularly during the growing season the lawns appearance is directly linked to the owners investment in care leading to increased reliance on professional lawn services spring operations in spring lawns often require cleanup from winter debris and thatch small areas can be raked while larger lawns may need power sweepers lightly rolling sod can help restore areas affected by heaving but avoid rolling wet or clay soils the first mowing should be at a height of 125 to 15 inches to promote horizontal growth and allow nutrients to penetrate patching is necessary for bare spots caused by disease or pests using compatible grass seed or sod aeration and vertical mowing aeration improves soil aeration by alleviating compaction which can be achieved using powered aerators vertical mowing helps remove excess thatch and is best done during peak growth periods fertilization fertilize coolseason grasses in early spring and fall warmseason grasses benefit from late spring fertilization watering water to a depth of 8 to 12 inches prioritizing deep watering over shallow methods early morning is the ideal time to water reducing evaporation and disease risks
mowing three types of mowers are used to maintain turf plantings the reel mower the rotary mower and the flail mower the flail mower is used for utility and stabilization turfgrasses that are only cut a few times each year reel and rotary mowers are used to maintain home recreational and commercial lawns on a reel mower the blades rotate in the same direction as the wheels and cut the grass by pushing it against a nonrotating bedknife at the rear base of the mower figures 1317 and 1318 the blades of a rotary mower move like a ceiling fan parallel to the surface of the lawn cutting the grass off as they revolve figure 1319 reel mowers are most often used for grasses that do best with a shorter cut such as bentgrass rotary mowers do not cut as evenly or sharply but are satisfactory for lawn grasses that accept a higher cut such as ryegrass bluegrass and fescue the riding mower so popular in suburbia is a rotary mower many campuses parks and golf course fairways are mown with a large bank of reel mowers called a gang mower pulled behind a tractor that has been fitted with tires that will not rut the lawn recently pullbehind wide area rotary mowers have found acceptance as a means to cut a swath up to 22 feet in width per pass a configuration of three mower decks linked side by side and connected to the power takeoff unit of the towing tractor can mow from 50 to 75 acres of open turf in an eight hour day while mower basics have seen little change through the years the technology and the techniques have been updated recently lawn care professionals can select mowers based on the mower deck width machine weights horsepower or styles that include walkbehinds riding or even sulky styles that permit the operator to stand and ride behind the mower as though water skiing in every situation the blades must be sharp to give a satisfactory cut dull or chipped mower blades can result in torn ragged grass blades that will die and give the lawn an unhealthy gray or brown pallor the sharp blades of any lawn mower should be respected when powered they can cut through nearly any shoe workers should never mow unless wearing steeltoed work shoes hands should never be brought near the blades while the mower is running no inconvenience caused by shutting off a mower can equal the instant injury that a power mower can do to a workers hand or foot table 131 on page 346 illustrates the often wide range of tolerable mowing heights that exists between and within species within the range the mowing height selected often depends on how much care the lawn can be given and what surface quality is expected the shorter height will necessitate more frequent mowing more watering during dry periods and perhaps greater pest control efforts in turn the lawn will respond with greater density and a finer texture due to thinner blades a taller lawn surface will have a slightly coarser texture even with grasses classified as fineleaf forms take longer to thicken but need cutting less often it will also withstand heat and dry periods better since the extra blade length will cast cooling shadows over the soils surface often fewer weeds are an added benefit of a taller lawn surface since not all species are mowed to the same height mixed species lawns should be made up of grasses that have similar cutting requirements the frequency of mowing is another variable in turfgrass maintenance because the rate of growth of a lawn can vary with the temperature and with the moisture provided the frequency of mowing cannot always be precisely specified where an inflexible mowing schedule is followed the turf planting will be unsatisfactory nevertheless professional firms must submit bids for lawn maintenance and so must have a reasonably accurate idea of how many times during the growing season a lawn will require mowing estate gardeners and golf course superintendents have less of a problem they can mow when the time is right not when a contract calls for it a longstanding and accepted rule of thumb is that mowing should remove about onethird the length of the grass blade thus if the turf is being kept at one and onehalf inches it should be mowed when it reaches a height of two and onequarter inches if the grass is permitted to get too long before cutting the dead clippings can mar the appearance of the lawn then the only alternative is to collect the clippings either in a grasscatcher or with a lawn sweeper or rake if cut properly the clippings will not be excessive will decompose rapidly and will not require collection the pattern of mowing should be varied regularly to prevent wheel lines from developing in the lawn and to encourage the horizontal growth of the shoots the easiest variation is to mow at a 90 angle to the previous mowing if a lawn is mowed in both directions on the same day with a reel mower an attractive checkerboard pattern develops the pattern is not so apparent with a rotary mower but the practice is just as healthful for the lawn overseeding not to be confused with patching overseeding is the planting of new seed into an established turf area to extend its time of use usually the grass being applied is different from the established species the practice of overseeding has been common on southern golf courses for many years as the autumn and winter seasons begin the warm season grasses go dormant and turn brown the application of a rapidly germinating cool season grass that thrives in the reduced temperatures brings back the green that golfers want to see another common use of overseeding is on athletic fields where the established turf such as kentucky bluegrass wears away before the season ends so overseeding with a rapidly germinating perennial ryegrass can bring back the lush green appearance in only a few weeks it is usually done in conjunction with aeration since it is important to get the seeds in contact with the soil overseeding is enjoying increasing popularity as a maintenance technique for commercial landscapes its appeal to homeowners is less dramatic but increasing nonetheless weed control in established lawns turfgrass plantings can be marred by the presence of weeds the weeds may include undesirable grasses and broadleaf plants they may be annuals biennials or perennials many are prolific seed producers and infiltrate the lawn each year often invading from the lawn of a neighbor who is not conscientious about control other weeds are indicators that something is wrong with the lawn for example certain weeds are predictable where the soil is too compacted for healthy grass growth others are found where winter pavement salt has killed off the turf for a review of weeds and herbicides see chapter 6 preemergence herbicides are used to control many weeds in lawns and must be applied several weeks in advance of the weeds germination to be effective the time of application will vary depending on the region of the country and the weeds involved preemergence herbicides are the preferred means of controlling annual grass weeds postemergence herbicides are used against weeds that have already germinated and are visible in the lawn they are usually applied to the lawn rather than to the soil they may be formulated as either contact or systemic herbicides depending on the product postemergence herbicides are most often used against perennial grasses and broadleaf weeds selectivity is an important characteristic of turf herbicides so that the desirable grasses are not damaged by the control effort annual grasses and broadleaf weeds are commonly controlled with selective herbicides however perennial grass weeds require the use of a nonselective herbicide one that kills all vegetation that it touches nonselective herbicides must be applied on days without wind and with applicators that control the amount and direction of flow very carefully after the treated area is free of weeds and time has rendered the herbicide harmless new patch planting can take place for products recommended against specific turf weeds turf managers can consult their local college of agriculture or cooperative extension service because turf weed problems and recommended controls do not vary greatly from state to state helpful information can also be found in trade journals that serve the turf industry pest control weeds are only one of the pests that affect turf installations like all plants turfgrasses are susceptible to an assortment of pathogen insect animal and human injuries table 132 is a partial list of the problems that can befall a typical lawn with turf as with any crop the best defense against most pests is the selection of resistant varieties and the creation of a growth environment that favors the turfgrass more than the pest for example watering at night promotes fungal growth of all types and invites disease watering should be done earlier in the day to allow the grass to dry before nightfall another example allowing a thick thatch layer to develop provides a good habitat for certain insects minimizing the thatch layer reduces these insect populations when soil insects are reduced or eliminated the turf is not as attractive to rodents such as moles that burrow through the soil to feed on them therefore solving one problem may indirectly solve another pest control in turf is not easy or inexpensive nor can it be approached casually however the arsenal of fungicides insecticides and rodenticides in combination with attentive ipm scouting and increased knowledge of pest vulnerabilities are adequate to the task of preventing or eradicating most lawn pests for a review of the principles of pest control see chapter 6 the local college of agriculture can provide specific recommendations for the control of people their vehicles and their pets the groundskeeper must rely on fencing shrub masses and walls to direct their movement onto paved areas signs requesting cooperation in the preservation of an attractive turf will often help by making people more aware of problems they may cause after all not everyone knows the difference between soil aeration and compaction vandalism is impossible to control if the vandals are determined turf is not as attractive a target as other components of the landscape but it gets its share of abuse golf courses and parks are most often damaged by vehicles rutting the turf but the problem is also found on campuses and even in some residential neighborhoods locked gates and strategic placement of trees can sometimes help by making vehicular access to the turf difficult for the wouldbe vandal education to increase public awareness of the value of the landscape and the responsibilities of citizens is the only real solution to vandalism it is also easier to write in a textbook than it is to bring into being,mowing overseeding and weed control in lawns maintaining healthy turf requires understanding the various mowing techniques and tools including reel rotary and flail mowers reel mowers cut grass by pushing it against a bedknife making them ideal for shortcut grasses like bentgrass rotary mowers operate like ceiling fans cutting taller grasses such as ryegrass and bluegrass riding mowers are popular for residential use while gang mowers are often used in larger areas like parks and golf courses proper mowing involves keeping blades sharp to avoid damaging grass and maintaining recommended heights which can affect lawn health overseeding is distinct from patching and involves introducing new seeds into established turf to enhance its longevity commonly practiced on golf courses during seasonal changes weed control is crucial for lawn health utilizing preemergence herbicides to prevent annual weeds and postemergence options for existing weeds selective herbicides target specific weeds without harming desired grass species while nonselective options eliminate all vegetation and require careful application pest management in lawns focuses on preventing disease and insect infestations by fostering healthy grass growth integrated pest management ipm techniques including the use of fungicides and insecticides are essential for maintaining a robust lawn ecosystem
techniques of plant propagation science and craft among all the crafts of ornamental horticulture none exemplifies the application of science to the profession better than plant propagation it is a craft that changes continually in response to new research findings yet it respects the skills and techniques that only time practice and caring can convey this is a howto chapter it outlines the methods of reproducing plants that are practiced in various ornamental horticulture professions you should review chapter 5 as preparation propagation techniques are practiced by all types of ornamentalists homeowners are able to establish new plants from seeds and cuttings taken from the plants of friends nursery and greenhouse owners can increase their inventories by various propagation techniques some firms become so specialized that they engage solely in plant propagation providing rooted cuttings bulbs or high quality seed to growers nationwide the media for propagation to promote the initiation and development of new roots on cuttings it is necessary to create an environment for the cutting base that will support the cutting retain moisture uniformly drain away excess water uniformly provide adequate aeration not support weed seeds and other pests pasteurize easily if seeds are the propagative unit the medium must also be a source of nutrition for the developing embryo the propagating medium will usually contain one or more of the following materials natural soil sand peat moss sphagnum moss perlite vermiculite fired clay natural soil is not commonly used for propagation unless mixed with quantities of coarser additives such as fired clay sand or perlite to improve its drainage and aeration if pure sand is used for propagation it must not be too fine or drainage will be poor the best sand to use is quartz sand fairly coarse in texture all the materials used as propagation media should be steam pasteurized before use to eliminate weed seeds nematodes fungi and other soilborne plant pathogens the time required for establishment of new plants will vary from a week to several months with seed propagation it will be necessary to transplant the newly rooted plants from the propagating medium to a medium that will provide the nutrients necessary for sustained growth for nursery crops the new plants may be set directly into the field greenhouse growers may choose to install the plants directly into greenhouse benches or into containers ranging in size from bushel baskets to small clay or peat pots field soils and greenhouse bench soils must be of loamy texture and well drained both may require the addition of sand or peat moss for texture moisture retention and drainage one of the soilless mixes may also be used tables 141 and 142 list the components of the older university of california and newer cornell mixes that enjoy wide acceptance throughout the ornamental horticulture industry the structures for propagation the structures that serve as production facilities for greenhouse and nursery growers also serve for propagation greenhouses hotbeds cold frames and lath houses see chapter 19 can all be used directly or in some modified manner to propagate plants the propagation structure must possess the following four characteristics 1 sufficient light or darkness to permit seed germination and photosynthesis 2 high humidity to reduce wilting of the cutting until new roots can form and to promote callus tissue formation in grafts 3 warmth to accelerate germination or rooting 4 ventilation once roots have been formed to reduce the risk of disease since plant propagation usually requires higher temperature and greater humidity than general crop culture the grower may designate certain structures for propagation only where the quantity of plants propagated does not justify an entire greenhouse or frame one or two benches may be used as propagation chambers with a timed mist line to provide the moisture and a covering of transparent polyethylene film draped on wires over the bench to retain the humidity an excellent propagation bench can be created figure 141 the plastic canopy can be folded back at night permitting the cuttings to surfacedry thus reducing the risk of mildew and other diseases in such a situation it is critical that the media used and the benches assigned for propagation be pasteurized and welldrained propagation by seeds propagation by seeds is practical if the seed is able to produce plants with predictable and desirable features seeds are produced and collected by industry specialists who market them through catalogues that illustrate the mature plant to potential buyers seed suppliers usually provide the buyer with information about the best time to plant any pretreatment that may be necessary and followup culture information a grower who propagates from seeds should select a reputable supplier who will provide seed that is true to species and free of pests weed seeds and inert material it should also have a high germination percentage as determined by a seed test preconditioning of seeds certain species of plants particularly those likely to be grown in a nursery may produce seeds that require preconditioning before germination as explained in chapter 5 some seeds possess seed coats that are so hard and impervious to water that they must be altered before water can be absorbed and germination initiated in their natural habitat such seeds may require exposure to weathering elements or passage through the digestive tract of animals to break down the seed coat a commercial grower can overcome such seed coat dormancy by mechanical scarification of the seed several techniques are commonly used including abrasion such as rubbing with sandpaper or tumbling in drums with coarse sand or gravel soaking the seed in hot water and allowing it to cool over a twelve to twentyfourhour period soaking the seed in concentrated sulfuric acid until the seed coat is paper thin but the embryo is not yet affected this may require from several minutes to hours depending on the species other species of plants produce seeds that remain dormant until certain physiological changes termed after ripening are initiated and completed within the seed the initiation of the changes is usually temperaturerelated beginning when the temperature drops below 50 f for a required period of time the chilling is termed stratification and it can be duplicated by growers when the needs of a particular species are known to stratify seeds they are first soaked in water for a half day or longer then mixed with sphagnum moss or another moistureretaining medium sealed in polyethylene bags for oxygen permeability and stored in a cooler not a freezer for the required period of time if the moistureretaining medium is not sphagnum moss which has a natural fungicidal quality then a seed fungicide should be added for protection some seeds may possess double dormancy and require both scarification and stratification before they germinate a great amount of research continues to be directed to the use of growth regulators as substitutes for the afterripening period most of the results have yet to prove of commercial value although gibberellic acid and kinetin are of some use to commercial growers,techniques of plant propagation plant propagation is a crucial aspect of ornamental horticulture integrating science and craft to reproduce plants this practice evolves with research while preserving timehonored techniques various propagation methods cater to different professionals from homeowners propagating plants through seeds and cuttings to specialized nurseries focused solely on plant propagation media for propagation successful propagation requires a medium that supports cuttings retains moisture provides aeration and drains excess water common propagation materials include natural soil sand peat moss and perlite often pasteurized to eliminate pathogens the establishment time for new plants can range from one week to several months necessitating careful transplantation into nutrientrich mediums structures for propagation propagation structures such as greenhouses and cold frames should provide adequate light high humidity warmth and ventilation specific benches can be designed for propagation equipped with misting systems and plastic coverings to maintain humidity while allowing for surface drying at night propagation by seeds seed propagation requires seeds with desirable traits preconditioning techniques such as mechanical scarification and stratification may be necessary for germination these processes prepare seeds with hard coats or dormant seeds ensuring successful growth ongoing research into growth regulators aims to enhance propagation efficiency
planting the seeds the successful propagation of new plants from seeds depends on careful attention to all of the production factors should any one factor be limiting the survival or quality of the plants can be affected the factors of good production are good quality seed correct propagation medium correct planting techniques appropriate lighting proper watering good drainage proper temperature adequate nutrients the attributes of highquality seed and the features of good propagation media have been discussed planting techniques for seeds vary depending on whether the species are herbaceous or woody and whether they are to be transplanted after germination or will be grown at the planting site procedure for planting seeds of herbaceous greenhouse crops 1 fill greenhouse flats with a propagating medium that has been pasteurized and is wellaerated welldrained and fertile 2 tamp and firm the medium to drive out air pockets leave about onehalf inch of space at the top of the flat to allow for watering 3 plant the seeds in furrows or in holes made with a pegged board tiny seeds may be broadcast over the surface the seeds may be covered with additional propagating medium shaking the medium through a wide screen sieve will ensure that the seeds are covered evenly 4 if the seeds are large enough so that they will not be washed away the flats can be watered from above figure 142 for fine seeds the flats should be immersed in water before seeding the planted seeds should be kept moist for rapid germination yet not so moist that dampingoff disease becomes established moisture may be applied by handwatering or by use of a mist system moisture loss can be reduced by covering the flat with glass or transparent plastic for a portion of the day care must be taken to ensure that the seedlings do not remain too wet at night 5 a germination temperature of 70 to 75 f is suitable for most greenhouse plants tropical plants may require higher temperatures plants should not be allowed to overheat 6 after germination reduce the temperature to between 65 and 70 f and maintain moderate light intensities a soil drench to guard against dampingoff disease is advisable a slight reduction of water to a point that the new roots are moist while the surface is moderately dry will also aid in control of dampingoff 7 after two to four true leaves not the seed leaves cotyledons have formed transplant the seedlings to allow healthy growth to continue if conditions at the transplant site are more stressful than at the germination site as when seedlings are moved from greenhouse to field conditions a hardeningoff period is needed hardeningoff occurs when reduced temperature and water cause carbohydrates to accumulate in the plant tissue allowing it to survive transplant shock the hardeningoff process is described in more detail later in this chapter procedure for planting seeds of woody crops for container production 1 following any preconditioning that may be necessary the seeds can be planted as in the previous procedure the time required for germination may be considerably longer with woody crop seeds 2 when the seedling roots have reached the bottom of the greenhouse flat they should be pruned to promote branching the attributes of highquality seed and the features of good propagation media have been discussed planting techniques for seeds

following any preconditioning that may be necessary the seeds can be planted as in the previous procedure the time required for germination may be considerably longer with woody crop seeds 2 when the seedling roots have reached the bottom of the greenhouse flat they should be pruned to promote branching 5 a mulch should be applied to shade the new seeding and aid water retention the mulch also reduces the force of water on the new seeds and helps maintain their spacing lightweight organic mulches work best but additional nitrogen should be applied to compensate for that tied up by microbes during the decomposition of the mulching 7 the new seeding if in a nursery seedbed should be shaded whether in a seedbed or unshaded nursery row it should be kept moist temperature extremes and drastic changes should be avoided 8 the plants may remain in the seedbed or nursery row for a season or more before being transplanted propagation by plugs plugs are seedlings that retain their undisturbed root system within a core of media they are planted as seeds into shallow chambered flats known as plug sheets figure 143 which vary depending on the size of the plug being produced typical plug sizes range from 716 34 34 deep to 1316 114 78 deep on 21 11 plug sheets that contain from 98 to 800 chambers per sheet the plug chambers may be either square or round resulting in a root plug of the same shape while plugs are used in many areas of horticulture in the production of ornamentals they are most widely used by the growers of bedding plants a majority of growers prefer to use plugs over other seed propagation techniques for several reasons transplant shock common to bareroot seedlings and transplanting time are reduced plugs do not overcrowd as quickly as seedlings in germination flats so they can be held longer awaiting transplant sowing of the seed can be automated and there is no need to thin the seedlings after germination resulting in the need for fewer seeds and in time saved plugs can be transplanted automatically further reducing time and labor costs shorter crop production time permits more crops to be produced in the same facility although some growers do start their own plugs the trend is toward specialization in plug production by large wholesale growers who can provide the controlled environments necessary to produce highquality plugs at reasonable costs they then sell the plugs to other growers for transplanting and further growth planting the seeds as a result of the specialization in plug production the large plug propagators sow the seed automatically unless a particular species has a seed type that does not work in automatic seeders after the plug sheets are filled with the proper pasteurized propagating medium each chamber is seeded with one or two seeds the use of two seeds per chamber ensures maximum and uniform production per sheet but it does add some labor costs if thinning is later needed germination of the seeds in the plug chambers can be done conventionally in the greenhouse benches under misting systems or in growth chambers if particular species require special humidity andor temperature conditions whether in the bench or growth chamber water application must be even and gentle to avoid washing out the seeds automated mist systems are preferable to handwatering even with fogger nozzles due to the shallowness of the plug sheets there is always the danger of overwatering or underwatering the sheets cannot become watersoaked neither can they be permitted to dry out the problem of stretching if kept too long in a growth chamber after germination the plugs will stretch and overgrow likewise when the seeds in a plug sheet do not germinate uniformly the early ones will stretch while the grower awaits the germination of the slower seeds michigan state university researchers have published convincing evidence that in many plants especially bedding plants stretching can be reduced by keeping the greenhouse temperatures cool during the day and warm at night a day temperature cooler by 5 f during production of plugs can result in a higher number of plug sheets displaying nearmaximum germination without undesirable overgrowth chemical growth retardants also have proved effective against plug stretching the retardants are somewhat speciesspecific though and should not be used until the grower is certain no damage will result to the plugs being produced fertilizing plugs after water nutrients rank as the most probable limiting factor in plug production fertilization is vital since the small core of propagation medium in each chamber is unable to offer much to the new plant major and minor elements are both critical low nitrogen fertilizer about 50 ppm can be applied at the time of seeding with concentrations increasing as the seeds germinate and begin to develop local problems such as high soluble salt levels or ph extremes outside the optimum 58 to 60 need to be addressed as well,successful seed propagation is essential for cultivating healthy plants and involves several critical factors highquality seeds are fundamental as they ensure robust growth the propagation medium must be pasteurized wellaerated and nutrientrich to support seed germination techniques for planting vary between herbaceous and woody crops for herbaceous plants seeds should be sown in greenhouse flats filled with the appropriate medium with moisture carefully managed to prevent dampingoff disease a fungal infection that can devastate seedlings optimal germination occurs at temperatures between 70 to 75f key procedures include firming the medium in flats while allowing space for watering using appropriate watering techniques based on seed size larger seeds can be watered from above while finer seeds require immersion transplanting seedlings after they develop two to four true leaves with a hardeningoff period essential for seedlings moving to more stressful environments propagation by plugs involves sowing seeds into shallow chambers minimizing transplant shock and labor costs effective nutrient management is crucial as the limited volume of medium provides minimal nutrients
propagation by cuttings cuttings are pieces of roots leaves or stems that are removed from the parent plant and placed in an environment that promotes their development into total plants in most cases the new plant will be genetically identical to the parent plant since propagation by cuttings is an asexual method of reproduction as measured by sheer numbers of plants produced propagation by cuttings is the most widely used method of reproducing ornamental plants asexually the reasons are that the technique is quick easy and inexpensive greenhouse growers and nursery growers both propagate important commercial crops from cuttings propagation by cuttings is possible because of the ability of plant cells to revert to an undifferentiated actively growing meristematic condition from which they can once again initiate the root stem and or leaf tissue necessary to form a complete plant years of research have been directed toward understanding why and how cuttings develop into complete plants and why certain species are easier to propagate than others although not everything is known or understood these points are commonly accepted adventitious roots are initiated in herbaceous plants from points just outside or between the vascular bundles in woody plants they originate next to and out from the center of the vascular core the adventitious root initials growing points may develop after cuttings are taken or they may be preformed but dormant in the vegetative tissue before the cutting is taken individual species vary adventitious roots and adventitious shoots do not develop at the same rate within an individual plant or among different species the rate of root and shoot initiation and formation in cuttings is controlled in part by growth regulators principally auxins gibberellins and cytokinins some growth regulators occur naturally in the tissue others can be applied by the propagator those that occur naturally may promote or inhibit growth depending on the growth regulator and plant species involved and the concentration of the growth regulator auxin is necessary for the initiation of adventitious roots on stem cuttings iaa indole3acetic acid is the naturally occurring auxin naa naphthaleneacetic acid and iba indolebutyric acid are similar materials but synthetic the synthetic auxins applied by plant propagators are generally more effective than the naturally occurring iaa at initiating the formation of new roots on stem cuttings the formation of adventitious roots is very slow in certain plants depending on the species rooting may be inhibited by 1 naturally occurring rooting inhibitors in the plant tissue 2 the lack of one or more rooting cofactors found by several researchers to work synergistically with auxin in root initiation or 3 a continuous sclerenchyma ring between the phloem and the cortex that creates a physical barrier to developing roots as they attempt to emerge from the center of the vascular core cuttings possess polarity they form new shoots at the end nearest the tip of the plant the distal end and new roots at the end nearest the crown the proximal end in commercial propagation operations care must be taken to orient the cuttings properly in the propagation bench to prevent delayed and unsatisfactory rooting the best cuttings result from healthy stock plants that contain adequate nitrogen for good shoot formation and high carbohydrate levels for easier rooting excessive nitrogen in the cuttings is likely to inhibit root formation lateral shoots make better cuttings than terminal shoots in certain species because the former contain more carbohydrates whereas the latter are very high in nitrogen adventitious roots form more quickly on stem cuttings in the dark than in the light stock plants of certain species can have their stems which are to be used as cuttings wrapped in black plastic or tape where the roots are to form later when the cuttings are made new roots will form more quickly in the darkened portion this is one reason why airlayering works as a propagative technique and why cuttings root best at their proximal end within the darkened rooting medium stem or root cuttings taken from young plants root more quickly than cuttings taken from older plants the juvenility factor is commonly acknowledged but only partially understood many commercial propagators maintain their stock plants in hedge form to sustain the juvenile growth phase rather than permitting the plants to develop into their normal adult tree form cuttings from lateral shoots and others from vertical shoots may develop into plants with different growth habits generally strongly vertical plant forms will result only if the cuttings are from vertical shoots the more easily a species roots the less important is the position of the cutting on the stock shoot cuttings can usually be taken from the stock plant regardless of whether it is in a flowering or vegetative stage when a species is difficult to root better results are usually obtained when vegetative growth is selected for the cuttings research suggests that a reduction in auxin levels during flowering is a probable reason the environment for rooting once separated from the stock plant cuttings are vulnerable to injury from assorted environmental factors to ensure the rooting of the greatest number of cuttings several precautions must be taken by the propagator moisture moisture is critical to the successful rooting of the cutting the irony of the situation is that the leaves need to produce food to support root formation but lack of roots prevents the cutting from taking up water the leaves need for photosynthesis to produce food the more slowly a species forms roots the more critical the situation becomes to reduce water loss from transpiration a mist line is widely used by propagators seldom applied continuously intermittent mist under the control of a time clock maintains high humidity around the leaves of the cuttings the film of water that settles onto the leaves also keeps the cuttings cooler than the drier air temperature temperature controls the rate of root and shoot development in cuttings if the air temperature in the propagation bench is too high shoots will form faster than roots placing even greater moisture stress on the cutting instead the rooting medium should be warmer than the air to promote root growth in advance of shoot development to accomplish this an electric heating cable and a thermostat may be installed in the propagation bench with controlled daytime air temperatures between 70 and 80 f night temperatures of 60 f and the rooting medium slightly warmer at all times the cuttings should root satisfactorily nutrition nutrition supplied during rooting may influence the quality of the cuttings produced since the rooting medium is not high in nutrients and the misting leaches minerals from the plant tissue it is often beneficial to add a liquid fertilizer to the mist water acidityalkalinity the ph of the rooting medium can affect the number and quality of adventitious roots produced media having a ph near neutral have generally been found to produce the best root systems there are selected exceptions however for example azaleas root better in an acidic medium light quality and intensity as noted previously high carbohydrate levels in cuttings promote good root formation therefore high light intensity from sunlight or an artificial source high in red andor blue wavelengths most usable by plants is necessary for good root development as the cuttings develop the day length may begin to affect the shoots either positively or negatively research has shown the effect of photoperiod to vary depending on the species of plant being propagated the season of the year and the type of cutting oxygen content as long as the propagating medium is porous and the bench well drained sufficient oxygen will usually enter the medium to satisfy the plants needs if the cuttings are found to be producing adventitious roots only near the surface of the medium it is an indication that the medium or bench is not draining well types of cuttings and methods of propagating them in table 143 various types of cuttings are compared many species of plants can be propagated by more than one technique which method is most practical is a decision to be made by the commercial propagator figure 144 hardeningoff the cuttings hardeningoff means the gradual adaptation of plants to environmental conditions more stressful than their present ones cuttings rooted under conditions of high light high humidity and warm temperatures must be hardenedoff soon after the roots form if normal growth is to occur allowing the cuttings to remain in the propagation environment longer than necessary for rooting can cause damage to both new roots and new shoots however the abrupt cessation of misting or other special propagating conditions can result in severe shock to the cutting commercial propagators use various techniques to hardenoff cuttings among these techniques are the following either reduce the misting interval or gradually decrease the misting the time of system operation root cuttings in peat pots for direct transplanting or directly into their sales container this eliminates any chance of root disturbance the reduced metabolic rate transplant during the dormant season of the cuttings reduces transplant shock this allows roots hold transplants temporarily under high humidity to adjust to the new medium with no disturbance to the foliage the remove the propagating frame from around the cuttings cuttings can then send roots into soil beneath the rooting medium and continue their growth undisturbed,propagation by cuttings is a widelyused efficient technique to reproduce plants asexually producing offspring genetically identical to the parent plant this method involves taking sections from stems roots or leaves of a parent plant and placing them in a controlled environment where they can develop into independent plants this process is possible because plant cells can revert to an undifferentiated state enabling the formation of new roots stems or leaves auxins like iaa indole3acetic acid and synthetic options such as naa and iba play a significant role in root formation especially in stem cuttings cuttings possess polarity meaning they develop roots at the proximal end and shoots at the distal end making orientation crucial in propagation the success of propagation also depends on environmental factors such as moisture temperature and light for example misting reduces water loss and cooling stress while controlled temperatures promote balanced root and shoot development after roots form cuttings are gradually hardenedoff to prepare them for harsher conditions proper techniques ensure high success rates and healthy stock plants with optimal nitrogen and carbohydrate levels yield the best results
propagation by grafting a plant graft is the union of parts from two or more plants into a single plant the technique of grafting requires a knowledge of which plants can be grafted which ones benefit from grafting and how to do the numerous types of grafts knowledge of how to graft plants has existed for centuries knowledge of why only certain plants can be grafted and why they grow as they do is more recent and is still incomplete much of the research into grafting has been accomplished with citrus and other fruit trees because of the commercial importance of those grafted plants ornamental propagators graft either when the resulting plant is superior to those provided through other methods of propagation or when no other propagative method will work other ornamental horticulturists such as groundskeepers turn to grafting to repair brace or otherwise save damaged plants occasionally grafting is used to create special and unusual plant forms such as treeform shrubs or weepingform trees while grafting can be done on both woody and herbaceous plants it is most common to woody plants a typical plant graft involves the following parts figure 145 the portion of the graft that will develop into the root system stock of the new plant the portion of the graft that will develop into the branches scion and foliage of the new plant it may constitute some or all of the canopy depending on how much of the top growth of the stock was removed the scion may be a small branch or a bud it should not be a sucker or water sprout the point where stock and scion join it usually remains graft union visible throughout the plants life a piece of plant stem placed between the stock and scion interstock resulting in two graft unions it is not a part of every grafted plant it is used to join two species that will each unite with the interstock species but not with each other it may also contribute additional characteristics to the new plant how the graft forms while methods are varied the goal of the propagator is always to place the separate cambiums of the stock and scion into close contact in order that the two may fuse the joining of the separate parts is made possible by the production of callus or wound tissue from the parenchyma cells of the cambiums of both stock and scion the cells of the callus tissue intermingle until a binding results cell differentiation follows and parenchyma cells become cambium cells the new cambium a product of the two previously separated plant parts produces new vascular tissue the formation of a vascular connection between the stock and scion is essential for the success of the graft when the graft union is successful and the two different plants become one it is termed a compatible graft if the two plants do not unite even though there was no error in the technique used it is termed an incompatible graft in some instances the graft may appear successful until months or years later when the plant suddenly dies or snaps off unexpectedly at the graft union delayed incompatibility is the term used to describe such a situation the uses and limitations of grafting as noted earlier propagation research is ongoing the uses of grafting will no doubt increase as more is learned about the reasons for its current limitations some of the widely accepted information about grafting can be summarized as follows grafting can increase the winter hardiness of certain plants by providing them with a root system that is more tolerant of low temperatures replacing the root system with that of a more resistant species can permit the growth of plants normally susceptible to soilborne pathogens trees girdled by animals lawn mowers or vandals can often be saved by bridgegrafting a pistillate dioecious plant can have a scion from a staminate counterpart grafted to one of its branches to ensure the pollination needed for fruiting multiple cultivars can be grown on one established tree assuming all are compatible with it thus it is possible to have rose bushes with several differentcolored blooms on one plant apple trees that bear four or five different kinds of apples and the same with citrus fruits some hybrid plants grow more vigorously if removed from their own root system as seedlings and grafted onto another rootstock the rootstock can greatly influence the subsequent growth of the scion after graft union the effect may be one of dwarfing or acceleration altered growth habit increased or reduced flowering and fruiting pest resistance or hardiness not all plants graft and unite as easily as others it is not a problem of incompatibility but of species variation also some species graft more successfully by one technique than by another not all plants can be grafted generally the closer the botanical relationship between the plants involved the greater the probability of a successful graft for example grafting among members of the same clone is predictably successful among different species of the same genus some will graft and some will not among different genera grafting is highly improbable the materials needed for grafting the tools and accessory materials required for grafting have changed little during the hundreds of years that the craft has been practiced todays materials have the benefit of being produced and sold commercially so it is unnecessary for propagators to make their own even so many still choose to do so regardless of how the materials are obtained grafting requires the following basic items a knife the knife must be well constructed of good steel that can be sharpened repeatedly and retain a good edge fixedblade knives are preferable to folding knives because they have greater strength especially important with woody material budding described later requires a modified knife styled for the more detailed and intricate needs of the techniques note severely cut fingers are common even among experienced propagators finger guards for the thumb and index finger are recommended especially for beginners tying materials some grafts require tying the tying material must have strength with elasticity so that it will not girdle the plant as the graft union forms and expands materials range from ordinary string to commercially manufactured plastic or rubber tapes all must either rot away or be removed soon after the graft union forms grafting wax wax serves as a sealant to keep moisture inside the graft region and to keep insects and inoculum out figure 146 the wax must be water repellent or it will be washed away it must be elastic enough to permit expansion as the graft union grows in addition it must not melt in warm temperatures both hot and cold waxes are available from commercial sources if hot wax is used a source of heat is required to melt the wax a brush is used to apply the wax ensuring the success of a graft assuming that the stock and scion have the potential for a compatible graft union the propagator can maximize the percentage of successful unions by taking several precautions obtain scions from the current seasons growth when it is matured not succulent avoid terminal shoots central to basal shoots are better select scion and stock material from plants that are free of pathogens and abnormalities use herbaceous materials immediately after collecting to prevent their drying out woody material may be collected at the time of grafting or prior to it if collected and stored until use the cut material should be kept moist but not surface wet and cool 40 to 50 f peat moss shavings or similar noncohesive materials are suitable for storing scions place the cambiums of the stock and scion in the closest contact possible this will ensure the strongest and most rapid graft union wrapping the stock and scion can assist a close contact after the graft is assembled keep it moist coating the grafted area with wax will usually suffice placing the grafted plant into a covered frame or moistened holding medium will also provide the proper environment around the grafted area pinch off any shoots that develop from the stock types of graft methods of grafting vary with the size of the plants some methods are more effective than others with herbaceous materials still other methods were developed to accommodate specific plants figure 147 shows and describes the most common types of grafts used by ornamental horticulturists it is not allinclusive a more detailed treatment can be found in texts devoted solely to plant propagation,grafting is a technique that joins parts of two or more plants to grow as a single plant this method widely used in horticulture allows a scion part that becomes the branches and foliage to fuse with the stock part that forms the root system to create plants with unique properties its commonly used in woody plants especially fruit trees for advantages such as enhanced disease resistance hardiness and unique growth forms successful grafting depends on close contact between the cambiums growth layers of the stock and scion where wound tissue or callus forms enabling a vascular connection essential for nutrient and water flow several grafting benefits include enhancing plant survival in cold climates saving damaged plants by bridge grafting combining multiple cultivars on one plant for variety increasing resistance to pests and soil pathogens grafting requires skill including knowledge of compatible species tools like grafting knives and materials such as tying tapes and wax to secure the graft ensuring the grafts success involves maintaining moisture keeping scions fresh and removing any unwanted shoots from the stock with proper technique grafting offers a valuable way to cultivate and preserve desired plant characteristics
propagation by budding budding is actually a type of grafting but the techniques are sufficiently specialized to warrant separate consideration the rootstock is similar to that used in other grafting methods that is seedlings rooted cuttings and branches of young trees and shrubs the scion is markedly different though it is only a single bud with a patch of bark and sometimes a bit of wood attached budding is comparatively simple as a grafting method it is the most rapid method of propagating roses for commercial sale fruit trees and other nursery stock are also propagated and topworked through budding top working is the grafting of scions onto the existing framework and root system of a large established tree it is done to produce a crop faster than natural growth permits since one budstick can provide as many scions as it has buds budding is often a means of maximizing limited propagative materials budding involves removing a piece of bark on the stock plant and replacing it with a comparably sized piece from a compatible plant the added piece contains a bud which develops into a new shoot afterward the stock above the newly grafted shoot is cut back along with any buds that develop on the stock below the graft successful union requires that the bark of both the stock and scion separate easily termed slipping for removal the bark slips most readily when the plant is actively growing budding can be done almost any time from spring through the fall as long as the bark is slipping and buds not shoots are available from the scion plants fall and spring are the best seasons for budding but attention must be given to the state of development of the buds in the fall buds may be used after they have formed prior to the onset of winter normally they will remain dormant through the winter and begin growing in the spring for spring budding the budstick often must be collected early in the winter while still dormant then kept in moist cool storage until the bark begins to slip on the stock plant outdoors summer budding most often done in june requires that the leaves on the scion be sufficiently mature to have formed an axillary bud that can be used when a leaf is attached to the bud the blade should be cut away allowing the petiole to remain the petiole provides a handle to lift the bud patch it will later die and drop away tools for budding the grafting knife described previously can be purchased with a pointed blunt end useful in inserting the bud piece other tools have been devised to make the budding technique faster and easier these include an assortment of doublebladed knives for patch budding that permit simultaneous parallel cuts on opposite sides of the bud to be made in a single stroke the bark patch removed from the stock plant will be of a similar size to the bud patch figure 148 the result is a tighter fit and more rapid healing methods of budding there are several different methods of budding some require actual removal of bark from the stock others require only an incision into the bark permitting the bud to be slipped in behind it following are some of the methods tbudding the most widely used method of budding tbudding derives its name from the shape of the incision made in the bark of the stock plant figure 149 it is most adaptable to young thinbarked nursery stock up to an inch in diameter it is the major propagation technique used in the commercial production of roses the bud is cut from a slipping budstick as a shieldshaped piece the cut should be shallow just beneath the bark avoiding the wood as much as possible the bud shield should be cut from an inch above the bud to half an inch below it using the thumb a gentle sideward push separates the bud shield from the wood the stock is prepared with a oneinch long vertical cut through the bark on a smooth internodal section of stem a horizontal cut across the top completes the tincision the blunted end of the budding knife lifts the stocks bark and the bud shield is inserted when the upper edge of the bud shield matches the top of the tincision the bark flaps are closed around but not over the bud then the bud graft is tied usually with a rubber budding strip the strip ensures a tight fit of stock and scion and prevents drying after several weeks the rubber strips will decompose and fall away waxing is not necessary in some parts of the country the tincision is reversed to keep out rain that could promote rotting of the bud this is termed inverted tbudding patchbudding using rootstocks and budsticks that are nearly the same size about an inch in diameter a rectangular patch of bark is removed from both the stock and the scion figure 1410 the scion patch contains the bud that will be the shoot of the new plant the special tools described earlier help to keep both patches the same size the most appropriate use of patch budding is with a stock plant that has thick bark and a scion plant whose budsticks have thin bark with heavy bark a tbud graft does not fit tightly enough the closer the fit is the better are the chances of a successful graft union following insertion of the scion patch into the stock plant the union is wrapped leaving the bud uncovered ibudding this method is a combination of the techniques thus far described the scion is prepared by cutting a patch from the budstick figure 1411 the stock does not have a patch of bark removed instead an ishaped cut is made into the bark the two horizontal cuts and one vertical cut create two flaps of bark these can be lifted up and the bud patch slipped beneath following insertion of the bud patch and after ensuring that stock and scion meet the graft should be tied chip budding when either the season of the year or environmental conditions result in a nonslipping bark condition it is still possible to propagate some plants by budding chip budding unites a chip of wood containing a bud from the scion with a stock plant that has had a comparably sized chip removed from an internodal area near the base figure 1412 the technique works best with small wood up to an inch in diameter the chips are removed with two downward cuts that intersect with the scion one cut begins onehalf inch above the bud and proceeds downward and inward to a point about onequarter inch beneath the bud the other cut is beneath the bud downward and angled sharply inward to intersect the longer cut from above the cut into the stock is made the same way as with all bud grafting the closer the two chips are in size the better the chance of rapid healing of the union followup regardless of which budding technique is used the followup procedures are the same if budded in the fall the shoots of the stock may be retained until the following spring then they are cut off above the graft union as soon as the buds begin to break dormancy if budded in the spring the stock can be cut back as soon as the graft union is established in ten to fourteen days summer budding usually results in dormant scion buds that do not break until the following spring even though the union has been established they can be treated in the same manner as fallbudded plants propagation by layering certain species of plants do not develop roots rapidly enough to be propagated by cuttings in these cases the stem dies from lack of water and nutrients before the roots can be initiated layering permits the stem to remain partially attached receiving water and nutrients through the still intact vascular system while initiating roots at the point where separation from the parent plant will eventually occur compared to other methods of propagation layering is usually slower more expensive and produces fewer new plants per parent plant for reproduction of large numbers of the most common nursery and greenhouse crops layering has limited use amateur horticulturists use the techniques frequently when quantity is not important specialty nurseries use layering for unusual or rare species that do not reproduce from cuttings landscape gardeners whose professional efforts are directed to a single landscape such as an estate cemetery or school campus also use layering techniques successful layering depends on treatments applied to the stem to create an accumulation of carbohydrates auxins and other organic materials in the layered region the treatments commonly applied to the stem include elimination of light in the region where rooting is desired intentional injury or girdling where rooting is desired application of growth substances to promote rooting provision of a rooting medium that is wellaerated moist and of a consistent and moderate temperature methods of layering simple layering a dormant oneyearold branch is bent to the ground and covered with soil except for its tip which is left exposed to the light a short distance back from the tip the branch is bent sharply upward this bend may be accompanied by a cut on the underside of the branch figure 1413 it is at the bend or cut that rooting will occur the exposed section of branch is usually staked for support following rooting the new plants can be severed from the parent plant tip layering a shoot from the current season of growth is bent to the ground and covered with soil if layered by hand a hole can be made for the tip to rest in which is angled downward on the side closest to the parent plant and vertical on the other side sometime later the shoot will turn around and begin growing upward out of the soil the layered tip will eventually form a new plant complete with roots and terminal shoot figure 1414 it can be separated just prior to transplanting many species of plants propagate naturally by tip layering and propagators promote the technique by pinching back the tips of plants to encourage additional shoots to form mound layering the parent plant is cut back to ground level while dormant encouraging a proliferation of new shoots in the spring as the shoots grow soil is added periodically to keep each shoot covered to onehalf its height figure 1415 within the mound each shoot will develop roots each rooted shoot can then be cut off at the base and grown as a new plant the parent plant can be used repeatedly to produce new plants air layering amateur horticulturists frequently use this technique on interior plants it results in the formation of roots on an aerial portion of the stem following a slit or girdling injury figure 1416 portions of stem used should be a year or less in age the injury should be made 8 to 12 inches back from the tip of the branch if girdled a strip of bark onehalf to one inch wide should be removed with care taken to ensure complete removal of the phloem and cambium if slit the cut should be one to two inches in length slanted upward and toward the center following the injury the stem can be treated with a rootpromoting chemical usually in a talcum powder carrier a quantity of damp not wet sphagnum moss is wrapped around the injured area of the stem and fastened with polyethylene film then tied at each end a split jiffy pot makes a perfect medium for rooting when wrapped around the cut or girdled area moist sphagnum moss wrapped in a plastic cover will also work,propagation by budding and layering budding is a specialized grafting technique where a single bud from a donor scion plant is grafted onto a rootstock this is commonly used to propagate roses fruit trees and nursery plants key budding methods include tbudding patchbudding ibudding and chip budding in tbudding a tshaped incision is made in the rootstock bark into which the bud is inserted patchbudding is suited for thickerbarked plants by removing a matching bark section from both scion and rootstock ibudding involves creating an i shaped incision and chip budding is used when the bark doesnt slip easily budding is usually done in spring or fall for ideal bud dormancy layering allows a stem to form roots while still attached to the parent plant receiving nutrients to aid rooting simple layering involves bending a branch into the soil while tip layering buries the tip of a young shoot mound layering encourages new shoots by covering the base of the plant with soil air layering creates roots on aerial parts by girdling the stem then wrapping it in damp moss layering is useful for species that dont propagate well from cuttings
propagation by tissue and organ culturing most propagative techniques whether natural or developed by horticulturists have been recognized and practiced for centuries the twentieth century however heralded the beginnings of new techniques presently termed tissue culturing and organ culturing these techniques permit the reproduction of certain species from tiny pieces of plant organs such as embryos pollen grains and shoot tips or from undifferentiated plant tissue usually callus the piece of organ or tissue is removed from the parent plant under sterile conditions using precision scalpels forceps and tweezers figures 1418a 1418b and 1418c immediately after removal it is transferred to a sterile nutrient material in either a liquid or gelatinous agar state usually contained in a clear glass flask tube or petri dish totally sterile aseptic conditions are essential throughout the process to prevent contamination of the culture by microorganisms such as fungi and bacteria while methods to ensure aseptic conditions vary the following precautions are typical the transfer chamber is kept free of all contamination whether the chamber is a special room used solely for the purpose or a small boxlike compartment it must be rid of all dust spores bacteria and other contaminants figure 1419 sterilization of small chambers may be accomplished with ultraviolet light caution ultraviolet light can be blinding and should not be looked at directly larger chambers may be washed down with chlorine bleach or ethyl alcohol all tools containers and solutions are kept sterile they can be made that way initially by subjecting them to high temperatures under pressure in an autoclave figure 1420 during the culturing operation tools and the openings of containers can be kept sterile by passage through the flame of an alcohol lamp or bunsen burner all plant tissue is surface sterilized before use care being taken not to damage the plant tissue disinfectants commonly used include merthiolate mercuric chloride calcium hypochlorite and sodium hypochlorite disinfectants include hot water steam and formaldehyde the nutrient media used for organ and tissue culturing vary with the species of plant being propagated agar media are the most common but liquid media can also be used as long as a filterpaper wick is placed in the tube to hold the tissue or organ piece out of the solution the media usually contain inorganic mineral elements both macro and micronutrients sucrose sugar growth regulators and vitamins assorted other additives are found in the several media developed by researchers you may wish to consult texts on plant propagation for the formulations of knops solution the murashigi and skoog medium whites medium or knudson c medium the media take their names from the scientists who first developed or reported them following a successful transfer from parent plant to the aseptic and nutritious environment of the tube flask or petri dish the piece of plant tissue termed an explant enters a period of growth new tissues and organs are differentiated and a new complete plant is formed not all explants are able to differentiate they continue to produce callus tissue rendering the culture useless the failure of certain species to differentiate is probably due to our failure to provide the right conditions rather than to any biological limitation however the full differentiation from callus or organ explant to complete plant may require several aseptic transfers of the developing plant each time altering the size of the growth container and the composition of the nutrient medium current applications due in part to its complexity and cost and in part to its difficulty when compared to other methods of plant propagation tissue culturing still finds its greatest application as a technique for plant breeding genetic research and pathological research however since the 1970s commercial tissue culture has grown in both the number of species propagated and the total number of new plants produced annually commercial production methods seldom begin with single cells instead using the tips of shoots and roots as well as tiny pieces of leaves roots and stems sometimes lateral buds are used developed through basic research and later adapted to commercial methods of tissue and organ culturing many ornamental plants have found their way to the marketplace as cultivars with improved vigor new colors new resistance to disease greater tolerance to stress longer bloom periods and assorted other improvements orchids daylilies anthuriums philodendrons chrysanthemums carnations geraniums gladiola gloxinias roses and rhododendrons have all been improved in one way or another since the mid1970s using the micropropagation techniques of tissue and organ culture once it was possible to make micropropagation economically profitable a new commercial industry was born as of this writing the major uses of commercial tissue culture are especially those developed mass propagation of specific clones by breeders and geneticists who want to rush new plants into the marketplace perpetuation of parent stock plants that produce desired hybrid seeds maintaining diseasefree germ plasm keeping plants in year round production by bypassing their natural seasonal cycles by cloning embryos in mass and coating creation of artificial seeds them with a protective biodegradable shell containing nutrients pesticides and fertilizer it permits the new plant to be handled like a regular seed but with all of the desired traits ensured through selective micropropagation plant propagation exemplifies the application of science to the craft of ornamental horticulture it is a craft that changes continually as new facts are discovered yet respects the skills and techniques that have evolved over many years of practice the medium for propagation must provide support moisture retention drainage aeration a pestfree environment and sometimes nutrition it may be made up of one or more of the following soil sand peat moss sphagnum moss perlite vermiculite or fired clay it must be pasteurized before use propagation can occur in greenhouses hotbeds cold frames or lathhouses the environment must provide proper light high humidity warmth and ventilation seed propagation may require a light or dark environment for germination depending on the species it may also require scarification or stratification if the seed possesses one or more types of dormancy planting techniques for seeds vary depending on whether the species are herbaceous or woody and whether they are to be transplanted after germination or will be grown at the planting site propagation by cuttings is the most widely used method of asexual plant reproduction it is quick easy and inexpensive it is made possible by the cells ability to revert to an undifferentiated condition once again initiating the root stem and leaf tissues necessary to form a complete plant there are different types of cuttings and different methods of propagating them some capable of producing greater quantities than others soon after rooting occurs the cuttings must be hardenedoff to adapt them to more stressful growing conditions the technique of grafting necessitates a knowledge of which plants can be grafted which ones benefit from grafting and how to make the numerous types of grafts grafting is usually done either because the plant benefits from it or because no other propagative method will work grafting is possible on both herbaceous and woody plants but is most common on woody plants the tools needed for grafting are a knife finger guards tying materials grafting wax and a source of heat methods of grafting vary with the type of plant woody or herbaceous its size and sometimes the species budding is a method of grafting that requires somewhat specialized techniques it involves the removal of a piece of bark on the stock plant and its replacement with a comparably sized piece containing a bud from the scion there are several different methods of budding layering as a propagative technique permits the stem of a new plant to remain at least partially attached to the parent plant while new roots are initiated there are different methods of layering simple layering top layering mound layering and serpentine layering find frequent use by professionals air layering enjoys popularity with amateurs tissue and organ culturing are comparatively recent propagative techniques they permit the reproduction of certain species from tiny pieces of plant organs such as embryos pollen grains and shoot tips or from undifferentiated plant tissue usually callus the propagative material is collected under aseptic conditions and transferred to sterile nutrient media usually contained in flasks tubes or petri dishes the piece of tissue then enters a period of growth and new tissues and organs are differentiated to form a complete new plant,propagation by tissue and organ culturing tissue and organ culturing developed in the 20th century enable the growth of plants from small pieces of plant organs or undifferentiated tissue callus under aseptic conditions this technique involves extracting plant parts such as embryos or shoot tips under sterile conditions and transferring them to nutrient media in glass containers like tubes or petri dishes these nutrient media often agarbased contain essential minerals sucrose growth regulators and vitamins maintaining sterility is crucial tools are sterilized using autoclaves or flames and plant tissue is disinfected with agents like sodium hypochlorite after culturing plant tissue termed an explant can grow and differentiate into a full plant however certain species might only produce callus tissue and not form a complete plant often due to suboptimal conditions rather than biological constraints tissue culturing has revolutionized plant propagation in areas such as plant breeding genetic research and the mass production of diseasefree plants micropropagation benefits commercial growers by enabling yearround production preserving desirable traits and producing artificial seeds notable applications include cultivating improved varieties of ornamental plants like orchids roses and chrysanthemums
the nursery industry the scope of the business americas plant nurseries and greenhouses are among the fastest growing segments of us agriculture according to the economic research service of the us department of agriculture the annual sale of horticulture products in the united states has held steady at approximately fortyfive billion dollars since the beginning of the current decade with floral and nursery crops accounting for over onethird of the sales or fifteen billion according to the american nursery and landscape association nursery and greenhouse crops are among the top ten agriculture crop commodities in 42 states and are in the top five commodities in 27 of the states the top five states for production of greenhouse and nursery crops as measured by cash receipts and reported by the usda economic research service are california 24 texas 11 florida 9 north carolina 9 oregon 7 an initial consideration of the nursery industry might predict that it is a fairly homogenous one varying little from one operation to the next or even from one state to the next however that is not the case the nurseries of america range in size from minibusinesses to multistate corporations the number of people employed is seasonal with an estimated 105000 working during the height of the season even the length of the season varies with some operations doing most of their work during a six month period and others enjoying a full twelve months of productivity when the landscape industry is added to the employment figures the total number of workers employed nationally is over 600000 there are believed to be about 25000 nursery and greenhouse operations nationally most of them are small businesses in fact sixtyfive percent of the total industry revenues are produced by only 2000 nursery and greenhouse firms by lumping the statistics for nurseries with those of greenhouse growers there is some blurring of the data if someone is interested only in knowing about production nurseries however many nurseries include greenhouses among their facilities so the combination of the two is logical trying to draw sharp distinctions between floral crop production and nursery crop production is easy if comparing cut flowers and potted holiday plants with woody trees and shrubs it is less clear when considering crops such as bedding plants or tropical foliage plants that may be grown indoors or out depending on the production location the scale of production and other crops being grown at the facility greenhouses are common to many different types of plant producing operations often including nurseries both types of operation deal with highvalue intensively cultivated crops in general nurseries deal largely with woody plants trees shrubs vines and groundcovers however as just noted they may also produce or at least handle large numbers of herbaceous plants as well a nursery production facility is likely to require more land than an operation that uses only greenhouses for production different types of nurseries the nursery industry is a complex one not easily categorized into distinctly different branches there are plant growers retail sellers and associated supply andor service businesses but they are not always separate operations each of the following type of business is part of the nursery industry propagation nursery wholesale nursery wholesale nursery supplier retail nursery privately owned garden center chain store garden center landscape nursery each function will be described separately but remember that countless nurseries throughout the country combine two or more functions as in any seasonal business diversity is often the way to keep the cash register ringing during the offseason with summer the peak period for nursery production and the sale of nursery plants occurring almost entirely in the spring and fall nurseries may rely on the sale of flowers christmas trees decorations birdhouses and endless other products to expand their profits some may combine the propagation of woody plants with their wholesale production and sale others may combine wholesale and retail operations propagation nurseries a propagation nursery initiates plant production propagation techniques are defined and described in chapter 14 nurseries that engage totally or partially in propagation may buy or collect seeds from all parts of the world these seeds are then germinated and grown to a size that allows the plants to be passed on to other nurseries a propagation nursery may also reproduce plants from cuttings or similar methods of vegetative propagation propagation nurseries are responsible for the introduction of new species and cultivars to the nursery industry as a whole they are also key sources of disease and pestfree stock material these nurseries depend on the sale of large quantities of plants since the perplant value of a young seedling or rooted cutting is very low a propagation nursery may specialize in only a few crops or grow a wide range of material wholesale nurseries and suppliers a wholesale nursery is one that grows plants to a salable size in the field or in containers what a salable size is cannot be defined precisely except to say that the plant is not at full maturity but is ready to install in the landscape figure 163 the wholesaler may propagate the seedlings or cuttings but large operations usually buy stock from a propagating nursery rooted cuttings ready for transplanting into containers or the field are called liners or lining out stock a plant may spend from one to five years or more in the wholesale nursery depending on its rate of growth and the sale size desired while in the nursery each plant is provided with space fertilizer weed control shearing shaping and pest control to bring it to market as soon as possible the longer it remains in the nursery the more it costs the grower a cost that is passed on to the buyer and eventually to the retail customer to hold down production costs many wholesale nurseries limit the number of different species they grow to those requiring similar production techniques in so doing the nurseries are able to maximize the use of expensive equipment while minimizing the number of different fertilizers chemical sprays and growing environments necessary to produce highquality plants unfortunately this economic good sense leads to a limited number of species available for use in landscapes wholesale nurseries sell their plants to other businesses that resell them at a higher price to the final consumer figure 164 since the customers of a wholesale nursery are widespread and distant perhaps as much as several states away it is critical that the nursery be near transportation routes nearby truck or rail lines keep down the costs of handling and shipping for the convenience of retail operators and landscapers who come directly to the wholesale nursery to pick up their plants it must be near a major highway system one type of nursery wholesaler may grow no plants the rewholesaler is a classic example of middleman operations they take advantage of situations in which there is a limited selection of plant species available to landscapers operating in areas having a few or only small wholesale growers to select from the rewholesalers purchase plants in quantity from growers across the country and make available to the local practitioners a wider selection of species and sizes than would otherwise be possible retail nurseries retail nurseries and garden centers are two major customers of the wholesale nursery they are also the final link in the marketing chain through the retail nurseries the privately owned garden centers and the garden centers operated by regional or national chain stores nursery products reach the consumer it is to these businesses that the homeowner comes when wishing to purchase trees and shrubs sprays fertilizers grass seed garden tools and similar items for the home property figures 165 and 166 retail nurseries and garden centers seldom have growing areas of any significance instead they have sales yards where the materials purchased from the wholesalers can be displayed and maintained figure 167 the method of display will vary with the place and with the type of material involved plants growing in pots or other containers may be set on an asphalt or crushed stone surface trees and shrubs sold in balledandburlapped root forms or as bareroot stock may require holding in deep bins of peat moss or sawdust to prevent their drying out some retail nurseries and garden centers also have a greenhouse from which they sell tropical houseplants and potted flowers like the outdoor salesyard the greenhouse is usually open for customer browsing and promotes sales by providing a realistic setting in which to display the plants figure 168 the location of the retail operation is important to its success it must be near developing residential areas and easily reached by car if located on a major thoroughfare it has a better chance of attracting customers from the passersby a remote location for a retail outlet increases the amount of money that must be spent on advertising in addition to supplying plants and other materials to retail customers the garden center or nursery is usually the local center for garden advice when should i plant what colors will the flowers be what kind of fertilizer does my lawn need how can i attract bluebirds to my backyard questions of this type besiege the retailer and present an opportunity to promote good customer relations some retail operators write garden columns for local newspapers others are frequent speakers at garden clubs and on radio and television programs successful retailers of nursery materials have a thorough understanding of ornamental plants their culture and care but equally important they have good communication skills and an interest in working with the general public it is primarily in the degree of customer service that privately owned garden centers and nurseries differ from those operated by chain stores the chain garden center may not be in operation for the entire year instead it may concentrate its sales effort on the two periods of heavy customer demand the spring and the fall the chain garden center may be staffed by personnel with limited horticultural knowledge since they spend most of their time in some other sales area such as hardware or clothing there is seldom much interpersonal contact between sales personnel and customers in a chain store operation still the quality of the merchandise may be as good as in a private garden center and often the prices are lower since the larger operation can take advantage of discount buying landscape nurseries the landscape nursery may grow plants buy them from a wholesale nursery or both in addition to providing a retail outlet for plants the landscape nursery provides an installation service for homeowners who do not wish to develop their landscapes themselves such a nursery must employ several types of workers retail salespeople landscape crews and often a separate crew for nursery production or sales yard stock maintenance,the us nursery industry generating around 45 billion annually is a flourishing segment of agriculture driven by nurseries and greenhouses producing a wide variety of plants california texas florida north carolina and oregon lead the nation accounting for most of this production seasonal employment is common with over 600000 workers employed at peak times in both nursery and landscape roles nurseries range from small familyowned businesses to expansive multistate corporations catering to diverse markets types of nurseries include propagation nurseries these start the lifecycle of plants nurturing seeds or cuttings until theyre ready for other nurseries they introduce new plant varieties ensuring theyre healthy and free of pests wholesale nurseries these grow plants to a mature salable size focusing on efficient largescale production they sell primarily to other businesses such as landscapers and garden centers retail nurseries often located near residential areas these nurseries sell directly to consumers offering plants tools and expert gardening advice landscape nurseries these provide both plants and installation services for homeowners seeking professionally designed landscapes each type of nursery is critical addressing different aspects of plant growth customer needs and seasonal sales
the production techniques of ornamental horticulture greenhouses and other growing structures the purpose of growing structures if the climate throughout the world were consistent with sunny temperate days and dry cool nights with sufficient rainfall to keep soil moist but not overly wet with no hailstorms or damaging winds and with day lengths always suitable to promote flowering then there would be no need for greenhouses or other growing structures the commercial production of highquality intensively cultivated plant material requires just such conditions therefore the purposes of a greenhouse reveal themselves 1 to provide a controlled growing environment for plants whose economic value justifies the expense 2 to permit the growth of plants in regions where survival outdoors is not possible 3 to extend the season of growth for plants at times when they would normally go dormant materials used to cover the structures as the description of the different types of growing structures indicates the materials used to cover glaze the structures are glass or some type of plastic while glass has the longest history as a glazing material plastics now dominate in the commercial industry they are available in both soft and rigid forms the choice of glazing material will directly affect plant growth because materials differ in the amount of light they let into the house and the amount of heat retained or lost also affected by the choice of glazing material is the cost of constructing the house initially the amount of maintenance required to keep the glazing in good condition and the frequency of replacement required glass the classic and traditional covering has one great advantage over the plastic alternatives the high level of light transmission that it permits it also has a longer life than the plastic coverings in regions of the country where heavy snow loads may collapse a plastic covered house the framework of a glass greenhouse allows it to stand strong against the weight and the wind while a few panes of glass may be lost the greenhouse will survive however it is not without its disadvantages vandals and hail storms can damage glass greenhouses more easily and at greater cost than plastic houses plastic is available in rolls or as rigid panels it may be applied to the framework of the greenhouse as a single layer or as double sheets separated by a layer of air to improve heat retention the initial reason for the popularity of plastic over glass was its lower cost that advantage has lessened with the unexpected sharp rise in the cost of petroleumbased products and narrowed the cost differential between glass and the plastics plastic glazings have the disadvantages of reduced light transmission especially during the gray days of winter and a tendency to sustain a higher humidity within the greenhouse that can lead to added disease problems table 191 compares the glazing materials used to cover greenhouses and other growing structures the most recent statistics from the agriculture statistics board indicate that glass is the glazing of choice for about 13 of the nations greenhouses rigid plastic panels cover about 19 and soft plastics are used for over 68 of the production structures typical structural plans figures 196 through 199 show typical construction details for the major types of growing structures previously described and illustrated figures 191 through 195 heating the greenhouse anyone who has spent even a moment in a greenhouse on a bright sunny day can attest to its ability to magnify the suns energy the ability to admit light and use the energy for warmth and plant growth is one side of the story the other side is the inability of the greenhouse to retain any significant portion of that heat energy after the sun sets any attempt to insulate the greenhouse in a conventional manner would severely reduce the admission of light that is critical to good plant growth therefore the need for supplemental heating is apparent with rising energy costs confronting every greenhouse professional the choice of heating systems deserves some thought where the opportunity for a choice exists nearly all systems are automated now and many involve both primary and backup emergency systems depending on the size of the greenhouse and to some extent the length and severity of the cold weather season the heating system may be either a localized system or a central system localized heating systems are contained solely within the single greenhouse or section of a greenhouse that they are intended to heat a central system is more like the heating system in a large building it has a boiler that produces heat to warm a number of separate greenhouses throughout the range localized heating systems there are different types of localized systems distinguished by the type of fuel they require most are unable to produce an amount of heat comparable to the central heating systems but that should not be expected of them unit heaters or forcedair heaters as they are also known produce their heat within a fuel box and a fan blows it into the greenhouse the heated air may be allowed to mix with the greenhouse air in the immediate vicinity of the heater figure 1910 or it may be forced into heating the greenhouse anyone who has spent even a moment in a greenhouse on a bright sunny day can attest to its ability to magnify the suns energy the ability to admit light and use the energy for warmth and plant growth is one side of the story the other side is the inability

it into the greenhouse the heated air may be allowed to mix with the greenhouse air in the immediate vicinity of the heater figure 1910 or it may be forced into a polyethylene tube that is connected to the heater and runs the length of the greenhouse the latter method allows a more even distribution of the heat throughout the greenhouse propane natural gas or kerosene are the usual fuels for unit heaters radiant heaters comprise a linear system that runs the length of the greenhouse and is especially suited for houses that are narrow and long the system uses a long tube covered by an aluminum reflector propane or natural gas is burned within the tube causing it to reach a temperature of approximately 900 f the hot gas is then pulled through the tube by a pump at the exhaust end of the system as it passes along the tube the heat of the gas causes the tube to emit infrared radiation and it does so at a 90degree angle to the surface of the plants benches and floor upon striking the flat surfaces the infrared radiation is converted to the desired heat central heating systems the most even distribution of heat throughout a greenhouse is accomplished when the heat is generated from a central system rather than from a localized system the boiler may be fueled with natural or propane gas oil or even wood or coal it produces either hot water or steam that carries the heat energy into the greenhouses through a series of pipes that give off the heat into the air of the greenhouse the placement of the pipes has a significant effect on the efficiency of the heat distribution so placement will vary depending on what is being grown and how the benches are designed and placed the pipes may be placed beneath the benches for crops grown in or on raised benches if the potted crops are grown directly on the floor of the greenhouse then the heat distribution pipes may be placed beneath the floor central heating systems that use hot water as the heat source can locate the distribution pipes around the perimeter of the greenhouse or overhead as well a steam system offers an additional advantage it provides steam for use in pasteurization of the soil used to support crop growth table 192 compares unit heaters with the two types of central heating systems,growing structures such as greenhouses create controlled environments essential for the successful cultivation of ornamental plants these structures ensure favorable conditions like regulated light temperature and humidity enabling plant growth yearround and in adverse climates greenhouses are covered with glass or plastic both with unique benefits and drawbacks glass provides high light transmission essential for plant health and durability in harsh weather but can be more costly and easily damaged by hail plastics available in flexible or rigid forms are cheaper though they transmit less light and may retain higher humidity potentially leading to disease heating systems maintain warmth crucial for plant growth especially in cold climates localized heating includes unit heaters and radiant heaters ideal for individual greenhouses unit heaters use forcedair systems fueled by gas or kerosene while radiant heaters distribute heat via infrared central heating systems typically found in larger setups use boilers to heat water or steam efficiently distributing warmth throughout interconnected greenhouses steam systems add the benefit of soil sterilization each system type considers fuel cost greenhouse size and climate conditions to maximize energy efficiency and support plant health
ventilating and cooling the greenhouse the even distribution of air throughout a greenhouse is essential for consistent temperatures and uniform plant growth also greenhouse air should move slightly as often as possible to minimize mildew and other diseases of plants that proliferate under stagnant air conditions ventilation of greenhouses is accomplished by using roof and side ventilators exhaust fans fan and convection tube systems a retractable roof use of roof and side vents for air exchange is based on the principle that heated air rises hot air exits through the roof vent while fresh cooler air enters through the side vents when ventilators run the length of the roof and sides air exchange is consistent throughout the house use of ventilators alone is the oldest method of ventilating greenhouses figure 1911 exhaust fans can be used in warm weather to draw old air out of the house and pull fresh air in fans can supplement roof and side ventilators or be used in place of them as in small plasticcovered quonset houses figure 1912 when the outside air is so cold that its direct entry into the greenhouse would cause plant injury a plastic convection tube can be used to permit warming and even distribution of the air before it enters the greenhouse atmosphere a polyethylene sleeve with holes the tube inflates and pulls outside air into the house when fan jets operate the convection tube system may be paired with exhaust fans as well as heaters or cooling systems to provide temperatureadjusted fresh air for the greenhouse figure 1913 cooling the greenhouse is necessary many times during the year and is vital if the greenhouse is to be used during the summer months three basic approaches are taken depending on the time of year and geographic location 1 shading the glass to reduce light intensity 2 ventilating to allow cooler outside air to replace warm air inside 3 promoting heat exchange through water evaporation shading greenhouse shading can be obtained by spraying a compound onto the glass externally it is a temporary shading that gradually washes away with the rain in the south a more permanent shading compound may be used the compounds are available in both liquid and powdered forms those containing binders persist longer figure 1914 shading can also be applied internally as cotton polyester or saran cloth sun screens suspended above a crop to reduce the light intensity figure 1915 the saran is available in different weaves that determine the amount of light reduction the screens can be automated to be pulled across the greenhouse in response to signals from photocells this gives the cloth sun screens an advantage over exterior shading sprays the sun screens only reduce the light intensity when it is needed sprayed shading reduces the light intensity all day long even on cloudy days when the reduced light is reduced even more perhaps to a detrimentally low level an additional advantage of some sun screens is that they can also be drawn over crops to retain heat during cold weather ventilation as described earlier greenhouse ventilation systems bring fresh air into the greenhouse to replace the warm internal air as long as the outside air is cooler than the temperature desired for the greenhouse ventilation will cool the greenhouse during especially hot weather just opening the vents may not be enough some greenhouses have been structurally modified to improve their ventilation and cooling capability while the modifications vary the structures are collectively termed retractable roof greenhouses they permit the roof of the production facility to be pulled back when desired thereby providing a more natural environment for growth of the plants when conditions are suitable when the outside weather is not good perhaps too cold too hot too wet too arid or even too bright the roof can be restored and the desired environment recreated within the closed greenhouse heat exchange and water evaporation when water evaporates or changes from a liquid to a vapor it absorbs heat from the atmosphere and cooler air results that is the principle behind two greenhouse cooling systems fan and pad and fog evaporative fan and pad cooling uses exhaust fans and continuously wet pads of excelsior a fibrous porous material crossfluted cellulose aluminum fibers or glass fibers through a recirculating water system the pads are kept wet at one end of the greenhouse while fans at the opposite end of the house pull outside air through the pads into the greenhouse the system goes by other names as well wetpad cooling or washed air cooling regardless of name the principle is the same figures 1916a and 1916b fog evaporative cooling uses a highpressure pump to create a fine mist the water droplets are so tiny that they remain in suspension in the air then evaporate as the fog disperses through the greenhouse the evaporation of the tiny droplets causes the desired cooling without getting the plants wet both fan and pad cooling and fog evaporative cooling systems can reduce greenhouse temperatures from 10 to 30 f below the outside air conserving energy in greenhouses as the era of cheap fuel passes into history a new era of energy conservation has begun greenhouse growers have felt the impact of increased fuel costs directly in their cost of production since most greenhouse crops are discretionary rather than essential consumer purchases the cost of production cannot be allowed to parallel the cost of fuel or sales may decline the greenhouse industry has responded in several ways to the need for energy conservation to curb rising production costs current trends in crop production show an orientation of crop types to geographic regions crops needing high temperatures for optimum production are being grown less commonly in the northern states and in greater numbers in the south cooltemperature crops such as carnations are replacing warmtemperature crops such as roses in northern greenhouses it must be noted however that the technology for energy conservation in greenhouses is still in its infancy no doubt some of the techniques to be described will prove their merit and gain acceptance others will probably prove impractical and be replaced doublelayered plastic covering covering the plastic greenhouse with two layers of plastic instead of one and inflating the air space in between using a small fan makes the covering more airtight and more heatretentive even some glass houses are being covered with a plastic outer shell to aid in heat retention the principle disadvantage of the extra plastic layer is the reduction in light intensity foundation insulation large amounts of heat are lost through the concrete or wooden sides of the greenhouse the siding material may be supportive or merely provide a skirt between the glass and the ground in either case the addition of insulation can plug an important area of heat loss the insulation can be an earthen bank against the outside of the wall it can also be a layer of insulating material such as fiberboard or foilcovered styrofoam against the interior wall with pierced concrete block foundations the holes can be filled with insulating material at the time of construction north wall insulation with no direct sunlight entering through the north wall of the greenhouse and maximum heat loss occurring there the north wall is an energy liability some commercial and university greenhouse ranges are experimenting with full groundtoroof insulation of the north wall using concrete or wood and appropriate insulating material the energy saved is proving to be significant and the light reduction minimal thermal blanket over crops most of the heat loss in a greenhouse occurs after dark hence that is when fuel consumption is greatest heating the air between the crop and the greenhouse roof at night has been a necessary evil in the past although admittedly of no value to the plants now a thin thermal blanket supported on wires can be pulled over the plants at night to hold warmth around the benches where it is needed the principal drawback to this technique can be the awkwardness of its operation if handpulled across the crop it results in a loss of some daylight because the greenhouse staff does not report for work at sunrise each day nor work until dark automated blanket systems have been developed and are gaining industry acceptance nationwide other methods other energysaving techniques are being devised by researchers worldwide lining greenhouse benches with black plastic tubes of water is one such technique in theory the water tubes will absorb sunlight energy during the day and release it slowly at night tighter sealing of glass glazing panels is another technique for slowing heat escape from the glass greenhouse the installation of a plastic false ceiling to cut off some of the roof space that otherwise requires heating can also reduce energy needs windbreaks are also being used in some operations in which there is sufficient land around the greenhouse if properly designed and not placed so close that they reduce the amount of light windbreaks can reduce the temperature lowering effect of winds it is also logical and imperative that the greenhouse operator keep the heating system in good condition to maximize its efficiency and repair cracks or tears in the glazing loose panels or damaged door seals as soon as they are discovered many methods are being tried the next decade will begin to see their results there is no question that the greenhouse industry has entered into a period of change,greenhouse ventilation and cooling are critical for uniform plant growth temperature regulation and disease prevention air circulation systems include roof and side vents exhaust fans and convection tubes that draw in fresh air remove stagnant air and prevent mildew growth cooling methods vary based on season and region shading reduces light intensity by using temporary sprays or sun screens while ventilators let in cooler air sometimes aided by retractable roofs that allow natural airflow evaporative cooling such as fanandpad or fog systems lowers greenhouse temperatures by up to 1030f creating a favorable environment for plants without direct water contact energy conservation strategies address rising fuel costs focusing on heat retention through doublelayered plastic covers foundation insulation and north wall insulation minimizing heat loss thermal blankets keep warmth near plants at night while black water tubes on benches store solar heat by day and release it at night additional methods include tightly sealed glazing panels windbreaks and regular heating system maintenance which collectively optimize energy use reduce costs and maintain ideal conditions for greenhouse cultivation ensuring sustainable production for diverse plant types across regions
greenhouse benches the benches of a greenhouse may be raised or at ground level they may actually contain the crop or merely support it the style of benches materials used and arrangement within the greenhouse all depend on the crop being grown however regardless of the crop grown or style of bench selected greenhouse benches must fulfill three functions 1 they must drain quickly 2 they must be of a width that allows workers to reach into their center 3 they must maximize the crops exposure to light the choice of bench styles depends on the crop being grown for example greenhouse vegetable production principally of tomatoes and lettuce requires ground beds production methods are similar to those used in field plantings but the ground beds need special preparation for proper drainage such preparation includes approximately six inches of crushed stone beneath six to eight inches of porous soil and a properly installed drainage tile system to provide for subsoil drainage similar bed construction is required if the ground benches are used for cut flowers such as roses the benches are usually limited to three feet in width to allow access to the center of the bed by workers who must tie the crop cut the blossoms and so forth sides may be built as an edging for the ground beds to define walkways more clearly and reduce the possibility of plant injury figure 1917 raised benches are used in the production of pot crops as well as cut flower crops in the case of potted plants the bench serves much like a table to bring the crop up to a level where it can be worked on easily with cut flower crops the bench not only elevates the crop but also contains the growing medium for the plants as such it must be from 6 to 12 inches deep to allow for proper root development and drainage figures 1918 and 1919 raising the bench above ground allows air to flow more freely around the crop and permits a warmer rootzone temperature to be maintained often heating lines are placed beneath the benches to attain maximum benefit from the warmth a framework of pipe constructed above a regular bench increases the amount of growing space within a greenhouse by permitting hanging baskets to be grown above another crop figure 1920 bench materials greenhouse benches may be purchased as prefabricated units or improvised by the grower to fit particular needs the most important quality of a bench is capacity for rapid drainage a number of materials are commonly used wood rot resistant choices such as redwood cedar or cypress are durable but expensive aluminum very durable and expensive welded wire fabric wooden slats less durable and less expensive spruce or redwood lath with concrete block legs concrete long popular for ground beds it is both durable and expensive polypropylene tops on a support frame wooden supports metal pipes concrete blocks and wire fabric or lath can be combined easily to make an affordable bench that can be adapted to all types of containerized crops care should be given to preserving any wood used in bench construction either naturally rotresistant woods such as redwood or preservativetreated woods stained with cooper naphthanate can be used bench arrangements since crops cannot be grown and money cannot be made in space devoted to aisles greenhouse benches are arranged carefully to provide the greatest area for growing space the number and width of aisles are determined by the width of the carts needed in the aisles and whether the crop can be worked from one side or needs to be accessible from both three methods of arranging benches in greenhouses are commonly used figures 1921 1922 and 1923 to increase the efficient use of space in greenhouses employing raised benches some growers have placed benches atop rolling pipes thereby permitting the movement of benches back and forth figures 1924a b this system eliminates the need for permanent aisles and reduces their numbers essentially the aisle can be shifted to where it is needed plant growing structures exist to provide consistent controlled environmental conditions for the growth of plants there are several different types of structures greenhouses exist in many forms depending on their age location and use they can be built of aluminum iron steel or wood and glazed with glass hard plastic or soft plastic their styles include 1 detached aframe truss 2 ridgeandfurrow aframe truss and 3 quonset other growing structures include shade or lath houses cold frames hotbeds and high tunnels typical structural plans for these structures are included in the chapter the material selected to cover the growing structure depends on the amount of light needed the length of service required and the time and cost of materials and maintenance that the grower can accept greenhouses require heating systems to supplement natural solar heat by day and at night the choices include central steam or hot water systems and unit heaters each has advantages and disadvantages greenhouses are ventilated by using roof and side ventilators exhaust fans fanandconvectiontube systems or a retractable roof ventilation is needed to distribute air evenly throughout the greenhouse maintain consistent temperatures and reduce the risk of disease the need to cool the greenhouse is greatest during the summer months three approaches to cooling are used depending on the time of year and geographic location of the greenhouse shading the glass ventilation or heat exchange and water evaporation energy conservation has become increasingly important in recent years as expensive fuels have sent greenhouse production costs climbing techniques such as doublelayered plastic coverings foundation insulation north wall insulation and thermal blankets are being tried now the future will see additional techniques developed the style of benches the materials used in their construction and their arrangement within the greenhouse all depend on the crops being grown benches may be raised or at ground level they may contain the crops or merely support them they may be commercially prefabricated or improvised they may be arranged as crossbenching peninsular benching or lengthofhouse benching regardless of these differences all benches must drain quickly be of a width that allows workers to reach into their center and allow crops maximum exposure to light,greenhouse benches are essential for supporting and cultivating crops with options that vary by crop type bench style materials and arrangement benches may be raised or at ground level ensuring quick drainage appropriate width for worker access and optimal light exposure for plant growth ground beds are commonly used for crops like tomatoes and lettuce incorporating a special drainage system of crushed stone porous soil and tiles to manage moisture raised benches preferred for potted plants and some cut flowers elevate crops to improve accessibility airflow and root warmth common materials include durable but costly options like aluminum and concrete and more economical choices like rotresistant woods welded wire and pipe frames all aimed at effective drainage benches are arranged in crossbenching peninsular or lengthwise styles to maximize growing space with innovations such as rolling benches to minimize fixed aisles greenhouses themselves made from materials like aluminum or wood with glass or plastic glazing vary in style and require precise heating and ventilation systems to maintain a stable environment energyefficient practices such as doublelayered coverings and insulation help reduce operational costs key concepts include bench structure material selection bench arrangement and greenhouse environmental controls
greenhouse production techniques crop production scheduling the production of greenhouse crops can be compared to the manufacture of nonplant items in one way scheduling its important no one buys a poinsettia on december twentysixth or an easter lily on the monday after easter retail florists need large quantities of red roses for valentines day and they sell more mums during the autumn than the spring in northern states bedding plants are of interest to consumers for about a sixweek period in the spring and after that they can barely be given away unlike other manufacturers who can store excess inventories greenhouse growers lose their perishable products and the money invested in them if they dont sell timing is everything in the flower production business to serve the market when consumer demand is greatest and minimize losses due to overproduction or underproduction greenhouse growers plant care for and harvest their crops in accordance with production schedules in theory plant production schedules are logical and not difficult to follow a particular crop can be expected to require a certain number of weeks at a given temperature to go from seed or cutting to harvest by counting backward from the desired harvest date the date of planting can be determined by keeping accurate yearly records a grower can determine whether to increase or decrease the number of plants produced dates of pinching fertilizing shading application of growth retardants or repotting can be determined from previous years data or provided by seed or cutting suppliers theory meets reality though when unexpected warm weather sends greenhouse temperatures soaring above those specified in the crops production schedule and crop development advances by a week in only a day or two equally troublesome is an extended period of overcast skies an outbreak of disease a malfunctioning heating system or a disrupted photoperiod at a critical stage of plant development that is when growers must apply their education and past experience to compensate for the unexpected and get the crop back on schedule complete crop records are essential for effective production scheduling in addition growers must stay attuned to the economic forecast to anticipate changes in consumer buying if last year was a record year for sales but the current years forecasts are for restrained consumer spending the crop should be reduced on the other hand when a downward trend in the economy is followed by a steady increase more plants can be grown for sale greenhouse root media greenhouse plants are grown in a wide variety of root media including those that contain actual soil as well as those that are entirely soilless the media can be formulated by the grower adapting and modifying one of the traditional mixes such as those described in chapter 14 or the media can be purchased from commercial sources whether soilcontaining or soilless root media must all do the same things provide nutrients to the plant retain water for use by the plant allow aeration for the roots and anchor the plant firmly in the container or bench the research comparisons between greenhouse crops grown in soil versus those grown in artificial media are extensive however the growers decision to use one medium rather than another is likely to be based on economic factors more than research findings is there a close source of good field soil that can fill ground beds or benches is the potted crop going to be shipped over a long distance making weight a cost and handling factor does the grower have the facilities and desire to mix and pasteurize large quantities of soil or is a readymixed product more practical when field soils are used in greenhouse crop production they must be conditioned and pasteurized drainage is essential so sand peat vermiculite fired clay and even gravel may be added even a loam soil ideal for nursery and landscape use is not satisfactory for greenhouse use without additives pasteurization with steam or chemicals is needed because of the presence of weed seeds pathogens and insects in the soil the specifics of pasteurization are described later in this chapter once in the greenhouse bench the soil may serve for many years if properly reconditioned after each crop is harvested while good field soil in a bench offers the cultural predictability that is essential to highquality crop production the unpredictability of field soil taken from different sources each time is what led to the development and widespread use of soilless mixes for potted crops the commercially prepared soilless mixes differ in their formulations but not in their functions regardless of brand names the artificial mixes are either barkbased or peat mossbased mixes brand name examples of each formulation include barkbased growing media ball growing mixes i and ii choice container mix fafard mix number 3 and 4 metro mixes 300 350 and 500 promix peatbark mix stronglite bark mix vj 1 mix and 3 mix peatbased growing media ball germinating mix fafard peatlite mix jiffy mix jiffy mix plus ogilvie professional mixes 2 and 5 premier germinating mix promix a rediearth peat lite mix sunshine mixes the principal advantage of artificial root media is their uniformity of composition and the predictable response of plants to fertilization watering and other production techniques when grown in them by using soilless media a grower eliminates one of the variables that can make production difficult an added advantage is that these media are lightweight making their handling less burdensome some also contain small amounts of starter fertilizers andor a gel to retain moisture pasteurizing the media greenhouse growing media that contain field soil or artificial media that have been exposed or previously used can contain undesirable microorganisms insects and weeds the elimination of these undesirables is termed pasteurization unlike sterilization which kills all life in the soil pasteurization kills just the harmful elements soil pasteurization is preferred to sterilization and fortunately is easier to accomplish pasteurization is usually accomplished either with steam or with chemical fumigants the fumigants are more expensive than steam which is usually available from the greenhouse heating system however some weeds are not killed by the 180 f soil temperature of steam treatment and require fumigation small quantities of soil may be pasteurized with electric heat but it is not a common method for commercial use steam is applied to the bench pots or ground beds in different ways from the surface through pipes buried in the soil in a closed container for bench soil pasteurization benches must have evenly spaced openings in the bottom to permit air to escape as steam enters surface steaming surface steaming like all steaming is done after the soil is conditioned and of uniform consistency all nutrients and ph adjustors should be mixed evenly into the soil before steaming except those that would be harmed by the treatment such as timerelease fertilizers formulated with plastic coatings the soil is then leveled in the bench and a perforated pipe or hose is placed on top to distribute the steam evenly down the bench one pipe or hose is used per three feet or less of bench width next at intervals of four to five feet down the center of the bench inverted flats or concrete blocks are set into place finally a solid cover such as a canvas tarpaulin or sheet of heavy plastic is placed over the bench and weighted down around the outside edge the flats or blocks prevent the cover from adhering to the soil figure 201 steam is then introduced into the perforated pipe or hose from the boiler probe thermometers placed into the medium at intervals around the bench record the soil temperature as the steam permeates it when the most distant parts of the bench attain a soil temperature of 180 f or 140 f if air is being injected into the steam for thirty minutes or longer pasteurization is complete the tarp blocks and pipes can be removed and the soil permitted to cool for planting buried pipes buried pipes are a preferred method of steaming if ground beds are being pasteurized although the technique is also suitable for benches in this method perforated pipes are placed in the center of the bench and then buried at onehalf or more of the soils depth the bench is covered and the temperature measured as in surface steaming closed container steaming closed container steaming is used for pots and other containers with or without soil in them it may also be used for tools and other production materials that could be contaminated a thermometer must be outside the container to permit temperature reading chemical fumigants where growers do not have the facilities for steaming soil they must use chemical fumigants the fumigation should be done outside the greenhouse to help avoid injury to greenhouse crops or workers since many of the products are toxic to plants or humans benches can be disinfested with a dilute antiseptic the fumigants are in two forms pressurized gas canisters and liquids that turn to gas after application the pile of soil being fumigated must be covered with a gasimpermeable canopy to hold in the gas and allow it to permeate the soil the toxicity of some of the products is one of the disadvantages of fumigation another disadvantage is the waiting time required before the soil can be planted without injury to the crop up to three weeks may be needed for safety the fumigants currently used are chloropicrin tear gas vapam and formalin,greenhouse crop production requires precise scheduling to align plant maturity with market demand as perishable goods cannot be stored timing is key with growers using detailed production schedules to optimize planting growth and harvest cycles unexpected conditions like unplanned warm weather or disease may disrupt these schedules requiring growers to adapt based on experience maintaining accurate crop records helps in adjusting production for future seasons greenhouse plants can be grown in either soilbased or soilless media which support root nutrition moisture aeration and anchoring soilbased media need conditioning and pasteurization to remove pests and pathogens while soilless mixes offer uniformity and are lighter for handling pasteurization which kills harmful organisms without sterilizing the soil can be achieved by steam surface buried pipes or container methods or chemical fumigants though chemicals require ventilation and waiting periods key concepts and definitions crop scheduling planning crop cycles to meet market demand root media growth material supporting plant roots with soilbased and soilless options pasteurization process to kill pests in growth media without complete sterilization fumigants chemicals used to sterilize media when steam pasteurization isnt viable
soil tests one important item of the greenhouse production schedule is regular soil testing for both bench crops and potted plants the grower should not wait until plants display symptoms of difficulty before soil testing tests should be run monthly on benches with crops the frequency of testing needed for potted plants will depend on how long the particular crop takes to reach harvest size for example potted azaleas require more production time than most herbaceous plants they also require an acidic ph several soil tests are needed during their production to ensure optimal growth growers need soil tests for three main reasons 1 to check the ph 2 to check for nutrient deficiencies 3 to measure the soluble salt content soil acidity is important in the production of certain crops such as the azaleas noted above and needs to be measured whenever field soil is used in the growing medium or in regions where irrigation water may alter the ph testing for the level of nitrates phosphates and potash in the growing media is usually sufficient unless another deficiency or excess is suspected any of several commercially available soil test kits can provide the grower with sameday results the doityourself kits are affordable easy to use and generally accurate enough to be of use to the grower more accurate tests can be performed by the states college of agriculture or commercial labs but there is a time lag of several days or longer soil samples need to be selected from several parts of the bench or from random pots of a crop then mixed dried and tested figure 202 the most reliable results will be obtained if 1 the same person does the testing each time 2 all glassware is kept clean and rinsed each time with distilled water 3 the reagents are fresh and kept in a cool dark storage space when not in use regularly scheduled reordering of the reagents rather than waiting until the old ones are gone will ensure their freshness knowledge of the soils soluble salt levels is considered by many growers and educators to be even more important than ph information for good greenhouse production the soluble salts of a soil can be increased by steam pasteurization excessive fertilization and failure of the irrigation water to drain sufficiently to leach the fertilizers from the soil soluble salt levels can be measured easily using a conductivitytds meter figure 203 most college courses in soil science or greenhouse production include training in soil testing all the techniques required for greenhouse production are easily learned obtaining a truly representative soil sample and maintaining consistency in the testing are the most difficult aspects greenhouse containers the containers selected for use in greenhouse potted plant production vary depending on the crop and the time of year pots are round containers whose height and diameter are equal made of clay styrofoam or hard plastic they are used for production and sale made in small sizes of pressed peat moss they are used for rooting seeding and transplanting azalea pots are round containers with the height threefourths the diameter they are preferred by some growers for the production of poinsettias and chrysanthemums as well as azaleas pans are containers the height of which is onehalf the diameter they are preferred by some growers for bulbous flowers such as tulips and hyacinths clay containers are porous plastic is not therefore gas and air can permeate clay containers and soil dries more rapidly this is advantageous during the winter season when plants can often be too wet in the nonporous plastic containers the situation reverses in the warmer months when clay may permit soil to dry out too quickly although popular for centuries clay containers are declining in use by growers plastic containers may be either hard or of styrofoam either is much lighter than clay and is often a reason why plastic is preferred by a grower plastic containers cannot be heat pasteurized though whereas clay containers can be heated without fear of their melting also the combination of lightweight container and artificial soil can result in topheavy plants so clay containers will probably always have their proponents figure 204 peat pots are manufactured either individually or in strips similar to egg cartons they range in diameter from one and onehalf to four inches they are a great convenience for transplanting because there is no need to remove the pot it is set directly into the new container or garden where it decomposes the peat container is fragile especially after being wet and will not tolerate much movement growers usually place them in flats which will be described shortly to provide the support necessary for moving and handling peat pots and strips figure 205 are widely used for the production of bedding plants they are also used for the production of liningout stock these will be described in chapter 21 molded plastic packs are also used for greenhouse production especially for bedding plants they resemble icecube trays and are available in different sizes since they do not decompose in the soil plants must be removed for transplanting they are firmer than peat strips and are salable as they are they also retain moisture better than peat strips hanging baskets are specialized production containers made of wire or plastic figure 206 the baskets may be solid or meshed the mesh baskets require a liner to hold the soil and they drip after being watered the solid baskets require no liner nor do they drip flats are shallow rectangular containers that may be used to start seedlings root cuttings or hold less sturdy peat pots and strips traditionally constructed of inexpensive wood often as an offseason job for greenhouse workers flats may also be made of plastic the plastic flats are manufactured to hold a number of the molded plastic packs neatly figure 207 understandably the size of the containers determines the amount of pasteurized growing medium needed at the time of planting and transplanting table 201 developed by dr p a hammer of purdue university can help growers determine their needs in advance reproduction methods chapter 14 details the main methods used by ornamental horticulturists for reproducing plants greenhouse production uses some reproduction methods more than others for particular purposes seed for production of bedding plants and geraniums runners for foliage plants like the spider plant bulbs for flowering perennials like tulips daffodils crocuses and gladioli layering for foliage plants like the fig and rubber plant cuttings for geraniums chrysanthemums and many foliage plants grafting for some azaleas budding for roses division of the crown for foliage plants and african violets tissue and organ culturing for orchids and bromeliads and for production of diseasefree stock for chrysanthemums carnations and other flowering plants the greenhouse grower may propagate the crops and grow them to maturity or buy cuttings and other propagative stock from firms that specialize in propagation of the numerous methods of reproduction used by greenhouse growers seeds and cuttings are the most common figure 208 despite the comparative ease of propagation by cuttings many species are protected by plant patents that require new cuttings to be purchased each time from the supplier spacing and labeling a crop the spacing of a greenhouse crop has a direct impact on the costs of production and the quality of the crop closer spacing permits more plants to be grown but if it is too close it reduces the quality of the product spacing that is too great produces excellent plants but at the expense of crop numbers and profit different methods of growing require different techniques of spacing with bench crop production the spacing decision made at the time of planting remains unchanged throughout the life of the crop potted crop production can be the same with no movement of the pots after planting termed fixed spacing or the crop can be started in small pots with close spacing and both container size and spacing can be increased as the crop matures termed expanding spacing for example the crop may be started in threeinch pots and advance through several transplantings to mature size in sixinch pots each transplanting requires labor and more space the space can only be provided by moving out some other crop when certain holidays fall close together such as valentines day and easter or easter and mothers day there may not be enough time to space out the next crop before damage is done due to close spacing expanding spacing is commonly practiced though and probably will continue to be expanding and fixed spacing are compared and summarized in table 202 whether spacing bench crops or potted plants the objectives are the same the plants must receive adequate sunlight and air to permit photosynthesis to proceed unimpaired crowded spacing can reduce photosynthesis and increase the possibility of disease due to shaded overly moist foliage and reduced air circulation where expanding spacing is used the dates of repotting and spacing must be part of the production schedule for each crop consideration must also be given to future crops as the current crop reaches maturity its time of sale must be anticipated to permit the wider spacing of another crop labeling the crop is the means of identifying the plants on the bench it is necessary where different varieties of similar plants are grown since they often cannot be identified otherwise until they flower chrysanthemums and geraniums are two common examples but exotic orchids are just as easily confused when only the foliage is visible bench crops are often labeled on the end of the bench when a single variety is being grown potted crops may be labeled on each container especially if the crop is protected by a patent these labels are furnished by the propagator supplier other potted crops are not individually labeled instead the pot closest to the front and the left side of the bench is labeled all plants spaced behind and to the right are the same variety until the next label marks the next variety figure 209 in addition to the variety name the label may contain information such as the flower color date of planting and date of harvest,in greenhouse production soil tests are essential for monitoring ph nutrient levels and soluble salts testing should occur monthly for crops grown in soil benches and as required for potted plants based on their growth cycle with tools such as conductivity meters and diy kits providing rapid results greenhouse containers vary based on the crop climate and seasonal needs and include pots peat pots plastic packs flats and hanging baskets each with specific moisture retention and durability characteristics reproduction methods in greenhouses include seed sowing cuttings grafting and tissue culturing with each method catering to specific plants and propagation needs the spacing of crops affects their quality and production efficiency with methods like fixed and expanding spacing applied based on crop maturity adequate spacing is critical for air circulation and sunlight exposure to minimize disease risk labeling helps identify varieties particularly in potted crops ensuring accurate organization and tracking through different growth stages key points regular soil testing to ensure optimal ph nutrients and salt levels different container types support diverse plant needs multiple propagation methods tailored for different plants proper spacing critical for plant quality and disease prevention labeling used for identification and organization of crop varieties
watering greenhouse crops are watered either by hand with a hose or with semiautomatic watering systems in large greenhouse ranges handwatering is too timeconsuming and automated systems are necessary watering done correctly becomes irrigation the maintenance of a proper balance of both moisture and air in the soil of the crops too much water leaves too little air space and the root system may rot or at least be dwarfed too little water does not sufficiently drive old air out through the bottom and draw fresh air in from the top too little water can also cause shallow root development soluble salt buildup and reduced plant and blossom size the amount of water applied to greenhouse plants is totally under the control of the grower nature can be blamed for a lot that goes wrong in a greenhouse but not a water excess or deficiency correct irrigation techniques are not the same for all crops nor are they uniform for a single crop throughout the year the first and perhaps most difficult thing that a new greenhouse worker must be taught is how to water plants correctly proper irrigation can be encapsulated as follows sufficient water should be applied each time to drain from the bench or pot slightly but not excessively potted plants must have room at the top of the container for water the soil level in each pot must be the same surface drying of the soil between irrigations is desirable it permits new air to enter the soil clay containers require more frequent watering than plastic containers larger plants require more water than smaller plants artificial media require more frequent watering than allpeat or field soil media less irrigation is needed during the winter and on cloudy days than in the summer and on sunny days the need for water should not be determined by sticking a finger into the soil if a systemic pesticide has been used on the crop the pesticide may be toxic and absorbed through the skin potted plants and benches do not dry out uniformly usually the soil at the edge of a bench or the pots along the edges dry sooner than those at the center of the bench also plants nearest the heating system or ventilators can be expected to need water sooner than other plants the determination to water must be based on the needs of plants away from these early drying locations even semiautomated irrigation systems may require handwatering of crops in the early drying locations several kinds of moisture meters are available to help determine when to water and how much to apply they are not foolproof and should be regarded as guides only fertilizers and pesticides can be applied as liquids through the irrigation system to do so saves time water should be applied at the base of the plants wetting foliage should be avoided watering should be completed early enough so that surface water can dry before nightfall handwatering greenhouse hoses are usually threequarters of an inch in diameter and flexible for easy handling they must either extend the full length of the benches they are to water or at least reach the center if the water supply is at both ends of the greenhouse an assortment of nozzles is manufactured for greenhouse use some are breakers which diminish the force of the water but not the rate of flow others are foggers which permit the water to be applied as a fine mist to seedlings and other tender plants water should never be applied at a rate of flow that furrows the soil in the bench or the container to do so creates a condition favoring uneven water absorption thereafter when watering a hose should first be stretched down the aisle to its full length the crop should then be irrigated while moving with the hose back toward the faucet two benches may be watered from one aisle a pattern of watering should be established and followed so that the technique becomes almost habitual for example the nozzle and hose can be extended between rows of pots and both rows irrigated from the rear of the bench forward regardless of the pattern each pot should be filled to the top with water as a means of assuring that each container receives the same amount each time the technique is imprecise but the best possible with hand application figure 2010 handwatering is more effective with potted crops than bench crops the rate of application to a bench can be very inconsistent note to avoid possible contamination by pathogens the hose end should rest in a clip between uses it should not be allowed to fall on the ground also the sun can heat the water in a hose to temperatures that will injure the crop so let the water run until cool before applying to the plants semiautomatic watering semiautomatic irrigation systems can be timesaving for large greenhouse operations most are designed for bench production but systems for potted plant production also exist the systems are designed to apply a standard amount of water to a crop by linking the system to appropriate controls several benches or crops can be watered in succession however the grower must still determine the frequency of irrigation and the amount of water to be applied the system must be checked frequently to ensure that no nozzles are clogged and that no leaks have developed in the pipes or tubes the semiautomatic systems may be directed spray systems trickle systems or ebb and flood systems spray systems deliver the water through nozzles spaced at intervals along the pipes which run around the perimeter of the greenhouse bench trickle systems deliver the water through holes in inflatable plastic tubes stretched down the bench figure 2011 a form of trickle system is used for potted plants nicknamed the spaghetti system it delivers water through thin plastic tubes attached by pins or weights to the pot on one end and to a threequarter inch pvc pipe on the other end the pvc pipe runs the length of the bench to transport the water figure 2012 other forms of trickle systems include ooze tubes and water loops ooze tubes are plastic tubes that are rolled out in rows between plants growing as bench crops water seeps from the tubes through small holes at intervals along its length ooze tubes are especially important where water conservation is needed since they deliver water in low volumes figure 2013 water loops are used for irrigating container grown plants they are small rings of plastic that are placed around the base of each plant within its container a header carries the water to each container where it trickles from the loop onto the media surface like all trickle systems the water loop is a lowpressure delivery system not quite fitting into the category of trickle systems is the capillary mat most suitable for the production of potted plants that should not have wet foliage this mat is made of fibrous material and is placed on a bench that is first lined with plastic figure 2014 water and nutrient solutions periodically flood the mat and are then absorbed by the plant through capillary action the mat system is also useful for the production of plants in pots of various sizes the system has the disadvantages of becoming unsightly due to algal growth and harboring insects and pathogens within the matting periodic sterilization of the mat and bench is needed ebb and flood irrigation does not trickle it floods water is pumped from a storage tank into a watertight bench where it flows across the surface flooding the entire bench after about twenty minutes the liquid is drained back into the storage tank for reuse an ebb and flood system permits water soluble fertilizers to be applied concurrent with watering the system is used for pot crop production in both raised benches and in greenhouses where crops are grown directly on the floor since all pots receive the water at the same time they absorb an equal volume of liquid the system is monitored and controlled by computer figure 2015 fertilizing fertilizers can be applied to greenhouse crops in dry or liquid form if applied in dry form the fertilizer may be incorporated as the soil is mixed and before it is pasteurized unless a slowrelease fertilizer is used in that case the fertilizer can be incorporated after pasteurization nutrients can be replenished later by supplemental applications of dry fertilizers to the surface of the benches dry fertilizers require time to apply especially if slowrelease forms are not used for potted crops repeated application of dry fertilizer adds to labor costs slowrelease dry fertilizer is believed to be used more efficiently by the plant with less loss through leaching than fertilizer applied in quickly available dry form the popular alternative to dry fertilizer is liquid fertilizer dissolved in water and applied as the crop is irrigated such methods save on labor but use more fertilizer overall the greenhouse watering system is the most common means of applying liquid fertilizer to crops three types of systems are used the venturi proportioner the positive displacement pump and the eductor in each case concentrated liquid fertilizer is held in a container and injected into the greenhouse irrigation system when water is used or when fertilization is desired 1 the venturi proportioner draws the fertilizer into the water system through a small tube that connects the water hose to the fertilizer concentrate as the water pressure and flow rate vary so does the rate at which the concentrate mixes with the water the venturi proportioner is not precise but is serviceable for many crops 2 the positive displacement pump may be waterdriven or use an electric motor to power a fertilizer concentrate pump it maintains a uniform proportion of fertilizer to water regardless of the water pressure or rate of flow it is usually not adjustable to permit a change of the injection ratio 3 the eductor places the fertilizer concentrate in a pliable bag surrounded by water under pressure as the pressure increases it forces the fertilizer through a metering system and into the water line the eductor system is a flexible one that does permit the injection ratio to be varied under normal operating conditions it maintains a constant proportion of concentrate to water these fertilization systems must be checked for accuracy at least once each year and should be one of the first things checked if a crop begins to show signs of trouble the choice of a system is usually based on the size of the operation whether the injection ratios will be standard or must be varied whether the system will be mobile or permanently installed and how easily a particular system can be serviced when necessary fertilizers for the injectors can be mixed by the grower or purchased premixed from suppliers either way the fertilizers must be easily soluble in water and contain a dye that will be visible in the water supply even when highly diluted to provide a visual check that the system is working the amount of fertilizer applied per application depends on the strength of the concentrate the dilution ratio of the injector and the amount of water applied most commonly a ratio of 1100 one part concentrate to ninetynine parts water is used but 1200 is not uncommon if fertilizer is only applied every few weeks the concentrate must be stronger if applied with each watering the concentrate must be weaker,greenhouse irrigation is critical for balancing soil moisture and air promoting healthy root development watering can be done manually with hoses or semiautomatically through systems tailored to the needs of different plants manual watering though timeintensive allows handson control while semiautomated systems like spray trickle ebbandflood and capillary mats are more efficient in large greenhouses spray systems distribute water through nozzles around bench perimeters while trickle systems use tubes for steady controlled watering ebbandflood setups flood the bench allowing even moisture absorption while capillary mats wick water to plants roots making them ideal for potted plants with minimal foliage wetting effective irrigation involves careful timingallowing soil to dry slightly between waterings to draw fresh air into the soil this enhances root health and reduces risks like root rot or shallow root growth fertilization vital for crop nutrition can be dry or liquid with liquid fertilizers commonly applied through injectors venturi proportioners positive displacement pumps or eductors these systems mix concentrated fertilizer into irrigation water at controlled ratios for best results irrigation and fertilization systems require regular monitoring ensuring even distribution and preventing nozzle clogging or leaks proper irrigation and fertilization routines help greenhouse crops thrive by meeting precise water and nutrient needs yearround
pest control greenhouses provide an ideal environment for plants and pests alike the conditions of high temperature and high humidity coupled with close spacing of a monoculture make pest control a necessary element in the greenhouse production schedule also necessary is employees cooperation and understanding of how they can personally assist in the control effort pest control should be included in the job training for all greenhouse workers chapter 6 describes the pests of ornamental plants insects infectious parasitic pathogens weeds and other injurious agents it also describes the profitable control level sought by growers and the four principles of control efforts to prevent pests from becoming established in the greenhouse apply the principle of exclusion for example sources for plant materials that guarantee diseasefree and insectfree stock are essential eradication another principle of control seeks to remove or eliminate pests that are already present in the greenhouse destruction of infected or infested plants elimination of alternate host weeds beneath benches soil pasteurization and use of chemical sprays all apply the principle of eradication protection is the third principle of control it seeks to place a barrier between the crop and the pests screens on greenhouse vents and doors and growth conditions that favor the hosts more than the pests are methods of protection spraying plants with chemicals before insects or pathogens arrive also applies the principle of protection the principle of resistance is applied each time a grower selects a resistant variety for production pathogenic inoculum insects and weed seeds enter the greenhouse in numerous ways insect eggs viruses fungal spores or bacteria can be on cuttings or stock plants purchased from another grower oxalis other weed seeds and nematodes can be in the soil of plants purchased for forcing pests may be carried in by the wind on equipment or on the shoes and clothing of greenhouse workers in retail operations every customer who comes through the door is a potential source of inoculum of many common greenhouse pests once inside the greenhouse pests are disseminated by irrigation water air currents workers hoses and other contaminated tools pest control in greenhouses is complicated by two factors 1 the complex life cycle of many insects and some fungi that allows them to be unaffected by many chemical pesticides throughout much of their lives 2 the rapid development of resistance to particular pesticides that characterizes some pests especially insects for example many insecticides are only effective against the adult stages of an insect the larval nymph and egg stages may not be affected at all by a fumigant or spray hence two or three days after spraying the crop can again be overrun with insects such as whiteflies an insecticide may have to be applied every two or three days for a month to control a succession of adult populations before they are able to lay eggs the problem of natural resistance develops when the same pesticide is used repeatedly no spray dust or fumigant kills 100 percent of a pest population a few are always unaffected as they survive and breed a pest population builds within the greenhouse immune to the pesticide that once controlled effectively to avoid the buildup of resistant pest populations a grower must rotate the choice of pesticides frequently this should be part of the production schedule for each crop common forms of greenhouse pesticides depending on the crop the size of the operation the pesticide being used and the equipment available greenhouse growers apply chemical pesticides in one or more of the following forms systemics these may be applied as soil drenches or as foliar sprays they remain in the plant and kill the pest when it arrives sprays the material is mixed with water in a hydraulic sprayer and applied to the foliage of the crop a spreadersticker agent may be needed to provide uniform coverage of the foliage all parts of the plant must be covered or the untouched insects will remain alive careless or incomplete spraying accomplishes little more than temporary population reduction dusts coverage must be thorough as with sprays a duster can cover a large area of crops quickly and often at less expense than sprays many greenhouse pesticides are not available in dust form however aerosol bombs the pesticide material is packaged in a container with a propellant liquid or gas that disperses the pesticide uniformly through the greenhouse the grower must calculate the cubic area of the greenhouse before use to ensure that the proper amount of pesticide is applied aerosols are quick and easy to apply but expensive smoke fumigants the pesticide is packaged with a flammable smokeproducing material when the container is lit the smoke carries the pesticide throughout the greenhouse and to all parts of the crop as with aerosols the cubic area of the greenhouse must be calculated for correct application steam line vaporizers the pesticide is painted onto cold steam lines then all vents of the greenhouse are closed and the steam turned on the chemical vaporizes and fills the house cubic areas must be calculated foggers the grower must mix the pesticide in an oil solvent and fill the fogger the fogger then heats the mixture causing it to disperse uniformly the oil can plug the machines so thorough cleaning is important misters the pesticide is mixed with a solvent that evaporates quickly once out of the mister an air blast disperses the mixture in a fine mist sprays and dusts often leave a residue of pesticide on the plant leaves that may prove objectionable to consumers certain systemics can remain invisible yet toxic in the soil for many weeks their application must be discontinued far enough in advance of their sale to ensure that the plant product is safe for release to consumers growers who produce vegetables must take special care that no pesticides will remain active in the plant because eventually it will be consumed by humans specific recommendations for greenhouse pest control are available from state colleges of agriculture and cooperative extension specialists many states also have active florist trade associations that share common problems and solutions through newsletters and statewide meetings it is important for growers to take part in these associations pesticide safety in the greenhouse the safe application of pesticides in the greenhouse or elsewhere requires an understanding that the health of the plant is more important than killing the pest the health of the greenhouse staff and the consumer are more important than either the crops or the pests sometimes priorities can get confused and risks are taken to produce a marketable product regardless of the dangers other times safety procedures are bypassed for reasons of expediency or personal comfort but people are more important than plants or pests is the first rule of safe pesticide use for a review of pesticide safety see chapter 6 safety rules should be posted where all staff and supervisors can see them frequently the rules should be enforced without exception where the level of toxicity is high as indicated by the skull and crossbones on the label workers should wear protective equipment during all contact with the material mixing application and cleanup this equipment includes rubber boots gloves pants hat raincoat face shield and gas mask for the application of a highly toxic spray figure 2016 too often in hot weather workers want to spray without donning the rubber suits such a practice should not be condoned by the supervisor either a less toxic pesticide should be selected or a fumigant or similar form used that eliminates the danger to the applicator another danger of pesticide use is that people will reenter the greenhouse too soon after the pesticide has been applied the reentry time in hours or days is specified on the pesticide label and should be adhered to strictly after spraying a warning sign should be posted on the greenhouse doors and the reentry time noted the greenhouse should be aired as much as the weather permits following the pesticide application if systemic pesticides are used for potted plants workers must be careful not to touch the soil in the pots when expanding spacing or disbudding or staking are required it is nearly impossible to avoid coming in contact with the soil in such cases workers should wear plastic or rubber gloves this is another situation in which workers will object the gloves are hot and hands perspire quickly safety not personal comfort must be given priority and the rule enforced integrated pest management as noted in chapter 6 the most current approach to pest control in greenhouses is integrated pest management ipm is a step back from total reliance on pesticides to play the lead role in profitable control as the number of approved pesticides diminishes and the resistance of insects and pathogens increases the chemical control of pests is declining in its effectiveness also as concern for the natural environment grows pesticides are no longer blindly accepted by everyone many growers share the concern of nonhorticulturists about the excessive indiscriminate use of pesticides in the past integrated pest management in greenhouses uses temperature and humidity control resistant varieties screens and other entry barriers monitoring devices predatory insects and pesticides to keep pest problems below an economic damage level pesticides are applied only when the pest is most vulnerable and then only where needed they are not necessarily broadcast through the entire greenhouse ipm is costly in terms of the time required to monitor insect and disease development within a crop as well as the expense of the predatory inoculum both costs are ongoing greenhouse crops may require careful methodical inspection twice each week that can include looking under leaves andor lifting the pots of sampled plants to find insects in their hiding places yellow sticky cards placed at regular intervals throughout the crop can help the grower survey the type of insects present in the greenhouse and their stages of development figure 2017 the cards are changed weekly all data concerning the type and number of insects are recorded along with observations of disease symptoms and the areas where the pests are located within the crop such data permit the grower to select the best and most costeffective means of control while targeting the areas of the crop where it should be applied to incorporate fully a program of ipm in a greenhouse necessitates the following elimination of weeds throughout the greenhouse a program of sanitation throughout the structure to include bench andor container pasteurization thorough inspection of all plant materials before bringing them into the greenhouse screening of all vents doors and other openings to the outdoors regular ongoing scouting to identify quantify and record the presence and location of pests within the crop control of the greenhouse environment to favor the crop rather than the pests application of the principles of control to include biological control methods that can reduce the amount and frequency of chemical pesticide application integrated pest management requires a heavy commitment of time in monitoring the crop and the recurring expense of purchasing and releasing beneficial predators into the greenhouse environment however the savings in pesticide costs and the reduced occurrence of pesticide resistance and chemical injury to crops can offset that expense,greenhouse pest control is vital due to conditions that favor pests high humidity temperature and plant density effective pest management combines four principles exclusion preventing pests by using pestfree plant materials and screens eradication removing pests with methods like soil pasteurization destroying infected plants and applying pesticides protection placing barriers like screens and preemptive pesticides between crops and pests resistance using pestresistant plant varieties to naturally curb infestations pests enter through air plants soil and even greenhouse workers control is challenging as pests often develop resistance to pesticides and can evade certain treatments at specific life stages common pesticide applications include sprays systemics dusts aerosols foggers and misters all requiring careful handling and timing for safety and effectiveness integrated pest management ipm reduces reliance on pesticides by combining pest monitoring climate control resistant plant varieties physical barriers and natural predators ipm requires regular inspections and data recording on pest types and locations to apply targeted treatments this method is timeintensive but helps decrease chemical use reduces costs and limits pesticide resistance promoting a safer more sustainable approach to pest control
nursery production techniques container versus field nurseries nursery plants are produced in specialized production facilities under controlled monitored conditions to maximize their rate of growth and standardize the quality of the harvested products the product may be young plants that will be grown on by another nursery propagative materials such as grafts or liners rooted unbranched plants that will be grown to a larger size before sale are examples of such young plants the harvested product may also be plants ready for placement into landscape settings by landscape contractors or homeowners sizes of such plants can range from partially grown to fully mature it is in the methods used to produce this great variety of plant products that container nurseries and field nurseries differ field nurseries are similar to crop farms plants are grown directly in the soil these nurseries require sites with rich welldrained soil few rocks a reliable and adequate fresh water supply and proximity to transportation usually a highway field nurseries traditionally produce trees and shrubs that require from one to ten years to reach the intended size for harvest once installed in the field plants are seldom moved prior to harvest therefore field nursery growers must make careful decisions about spacing between plants and between rows in order to make efficient use of the land and allow field equipment to reach the plants during their production years field nurseries are vulnerable to the uncertainties of nature care or harvesting of the crop can be brought to a costly halt when excessive rainfall renders the fields too wet for working also due to the large acreages involved winter injury and rodent deer and rabbit damage can be greater than in closed production facilities container nurseries do not require fertile field sites they do need level locations and may be surfaced with concrete asphalt or crushed stone like field nurseries container production facilities need a good water supply and access to their markets many of the same plants grown in field nurseries are adaptable to container production however some evergreens grow better under field conditions and many deciduous shrubs can be produced faster and less expensively in the field usually plants produced in containers are kept in production for only one or two years and seldom longer than four years because containergrown plants have their root systems intact and suffer less from transplant shock their acceptance in the marketplace is good current trends suggest that even higher percentages of nursery plants will be produced in containers in the future crop selection the choice of plants for nursery production is governed by several factors market demand production requirements and production capabilities market demand is the driving force that dictates what plant species will sell by whom they are sought what sizes are desired by the purchasers and what quantities of each species and size will be required plants headed for garden centers and other retail outlets for homeowner purchase are often smaller than plants used by landscape contractors nurseries frequently specialize in the production of plants for one type of market rather than trying to serve them all production requirements are simplified when the grower limits the choice of plant species to those having similar propagation methods nutrient and water needs pest control requirements light needs and tolerances spacing and harvest methods such simplicity and specialization saves time and avoids the costs required to produce a more diverse less homogeneous array of species production capabilities can be developed to parallel the requirements for crop production only facilities tools and equipment required for the crops being produced need to be purchased capital is not tied up in expensive machinery or buildings that are required only infrequently or for the production of a species marketed in small quantities or that return small profits there are limits to the simplification of crop choices however one reason is the public interest in new varieties of plants that is increasing the demand for a wider array of plant species in the marketplace another limit is the danger of great financial loss to the nursery grower who grows only a few species a severe insect or disease infection or environmental calamity can wipe out years of effort and investment almost overnight a change in market demand can be almost as disastrous in nursery production as in all areas of agricultural production monocultures should be avoided determining the number of plants to grow nursery plants are costly to produce each plant represents an investment of labor and materials as well as heat water and other cultural expenses growers must determine the total number of plants needed in the size required at the time of harvest for some growers the harvested crop is ready to be planted in homeowners yards for other growers the harvested crop is young grafts or liners that will be further grown by another nursery that has chosen not to do its own propagating profits are lost when an excess of plants is produced and cannot be sold they are also lost when too few plants are ready when needed growers attempt to anticipate and allow for losses due to mortality during production failure to meet grading standards and replacements required for buyer rejections the number of plants grown is calculated by working backward from the desired harvest quota the technique is adaptable to all phases of nursery production regardless of whether the nursery specializes in propagation wholesale field production or container production the formula is a simple one number of plants necessary to start the production quota the estimated return percentage where the estimated return percentage 100the percent mortality example 1 if a production quota representing 100 percent of the crop required 5000 trees for a landscape installation on a certain date and the landscape contractor traditionally rejected 10 percent of the plants on first inspection insisting on replacements the nursery grower would calculate the number of plants to be grown to harvest size as follows number of trees to be grown 5000 trees 100 10 5000 trees 90 5556 trees example 2 to calculate the number of young trees to plant in the field several years in advance of the harvest the grower first estimates at 15 percent the percentage of loss due to insects diseases rodents equipment injury or environmental damage the formula is then applied again using 5556 trees as the production quota number of saplings to install in the field 5556 trees 100 15 5556 trees 85 6537 trees in a similar manner the grower could work backward to calculate the number of field liners needed to produce the saplings then the number of seedlings or grafts required to produce the liners media consideration for nursery crops a review of chapter 3 will highlight basic information about soil which is central to the production of nursery stock as in other areas of agricultural plant production the composition of the soil or even the decision to use soilless media in place of soil is determined by criteria such as the type of crop being grown the stage of growth at the time of harvest the cultural techniques being used the methods of harvest and whether the harvested plant will be bare rooted or balled and burlapped nursery soils need a structure that promotes nutrient availability to the plants and a proper air and water relationship they must drain well while simultaneously retaining the moisture needed for growth the soil ph should be between 500 and 72 for most nursery crops ericaceous plants are sometimes an exception requiring a lower ph for optimum growth soils for field production of woody nursery plants should have these characteristics and also be free of noxious difficult to eradicate weeds insect pests pathogenic inoculum or nematodes the herbicide history of a field should also be known before planting with nursery stock to ensure that a prior crops herbicide is not latent in the soil waiting to damage the new nursery crop also field soil used for nursery crops should be high in organic material good soil fertility is also desirable as long as it is not too acidic or basic which can tie up micronutrients containergrown nursery stock also needs media with the properties already described in addition due to space limitations of containers the media must be heavy enough to anchor the plant and prevent container tipping have a high cation exchange capacity provide desired levels of nitrogen throughout the growing season and retain the moisture needed for optimal plant growth porosity of the medium is of great importance in container plant production porosity is the size of spaces between the particles that comprise the medium it determines how much water and air remain in the root environment after the container has been watered and allowed to drain large pores hold the air within the medium smaller pores hold the water within the medium shallow containers tend to hold a greater percentage of water following irrigation and drainage than do deeper containers whereas deeper containers usually have good aeration but less water retention capacity these differences can be partially compensated for by incorporating materials into the media of shallow containers to improve the aeration porosity materials such as sand perlite turface calcined clay and various wood barks are commonly mixed with finetextured media for that purpose container media must be readily available in the amounts needed when they are needed accordingly the media must be either commercial mixes or easily prepared locally they must also be inexpensive easy to handle and affordable to transport pest free blendable with other additives and stable over time allowing them to be stored without concern for changes in their chemical or physical characteristics the artificial media described in chapter 14 are commonly used for nursery crops the university of california and the cornell mixes may be used in unaltered forms or with additives to improve aeration porosity other container media used include aged and composted hardwood or softwood barks hardwood barks combined with sand and with ammonium nitrate for added nitrogen and elemental sulfur and iron sulfate to stabilize the ph is a common mix,nursery production techniques support plant growth in controlled settings with two main types field nurseries and container nurseries field nurseries operate like traditional farms growing plants directly in soil over several years 110 years these nurseries require nutrientrich welldrained soil a reliable water source and easy transport access they produce larger plants like trees and shrubs though they face natural risks like weather and wildlife damage and must carefully plan spacing and crop rotation container nurseries in contrast grow plants in individual containers on level often paved areas this setup allows precise root management and results in less transplant shock as plants retain their root systems container nurseries produce smaller fastergrowing plants 14 years and offer more flexibility in crop placement and market responsiveness crop selection balances market demand efficient production and plantspecific needs eg water nutrient and light requirements the nursery mediumwhether soil or soillessmust offer optimal porosity air and water balance and be pestfree with soil ph typically between 50 and 72 for healthy growth avoiding monocultures reduces risks of pests diseases and financial loss from market fluctuations ensuring longterm nursery viability
layouts for field production nursery production fields are not all planted in exactly the same way the grower usually considers a number of factors that determine how each field will be laid out 1 eliminating opportunities for erosion 2 using the land as efficiently as possible 3 grouping together plants with similar requirements for cultivation but possibly different harvesting schedules 4 making cultivation and harvest as easy as possible 5 knowing the length of time the crops will be in the field and the size they will attain 6 knowing whether the field will be harvested all at one time or over a period of several seasons the simplest layout for a nursery is a single species planted in sidebyside rows on level land figure 211 erosion is minimal and cultivation equipment can pass easily down the rows and across perpendicular to the rows between the plants harvesting is just as simple when this layout is used making it ideal for barerooting trees and shrubs partial or selective harvesting can also be accomplished by digging plants in a diagonal pattern across the field the open space remaining allows further growth by the plants that remain sidebyside rows can also be used on rolling land with the rows oriented to follow the contours of the slope and thereby minimize erosion crosscultivation is seldom possible on slopes because of the soil erosion it would encourage also total harvesting is not wise some plants should always be left to hold the soil until replacement plants can become established another variation of row planting is the staggered or offset layout figure 212 plants in alternate rows are not set directly opposite those in adjacent rows but in a staggered pattern similar to the fives on dice crosscultivation is not possible with this arrangement harvesting is by rows not diagonally every other row can be harvested the first year and either all remaining rows or every other remaining row harvested in the second year all plants would be cleared by the end of the third year as rows are cleared the soil can be conditioned and planted again or a cover crop seeded to hold the soil cover crops are discussed later in the chapter when space is at a premium narrower aisles can be left between alternate rows figure 213 this permits large equipment to be moved into the field while only slightly increasing the difficulty of cultivating and harvesting mixing species within a single production field adds some complications but is not uncommon first the species must have the same soil and moisture requirements second if shading or winter protection is required it must benefit all the plants finally if the plants are of different sizes or on differing harvest schedules crosscultivation may be impossible species are often mixed between rows to combine fastgrowing and slowgrowing species the first for quick sale and cash turnover the latter for future sale figure 214 maintaining nursery crops in some ways maintaining nursery crops is similar to maintaining floriculture crops the major distinctions are in the magnitude of the operations and the degree of grower control watering fertilizing and controlling pests in the greenhouse are almost totally under the growers control and have little impact outside the operation with nursery production the leaching and runoff of surface and irrigation water fertilizers and pesticides have the potential to affect the environment of people far beyond the nurserys property lines consequently full consideration must be given not only to what is applied but also to where it goes after application irrigation both field and container nurseries receive the natural irrigation of rainfall and supplemental irrigation controlled by the grower provision must be made for a reliable source of water such as an irrigation pond deep well or municipal water supply use of a municipal water supply can add greatly to the cost of production following application the runoff water must be absorbed on site or diverted into municipal storm sewers or nearby streams water that is not absorbed on site must be free of toxic waste excessive fertilizer salts and other nonbiodegradable materials excess irrigation water is often collected in a holding pond and used again to water container crops thereby minimizing the amount of water that leaves the nursery where soluble salt levels are too high the runoff water can be diluted with other water until a safe salt level is attained a holding pond will permit some heavy particulate materials to settle out before the water is reused in other situations leach fields may be necessary to remove undesirable materials before the water is reused or permitted to escape into streams or public systems regulations differ among communities and the prospective nursery grower should consult local water authorities while the nursery is still in the planning stages the authorities can offer suggestions on how the local water quality standards can be met most efficiently the assistance should be sought not avoided by nursery growers in a few regions of the united states the local water is too alkaline for direct use on nursery crops the soluble salts in the water would quickly harm the plants and irrigation equipment would plug up almost as quickly therefore settling ponds are often needed to permit precipitation of the salts before the water is used on the plants in extreme situations the water must be distilled before it is suitable for use supplemental irrigation systems the delivery system for supplemental irrigation of nursery crops may be permanent semiportable or portable the choice of system is usually determined by the frequency and duration of its use where the same species are grown repeatedly and the amount of rainfall is predictable a choice is made easily arid regions are likely to require permanent systems due to the need for regular irrigation nurseries in temperate or subtropical areas may receive enough rainfall to maintain healthy field production and only need supplemental water for container areas or newly transplanted field crops the three degrees of permanency can be compared as follows 1 permanent irrigation system the power source is either an electric or a diesel engine it is permanently installed at the site the pump is also permanently installed and is usually either a deepwell turbine or a horizontal centrifugal one the deepwell turbine is used when water must be lifted to a height of twenty feet or more the system must be near the water supply and on a solid and level base the main and lateral water lines are stationary and below ground deep enough to permit crop cultivation above them the lines are constructed of concrete or pvc piping the system is the most expensive to install but least timeconsuming to operate 2 semiportable irrigation system the power source may be an electric or a diesel engine it is permanently installed at the site the pump is also permanently installed and is usually either a deepwell turbine or a horizontal centrifugal one the system must be near the water supply and on a solid level base the main water lines are stationary and below ground with surface couplers for the attachment of portable lateral lines the main lines are constructed of concrete or pvc piping the lateral lines are usually of pvc the system is less expensive to install but more timeconsuming to operate than a permanent system 3 portable irrigation system the power source is usually a gasoline engine transported to the site on a flatbed truck or a pto power takeoff shaft on a tractor the pump is transported on a truck or cart with the power source all water lines are portable and lightweight they are not buried and are constructed of either pvc or aluminum figure 215 the system is the least expensive to install but most timeconsuming to operate as the irrigation water leaves the pump and water lines it is distributed to the crop through sprinkler heads container nurseries use overhead sprinklers or a pvc tube spaghetti system described in chapter 20 the sprinkler systems are more wasteful of water than the tube system which applies water directly to each container and not in between either method requires occasional handwatering in one case some plants are not reached fully by the sprinklers in the other case the thin pvc tubes occasionally become plugged the use of filters in the water lines can reduce the frequency of plugging some growers also insert a fiber mulch ring around each containerized plant to retain moisture and discourage weeds field production areas may apply supplemental irrigation from rotating sprinklers coupled to the lateral water lines figure 216 portable systems may make use of a traveling sprinkler that carries its own water supply and dispenses it rapidly as it is pulled down the nursery rows neither system should apply the water faster than the field soil can absorb it in production fields where crops are widely spaced as with large trees or highvalue specimen plants supplemental water may be applied through trickle irrigation figure 217 the lowpressure tube system reduces the waste and expense of watering expanses of field where the moisture is not needed instead water is applied slowly to the root zone of each plant that allows for both optimum growth and cost efficiency trickle systems require a timer to turn on the irrigation water each day when the plants are most in need of it they also require a flow regulator and pressurecompensating emitters to control the rate of water delivery to each plant fertilization nursery plants usually require fertilization to promote healthy growth and bring the plant to the harvest stage as rapidly as possible due to the variety of sizes and production methods it is predictable that the methods of fertilization will vary as is the case with other cultural procedures grouping together plant species that have similar fertilizer requirements will make the fertilizer application process easier for the grower small plants growing in ground beds usually are fertilized once a year typical rates of application are needled evergreens 4 lb per 1000 sq ft broadleaved evergreens 3 lb per 1000 sq ft deciduous shrubs 5 lb per 1000 sq ft small plants growing in containers need more frequent fertilization during the growing season because of the limited amount of media around the roots these plants lack the nutrient reserve that is available in ground beds containergrown crops may be fertilized with dry slowrelease fertilizers or during irrigation with the fertilizer injector systems described in chapter 20 in production fields where crops are widely spaced as with large trees or highvalue specimen plants supplemental water may be applied through trickle irrigation figure 217 the lowpressure tube system reduces the waste and expense of watering expanses of field where the moisture is not needed instead water is applied slowly to the root zone of each plant that allows for both optimum growth and cost efficiency trickle systems require a timer to turn on the irrigation water each day when the plants are most in need of it they also require a flow regulator and pressurecompensating emitters to control the rate of water delivery to each plant,nursery production fields are arranged to maximize efficiency manage erosion and simplify cultivation common layouts include singlespecies sidebyside rows ideal for level land and easy harvesting as well as staggered rows that allow phased harvesting over seasons on sloped land rows are aligned with the lands contours to reduce erosion mixed species layouts are also possible if plants share soil and water requirements though this limits crosscultivation maintaining nursery crops involves controlling irrigation fertilization and pest management while considering environmental impact water sources like ponds wells or municipal supplies provide supplemental irrigation using systems that vary in permanencypermanent systems are most efficient but costly while portable systems are less expensive but require more setup delivery methods include overhead sprinklers for wide coverage trickle irrigation for targeted rootzone watering and traveling sprinklers for flexible irrigation needs fertilization depends on plant type and setup ground beds need annual applications with specific rates for evergreens and shrubs while container plants require more frequent fertilization due to limited soil volume techniques like slowrelease fertilizers or fertigation during irrigation ensure steady growth while balancing resource use and environmental impact
fertilization nursery plants usually require fertilization to promote healthy growth and bring the plant to the harvest stage as rapidly as possible due to the variety of sizes and production methods it is predictable that the methods of fertilization will vary as is the case with other cultural procedures grouping together plant species that have similar fertilizer requirements will make the fertilizer application process easier for the grower small plants growing in ground beds usually are fertilized once a year typical rates of application are needled evergreens 4 lb per 1000 sq ft broadleaved evergreens 3 lb per 1000 sq ft deciduous shrubs 5 lb per 1000 sq ft small plants growing in containers need more frequent fertilization during the growing season because of the limited amount of media around the roots these plants lack the nutrient reserve that is available in ground beds containergrown crops may be fertilized with dry slowrelease fertilizers or during irrigation with the fertilizer injector systems described in chapter 20 plants growing in the field usually have dry lowanalysis fertilizer or manure incorporated into the soil before planting after planting nitrogen fertilizers are usually added annually typical rates of nitrogen application for field production include needled evergreens 175 lb per acre broadleaved evergreens 125 lb per acre deciduous trees and shrubs 225 lb per acre actual rates are dependent on the crop the soil type and the length of growing season rather than applying all of the fertilizer at once it is usually applied in two or three applications a spring and early fall or a spring early summer and early fall application schedule allows the most efficient use of the fertilizer by minimizing nutrient loss due to leaching further cost efficiency is made possible by applying the fertilizer as side dressing applied along the side of the rows rather than broadcasting it over the entire field side dress applications are also safer for the offsite environment since the potential for chemical runoff is lessened regardless of how the fertilizer is applied all applications of nutrients should be discontinued with the approach of fall to allow the stock to hardenoff before winter sets in weed and pest control weeds insects and diseases are as inevitable with nursery crops as with any other plants production of a monoculture with close spacing high fertility and ample irrigation ensures an assortment of prolific pests all the principles of pest control discussed in chapters 6 and 20 are applicable to nursery production but there are some differences in the ways they are applied the differences are due to the openness of the nursery production area and the length of time the crop is under production for example soil pasteurization is helpful in nursery container production but far less effective than in greenhouse production the soil being outdoors becomes contaminated much more quickly still the quantity of weed seeds insect larvae and pathogenic inoculum is reduced initially giving the crop a better chance of becoming established so pasteurization can be helpful weeds are also much more troublesome for the nursery grower than for the greenhouse grower their seeds can persist in the nursery field for many years with a fresh crop waiting to germinate each time the soil is turned over in addition to their competition with the desired plants which has been described weeds can reduce plants sales appeal when they appear in the same container insects and diseases are controlled by using pestfree propagative stock by growing plants in regions of the country where their pests are not as common by selecting resistant varieties for growth by preventing the growth of weeds that can harbor the pests by cleaning up crop debris that can serve as sources of inoculum and by spraying or dusting with chemical protectants and eradicants where chemical pesticides are required the states college of agriculture can provide listings of effective products approved for use on specified crops as noted elsewhere growers should take care to mix only the quantity of pesticide that can be applied in a single spraying and avoid spraying or dusting on windy days if the field is sloped runoff can also be a hazard so the product should not be applied to the point of dripping weeds can be controlled with preemergence herbicides applied in the autumn and early spring later in the spring postemergence products can keep the nursery free of broadleaved weeds the herbicides are usually applied in granular form as a side dressing many of the products are specific against certain plants they cannot be applied universally since certain crops could be harmed the product labels list the plants that can be treated safely as well as the weeds controlled by the chemical some of the herbicides require mixing into the soil to become active others are dissolved by rainwater or artificial irrigation and do not require cultivation some are reduced in effectiveness if the soil is disturbed so mechanical cultivation must be avoided during crop production some pests bother nursery crops more than floriculture crops these include rodents rabbits and deer rodents can be controlled though seldom eliminated with poisoned bait placed throughout the nursery rabbits can be discouraged with repellants sprayed onto the base of plants or with plastic coils wrapped around the trunks of young trees deer are much more difficult to control although some benefit is claimed for repellants fencing the nursery can prevent deer from winter browsing in the production fields integrated pest management is possible with nursery crop production but it is effective only if every employee who works with the crops understands and implements it in a timely manner scouting of the crops on a regular frequent basis is essential to detect the presence of insects pathogens noxious weeds or animal injury immediate response to the scouting report is then mandatory if the pest is to be contained control procedures must be applied as soon as the scouting report is filed in so doing the pest can often be controlled without the need for more expensive control practices that would be required if the problem were permitted to spread labeling nursery crops growers must label their nursery crops in a standardized manner that is easily understood by all employees production scheduling inventory control and the filling of orders depend on accurate knowledge of where each species is growing and how many are available for sale or in a particular stage of production should a label be destroyed the very identity of certain lookalike cultivars could be lost permanently therefore labels of nursery stock must be durable as well as correctly placed figure 218 two methods of labeling are commonly used the method used for container stock and equally effective for many field nurseries places the label in front of the first plant of that cultivar and pertains to all plants to the rear and right of that label until the next label is reached figure 219 the other method is used almost solely for large field nurseries and follows the direction of planting with a new label inserted into the ground each time the cultivar changes when mechanical planters are used and more than one row is planted simultaneously the label changeover becomes a bit more complex figures 2110 and 2111 mixing the species in alternate rows requires that each row be labeled field pruning nursery stock there are few similarities between landscape pruning described in chapters 11 and 12 and the pruning of nursery plants in production the objectives of landscape pruning are to improve the health or appearance of the plant or to limit its growth the objective of nursery field pruning is to promote and direct branching and create a fuller plant as quickly as possible fullness adds measurably to the sales appeal of the plant shade and specimen trees and certain specialized plants such as fruit trees require individual attention and handpruning during production plants grown in mass quantities for the seasonal market cannot be given such timeconsuming and costly attention trees require more time to shape and develop than do shrubs trunk development and crown shaping are both of importance to develop straight trunks with smooth bark and strong scaffold limbs with wide crotch junctions requires individual attention at least once during each year of field growth evergreen trees must have their candles the new growth pinched in the spring before growth fully expands if the developing trees are to benefit by the pruning if the trees are intended to be cut for christmas sales the only objective is to add fullness if the trees are intended for landscape use the pruning can direct growth to fill in holes in the plant remove conflicting branches and add fullness evergreen shrubs are sheared in the early spring before their annual flush of growth begins the shearing promotes lateral branching of the shoots and creates a fuller plant if the shrubs have a pyramid or columnar form care must be taken to respect their natural shape and not cut off the lead shoots if the shrubs are rounded or spreading forms the shearing is directed to heading back the lateral branches deciduous shrubs particularly those that are to be barerooted at harvest often get the least individual attention because they bring the least return at the market they are commonly pruned with a sharp cutting bar driven down the nursery row removing about a third of the previous seasons growth in the process root pruning using an underground blade in a manner similar to that of the cutting bar just described nursery growers prune back the root systems of shrubs and young trees done in the fall after the plants have ceased their active growth for the year the pruning technique promotes a compact root system such a root system gives the plants a better chance of surviving their eventual harvesting handling and transplanting without root pruning most of the fibrous nutrient and waterabsorbing roots would be lost at the time of harvest and nursery plants would have little more chance of survival than plants collected from the woods for larger trees and shrubs the sickle bar technique is inadequate instead several months to a year in advance of the harvest a trench must be dug around each plant just outside of what will be the soil ball at the time of harvest the trench should be at least the width of a spade and as deep as the soil ball will be the trench is then backfilled with sand this process cuts the lateral roots of the plant and encourages new ones to develop within the soil ball the sand discourages root growth out of the ball containerized nursery plants do not require root pruning since the entire system is intact within the container if kept too long in the container the plants may send roots out through the drainage holes and into the soil of their holding area making it hard to lift them this can be discouraged by spreading a layer of heavy black plastic beneath the containers the plastic also discourages weeds from growing,nursery plants require targeted fertilization to promote growth with techniques varying by plant size and growth setting plants in ground beds receive annual fertilizer typically with needled evergreens getting 4 lbs per 1000 sq ft broadleaved evergreens 3 lbs and deciduous shrubs 5 lbs per 1000 sq ft for container plants which lack the nutrient reserves of ground beds frequent fertilization with slowrelease products or through fertigation ensures balanced growth in fieldgrown plants nitrogen fertilizers are often incorporated in spring early summer and fall for optimal nutrient use and sidedressing application prevents environmental runoff weed and pest control are essential to prevent competition and damage in nursery environments unlike greenhouses nursery fields are prone to weeds and pests that thrive in open nutrientrich conditions weed control involves preemergence and postemergence herbicides that target specific species often applied in granular form as a side dressing pest management includes ipm practices like scouting resistant varieties and the careful use of chemical protectants to manage pests while minimizing environmental impact rodent rabbit and deer issues are managed through repellants physical barriers and regular monitoring to maintain healthy nursery stock
harvesting nursery crops like any other product must be made ready for sale before the time they are sought by the customer since the greatest sale of nursery plants occurs in the spring most plants are dug barerooted or balledandburlapped graded and prepared for sale in the fall in regions of the country where spring arrives late and the ground freezes deep it is impossible to dig enough material in the spring fall digging also allows the nursery workers to grade prune bundle and package the stock throughout the winter months if an entire row of shrubs is to be dug and barerooted a forked ushaped blade pulled by a tractor may be used as it lifts the plants from the ground nursery workers shake off the soil and place the plants on a truck the plants are taken to shaded storage areas where the roots are covered with soil or other materials to prevent drying until they can be graded and bundled plants that are to be balledandburlapped may be dug by rows or by a pattern that harvests some plants while leaving others for a later time mechanized tree and shrub spades are used by some nurseries to dig plants for burlapping but the majority are dug by hand squares of burlap large enough to cover the ball are available precut or can be cut off a roll burlap is also available in a treated rotresistant or untreated form treated burlap is more expensive but is needed if the plants are to be stored unplanted for a while untreated burlap can be used when the plants are going to be transplanted soon after harvest for best sales appeal the soil ball should be nicely rounded not flat or misshapen it should contain enough roots to ensure survival of the plant yet not be unnecessarily heavy figure 2112 the burlap can be secured with twine or with pinning nails larger plant balls can be secured using the technique of drumlacing in which twine is wound around the ball and then laced in a zigzag pattern figure 2113 all balledandburlapped plants should be lifted and carried by the soil ball not by the branches figure 2114 large plants can be moved with a forklift tractor crane or ball cart the ball should be handled carefully to prevent it from breaking apart after burlapping the plants can be bedded or heeled in with sawdust peat moss or shavings to keep the roots and soil ball moist until grading and sale in warm climates some harvested plants may require special care for example cacti need a week for the roots to airdry and heal in the southeast tropical plants grown for interior use require carefully controlled light reduction to prepare them for transplanting in recent years nursery growers have introduced several variations on the traditional balled and burlapped plant wire baskets lined with nontreated burlap accept the harvested plants soil balls directly from the field the baskets are then tightened around the balls with soil added if necessary to create the roundness desired for marketing appeal figure 2115 containerized plants harvested from the field are also commonly available today immediately following digging the plant balls are set into containers then held for several weeks while the root system regenerates this method of harvest can be done almost any time the weather permits digging nursery stock is graded in accordance with the american standards for nursery stock developed and published by the american nursery and landscape association anla in washington dc containerized plants require little preparation for sale other than cleaning weeds from the containers grading and perhaps tagging them with names plant patent numbers or other information if a fiber mulch ring has been used for moisture retention or weed control it should be removed before sale overwintering in northern climates field grown nursery plants that remain unsold after harvest must be prepared to survive the winter if they are to be suitable for sale the following spring the greatest threat to their survival is the vulnerability of their root systems to freezing that results from their being above ground the same danger exists for containerized plants neither root system has the insulation protection that plants have while growing in the field to protect the root systems of container plants and bb stock nursery growers use the following techniques heelingin the plants are set into bins or piles of loose material such as wood shavings or saw dust deep enough to cover the root ball or containers to a depth that affords the needed insulation overwintering houses the plants are placed into white polyethylene covered houses made as animal proof as possible there they are protected from temperature extremes and drying winds on abnormally warm days the houses must be vented so that the plants do not break dormancy in high snow areas the houses must be strong enough to support the predictable snow loads figure 2116 bordering pots container plants are grouped as close together as possible then surrounded by one or more rows of unplanted containers filled with soil the border of pots serves as a buffer against the wind along with the close spacing they help to insulate against the temperature extremes potinpot production large empty pots are buried in the ground up to their lips container plants in slightly smaller pots are set inside the larger ones this technique affords the root systems the same protection as field grown plants figure 2117 if kept in the field pots during the summer the roots may suffer from excessive heat so this is not suitable for yearround production in every region of the country cover crops and crop rotation since a nursery crop is only as good as the soil it is grown in it is vital that nursery fields be stabilized and reconditioned after each crop is harvested root balls remove significant quantities of soil from fields including valuable top soil where fields are completely cleared by a harvest erosion and further soil loss become dangers the first priority of a nursery operator must be to prevent soil erosion the second priority is to rebuild the soil before the next crop of nursery plants is set out a cover crop is a rapidly growing nonnursery crop used to stabilize the soil and prevent erosion it may cover an entire field or only an area where insufficient nursery crops remain to hold the soil green manure is a crop that is rotated in the field with nursery crops it too deters erosion but also improves the structure of the soil fixes nitrogen and adds valuable organic matter the deeper the roots of the cover and green manure crops the greater their benefit to the soil it is possible for one species or mix of species to function as both a cover crop and a green manure cover crops are frequently planted in the fall after the harvest sometimes they are planted between the rows of nursery plants when harvesting is done over a period of several years cover crops are rototilled or plowed under each spring returning organic matter to the soil the seeding of another cover crop may then follow if the field is not planted right away green manure crops are usually seeded in the spring and grown through the summer then turned under before they develop seeds that could create weed problems for the nursery crop that is to follow a winter cover crop may then be seeded to protect the soil from erosion until planting in the spring plants commonly used as cover crops or green manure include buckwheat sudan grass oats rye field corn annual ryegrass soybeans alfalfa clover and hybrid sudansorghum grass animal manures are also valuable soil conditioners and can be plowed under at the same time as cover and green manure crops they can be obtained in quantity from nearby farms and slaughter houses,in nursery production plants are harvested and prepared for sale often during fall to meet the high demand of spring harvested plants are dug up either barerooted or balledandburlapped balled plants are wrapped in burlap sometimes using wire baskets to protect the root ball until transplanting this burlapping ensures a rounded soil ball that contains enough roots for plant survival but isnt overly heavy plants are then carefully stored to prevent drying with root protection from light exposure and drying for unsold nursery plants in northern climates overwintering is crucial to protect roots from freezing techniques include heelingin where plants are placed in wood shavings using overwintering houses for controlled temperature and ventilation bordering pots which insulate root systems with surrounding containers and potinpot production providing ground insulation for container plants each technique minimizes temperature fluctuations that could break dormancy or damage roots soil management is also essential for nursery sustainability after each crop cover crops like rye or clover are planted to prevent erosion improve soil structure and add organic matter these crops stabilize soil and when tilled under return nutrients thereby enhancing field quality for future nursery crops

typewriters filing cabinets mimeograph machines and a computer the size of a refrigerator that hardly anyone knew how to use there is now something strikingly different fewer people operating fewer machines with expanded capabilities have brought a new look to the office workplace the computer is now the central feature of every office and most desktops the benefits and limitations like so many advances that preceded it the computer age has offered many benefits with a few accompanying drawbacks modern computers are much smaller than their first generation ancestors and have many more capabilities they can process and store vast amounts of data in a variety of forms they can accelerate calculations project the effects of changes and even predict the changes they can allow instant recall of historical data react to sensors correct spelling and grammar in multiple languages create graphic illustrations from numerical data activate environmental systems turn drawings into electronic impulses and restructure them as drawings in far distant places while doing all of these things computers never show the slightest sign of fatigue bad temper or stress they dont form labor unions they dont go on strike and they dont need vacations holidays or even coffee breaks the most common uses of the computer most businesses of america and the developed nations have embraced computer technology and are quick to accept and incorporate each new advancement the companies of the green industry are no different the most common software programs are of three types 1 word processing 2 numerical calculations and 3 graphic visualization in addition the explosive growth of the internet gives companies in the most remote locations access to the nation and the world current uses of the computer in the offices of american horticulture firms include correspondence customer accounts accounts payable payroll taxes mailing lists and labels inventory records accounts receivable billing sales analysis email office newsletters and promotional mailings to customers beyond the office industryspecific operations include greenhouse environmental control soil and media

appearance with varied font styles sizes and even colors form letters can be personalized with the recipients name and other specifics that increase the probability of it being read rather than discarded spelling errors and incorrect grammar are minimized as software becomes increasingly userfriendly and responsive to human frailties the word processor has also replaced the filing cabinet with compact discs superceding manila folders as the place to store client and employee records when linked to an office email system the word processor can send simultaneous and paperless memos or copies to a number of people in different offices buildings and cities chapter 24 deals with the use of the word processor in business communications numerical calculations with the capability of software programs to accomplish mathematical functions prepare spreadsheets and convert numerical data to bar graphs pie charts and other graphic interpretations the office computer can fill many additional roles computers are commonly used to track inventory accounts receivable and payable prepare estimates billings and paychecks maintain time records and prepare tax reports and other financial statements computer technology allows garden centers and nurseries to update their inventories when plants and other materials are purchased one scan by a computerized register generates a printed receipt for the customer and simultaneously deducts the item from the inventory landscapers are able to quantify materials from designs and convert the data into precise bids in a fraction of the time required by conventional measuring and counting methods last minute changes to design specifications can be quickly input and the bid updated less time is required for calculations that in the past were timeconsuming tedious and subject to human error at the same time the accuracy of the calculations has probably improved since the computers insistence on certain data input has compelled companies to keep close track of labor hours material costs overhead costs and equipment usage early software estimating and inventory programs were directed at a generic business market more recently a number of specialized programs have reached the market that specifically target the nursery landscape lawn care irrigation or florist companies they range in sophistication and in their usefulness to the user it seems to be generally agreed by industry practitioners that the best software is that which is sufficiently complex to meet their needs and which can be customized to fit their individual business they do not want to modify the business to conform to inflexible software in the short span of time that the green industry has been using commercially developed estimating inventory and other office practice software numerous products have fallen in and out of favor there are two reasons that most companies change from one program to another either they find a new program that is a better fit with the way they do business or they outgrow the capabilities of their current software to track the financial activity of their expanding business one of the most successful niches developed by enterprising software companies has been the creation of specific software for specific companies rather than attempting to customize an existing program for a buyer input devices for numerical calculation programs include a keyboard a scanner and a digitizer figure 261 the digitizer permits direct measurement of lengths areas volumes and perimeters from drawings so it is essential for the conversion of drawn data to numerical equivalents the output device for numerical calculations is usually a printer graphic visualization several types of computer graphic visualization systems enjoy popularity among horticulturists most of which are adaptations of programs developed earlier for other industries cad computeraided design systems are accelerated drafting systems designed to do what centuries of draftsmen have done with their tsquare and pencils computer drafting has increased mainly because of a pcbased cad software program named autocad a registered trademark of autodesk inc due to the necessity for hardware software and user training autocad is an expensive investment for a company it is not ready to use on delivery to the office moreover because it is a general system marketed to a variety of users it requires a third party disciplinespecific software interface to customize it for a specific type of design and drafting there are a growing number of landscape and irrigation designspecific software programs available and more to come however the one most commonly used by landscape architects and landscape designers is landcadd developed by a group of practicing professionals and released commercially in 1984 landcadd is marketed by landcadd inc of franktown colorado since its inception the program has advanced through many generations of revisions and currently offers modular programs that permit a company to purchase only those programs that it needs avoiding the requirement of paying for ones that it will not use at the heart of the software system is the site planning and landscape design module it permits creation of two and threedimensional plan views elevations and perspectives of landscape features and entire sites textures colors enlargements of special areas lettering and a variety of other graphic features are possible when used by a skilled operator the drawings can rival handdrawn plans as the design develops the plant list is automatically created and tabulated designers can select from the symbols that come with the program or develop and add their own to further customize the system figure 262 illustrates a landscape plan developed using landcadd threedimensional drawings of buildings terrain and grading plans are also possible using the systems planning and design module with the rapid growth of irrigation services and the increased number of companies offering them the irrigation design module also enjoys widespread use figure 263 other modules permit material measurement cost estimating and plant selection it warrants repeating that landcadd is but one company now offering these disciplinespecific software programs figure 264 illustrates a drawing done using different software future advances by the competing companies will ensure a free market innovative research and development responsiveness to the needs of the green industry and fair prices to the industry consumers the input device for computerized drawing is usually a mouse or a digitizing tablet and stylus the mouse functions like it does on a word processor that is to roll around the table while the cursor moves about on the screen the tablet and stylus permit the designer to place drawings on the monitors screen in a manner remotely similar to that of the traditional draftsman figure 265 the output device for cad system drawings is usually a plotter figure 266 it provides a print of quality including colored lines while also permitting larger sizes than possible on the printers of conventional word processors video imaging is a computerized technique that superimposes a landscape concept over a photographic image of the undeveloped landscape most commonly used by residential landscape designers to illustrate their proposals for areas around a clients home the designer begins with one or more photographs of the building captured with a conventional camera a digital camera or a video camera one or more selected images of the building are then entered into the systems memory thereafter the image can be brought up on a monitor and the computer used to superimpose color photo images of plants pavings pools lawn walls fences and other landscape elements over the building the system also permits the designer to modify the photo to illustrate the impact of removing existing features changing colors or even remodeling the architecture the resulting image gives customers a full color suggestion of how their landscape will look before it is actually installed it is an excellent sales tool figure 267 there are several good video imaging systems on the market the first and arguably still most popular is the system produced by design imaging group located in holtsville new york video imaging is less a design system and more a graphic technique because it does not create scaled drawings it relies on the eye of the user to create the proper perspective once the graphic image is composed on the monitors screen it can then be reproduced as a color print or as videotape for presentation to a client audience of one or a hundred and one the design imaging system and others are able to interface with cad systems such as landcadd to apply color and realistic surface textures to the line drawings produced by those systems,technology in ornamental horticulture has evolved with computers and software tools transforming many aspects of business operations and design computers now play a central role in data management and automation with programs for word processing numerical calculations and graphic visualization as the most commonly used in horticulture firms office functions word processing replaces typewriters enabling the creation of highquality documents with editable fonts and colors numerical calculations spreadsheets track inventory calculate payroll and maintain financial records with precision and efficiency graphic visualization cad systems like autocad and landcadd enable advanced landscape designs in two or three dimensions facilitating accurate planning and aesthetic design field and environmental control software assists with greenhouse environmental management soil preparation and irrigation design geographic information systems gis help manage environmental data while internet access allows firms to stay updated with supplier prices and market trends specialized applications video imaging enhances landscape design presentation by superimposing landscape concepts on photographs of undeveloped areas offering clients a visual preview ornamental horticulture continues to leverage these innovations for better productivity accuracy and customer satisfaction making technology an indispensable part of modern horticultural practices
other uses of modern technology the development of the technology of today and tomorrow has been either made possible or accelerated by the ongoing evolution of computers the scientific breakthroughs of the space program have ushered in an era of nearly instant communications that link people and companies worldwide researchers have machines apparatus and techniques available for their use that early pioneers in science could have never envisioned growers now press buttons to mix soil rather than lift shovels they let sensors determine when to water rather than sticking their fingers into the soil golf course superintendents consult their onsite weather station to determine the advisability of applying chemicals or preparing work schedules no listing of the ways that computerbased technology is used throughout the green industry could ever be complete or current but consider these several examples as representative the greenhouse industry enlisting the speed and alertness of computers to help grow plants in greenhouses has been made possible by the development of sensory input devices independent of human commands the sensors can detect and monitor temperatures light humidity carbon dioxide wind velocity and direction soluble salt levels ph and many other growthrelated factors the computerized control system does three things 1 sensing the system objectively measures environmental factors using a series of independent sensors the sensors are located both inside and outside the greenhouse range they are not restricted to single locations within a house which makes them a significant improvement over older analog control systems 2 decision making an independent computer monitors the sensors analyzes the data they provide and compares the existing environmental description against the growers programmed instructions 3 taking action the system activates equipment within the greenhouse to implement the decisions made computerized environmental control systems are component systems whose parts are linked together by coaxial cables and computer chips and whose data can be made available to the grower at any time either in graphic displays or in digital or printed form by means of the computer monitor figure 268 illustrates a typical computerized environmental control system in a greenhouse range unlike older greenhouse control systems which are basically reactive systems example the temperature drops below a minimum and the thermostat turns on the heat full force to warm the house computerized systems can be programmed to respond almost continuously to the integrated sensory information the result is a greenhouse environment that remains nearly constant changing more slowly than the reactive systems temperature extremes crop drying and watering humidity levels light conditions and other growth factors adjust gradually the assumption is that this stability results in less traumatic growing conditions and thereby improves plant growth logical though the assumption is researchers are just beginning to evaluate the new technology as computerized production technology continues to develop it can be anticipated that such lags between manufacturer claims and independent confirmation will be common representative greenhouse environmental control system manufacturers are argus controls in canada priva computers inc in the netherlands and wadsworth control systems in arvada colorado it is interesting to note that none of the companies incorporates the word greenhouse in their name probably recognizing and hoping that their computeroperated systems have a more comprehensive adaptability to other and future green industry operations the retail florist industry the green industry business that remains most tied to its handcrafting roots is retail floristry however even it has become hightech in comparison to its recent past while worldwide wire service is not new the method and speed of transmission are as current as the latest telecommunications technology can make them florists across the country and around the world are linked by means of numerous cooperative agreements that enable customers to make a call to their local flower shop and send flowers thousands of miles away for arrival that same day while ftd teleflora and other established wire services still dominate other companies such as sears roebuck 1800 flowers and hallmark stores are now successfully attracting wire orders and transmitting them through their own network of affiliated shops even local business is often given a technical look as the florist while designing an arrangement in the traditional way answers the telephone and speaks with a customer using a headset rather than a handheld receiver so that work is not interrupted the same flower shop may also elect to advertise its services on the internet or link itself with other products or companies that will bring its name before a much greater audience than ever before possible the landscape industry in addition to the uses of the computer as an aid to drawing calculating and preparing graphic presentations the landscape industry has adapted other forms and types of technology for its benefit multipleuse machinery is gradually replacing equipment that could only dig a hole cut a trench or perform other single functions wireless communication systems permit faster easier and more frequent communication between people in the field in the office and on the road somewhere in between customer concerns can receive quicker attention problems can be resolved sooner confusion and errors are reduced industry trade associations are offering expanded services to their members using the interactive capabilities of the internet and email some companies are even able to let customers calculate their own maintenance estimates using interactive web sites whereby the customer enters specific measurements and other data about property from home that is paired with prices preset by the company the result is a doityourself estimate generated by customers that saves the company time particularly the time lost doing estimates that are not accepted while this is not yet widely practiced the potential is there for other types of customercompany interaction more common and gaining in usage are computergenerated estimates that can be done onsite by project directors and others working with handheld systems that can calculate and print out as the customer waits by reducing the turnaround time between a customers query and the companys reply additional business is generated landscape architects are using the data provided by geographic information systems to ascertain the suitability of near and distant sites for varying types of development they are also able to receive and transmit data electronically between their offices and that of associated professionals who are also involved in their projects computer systems can now convert flat plans on a monitor into video walkthroughs of the proposed design the turf industries advances in maintenance equipment efficiency and irrigation technology have made operations more costeffective for lawn care services golf course operators and landscape contractors with the development of a programmable unmanned mower now a reality the potential uses of a machine that grazes like a cow are unclear but interesting to imagine the application of current and near future research has resulted in bioengineered grasses that are more resistant to environmental stress andor require fewer mowings to maintain their desired appearance probabilities and possibilities for the future futuring is always fun fortune tellers have been reading tea leaves for many years hoping to foresee what will happen next the early years of a new century seem to amplify the excitement and the expectations that wonderful new things loom on the horizon it seems safe to say that americans are expecting this country to lead the world into the age of technology as the 21st century has already been dubbed just as we took the lead in science during the 20th century the businesses scientists educators practitioners and customers of the green industry can anticipate further changes in how ornamental horticulture is practiced and presented in the near and distant future the most highprofile changes will probably result from further advances in computer and telecommunication technology faster and easier access to an everexpanding marketplace will give consumers greater choices a customer in boston may choose to order orchids directly from hawaii rather than the local flower shop and get the same quality price and prompt delivery a nursery grower may bypass the local wholesale supplier and order needed supplies directly from their manufacturers sales people may spend more time in facetoface conversations with customers on television monitors than in their offices or shops voice commands may soon replace or at least supplement drawn plans in the offices of landscape designers and architects plant breeders can be expected to respond to increasing environmental concerns with accelerated efforts to produce plants that require less maintenance less fertilization less water and are more resistant to pests and other stress factors the greater movement of people plants and plant products around the world can be expected to bring new pests into regions of the planet that are vulnerable to rapid invasive damage that will introduce new challenges for arborists landscapers and others consolidations and mergers are already occurring throughout the landscape lawn care and arborist industries at least in the short term that can be expected to continue and it may widen to include the florist and nursery industries as well as large regional or national corporate identities are established within the green industry they mirror what is happening nationally in other industries such as property management gaining the advantages of improved purchasing power higher profile advertising stateoftheart technology and easier access to the centers of power where decisions are made such companies offer formidable competition to local independent companies that may offer a comparable or even better product or service but cannot get the attention of the decisionmakers who may not be local the flip side of technology just as the development of automobiles negated the need for buggy makers the use of word processors has sent typewriter manufacturers into bankruptcy the incorporation of new technology into horticulture companies has created some problems the one most common to all types of businesses is the impact on the workforce most upgrades in technology necessitate the retraining of some employees that may or may not involve an expense some technical advances also displace workers or require their replacement with bettereducated workers who expect higher salaries and who may not be easily recruited older workers long in their service and loyalty to a company and knowledgeable of existing technology may resist accepting the new knowledge and techniques new technology excites some people and is perceived as a threat by others as the current and future generations of american horticulturists train to work with the new technology fewer people will remain to perform the laborintensive entry level and field tasks that will still constitute a large portion of the production services performed by green industry companies the employee shortage is already a major concern in all sectors of ornamental horticulture the new technology may herald an era of increased sophistication in the ways horticulturists present their products and services while simultaneously provoking a shortage of personnel to do the work,modern technology especially computers and telecommunications has profoundly transformed the green industry from greenhouses to florists and landscape services in greenhouses advanced sensory devices autonomously monitor and adjust environmental conditions such as temperature light humidity and co creating stable conditions that enhance plant growth unlike traditional reactive systems these computerized controls provide gradual continuous adjustments to environmental changes fostering healthier plants florists now utilize global wire networks for sameday flower delivery while landscapers use technology for realtime project estimates and interactive customer interfaces landscape architects leverage geographic information systems gis to assess site suitability and offer clients video walkthroughs of designs in the turf industry technological advancements have introduced programmable unmanned mowers and bioengineered grasses that require less maintenance and tolerate environmental stress anticipated future developments like voicecommanded landscape designs and direct customersupplier online ordering will likely offer greater convenience and choice however integrating new technologies also brings challenges including the need for specialized training and the risk of worker displacement smaller companies may struggle to compete with larger corporations which can more easily adopt advanced systems and gain market influence this technologydriven shift emphasizes both opportunities for innovation and potential difficulties in workforce adaptation
cells and genomes the surface of our planet is populated by living thingscurious intricately organized chemical factories that take in matter from their surroundings and use these raw materials to generate copies of themselves these living organisms appear extraordinarily diverse what could be more different than a tiger and a piece of seaweed or a bacterium and a tree yet our ancestors knowing nothing of cells or dna saw that all these things had something in common they called that something life marveled at it struggled to define it and despaired of explaining what it was or how it worked in terms that relate to nonliving matter the discoveries of the past century have not diminished the marvelquite the contrary but they have removed the central mystery regarding the nature of life we can now see that all living things are made of cells small membraneenclosed units filled with a concentrated aqueous solution of chemicals and endowed with the extraordinary ability to create copies of themselves by growing and then dividing in two because cells are the fundamental units of life it is to cell biologythe study of the structure function and behavior of cellsthat we must look for answers to the questions of what life is and how it works with a deeper understanding of cells and their evolution we can begin to tackle the grand historical problems of life on earth its mysterious origins its stunning diversity and its invasion of every conceivable habitat indeed as emphasized long ago by the pioneering cell biologist e b wilson the key to every biological problem must finally be sought in the cell for every living organism is or at some time has been a cell despite their apparent diversity living things are fundamentally similar inside the whole of biology is thus a counterpoint between two themes astonishing variety in individual particulars astonishing constancy in fundamental mechanisms in this first chapter we begin by outlining the universal features common to all life on our planet we then survey briefly the diversity of cells and we see how thanks to the common molecular code in which the specifications for all living organisms are written it is possible to read measure and decipher these specifications to help us achieve a coherent understanding of all the forms of life from the smallest to the greatest the universal features of cells on earth it is estimated that there are more than 10 millionperhaps 100 millionliving species on earth today each species is different and each reproduces itself faithfully yielding progeny that belong to the same species the parent organism hands down information specifying in extraordinary detail the characteristics that the offspring shall have this phenomenon of heredity is central to the definition of life it distinguishes life from other processes such as the growth of a crystal or the burning of a candle or the formation of waves on water in which orderly structures are generated but without the same type of link between the peculiarities of parents and the peculiarities of offspring like the candle flame the living organism must consume free energy to create and maintain its organization but life employs the free energy to drive a hugely complex system of chemical processes that are specified by hereditary information most living organisms are single cells others such as ourselves are vast multicellular cities in which groups of cells perform specialized functions linked by intricate systems of communication but even for the aggregate of more than 1013 cells that form a human body the whole organism has been generated by cell divisions from a single cell the single cell therefore is the vehicle for all of the hereditary information that defines each species figure 11 this cell includes the machinery to gather raw materials from the environment and to construct from them a new cell in its own image complete with a new copy of its hereditary information each and every cell is truly amazing all cells store their hereditary information in the same linear chemical code dna computers have made us familiar with the concept of information as a measurable quantitya million bytes to record a few hundred pages of text or an image from a digital camera 600 million bytes for the music on a cd and so on computers have also made us well aware that the same information can be recorded in many different physical forms the discs and tapes that we used 20 years ago for our electronic archives have become unreadable on presentday machines living cells like computers store information and it is estimated that they have been evolving and diversifying for over 35 billion years it is scarcely to be expected that they would all store their information in the same form or that the archives of one type of cell should be readable by the informationhandling machinery of another and yet it is so all living cells on earth store their hereditary information in the form of doublestranded molecules of dnalong unbranched paired polymer chains formed always of the same four types of monomers these monomers chemical compounds known as nucleotides have nicknames drawn from a fourletter alphabeta t c gand they are strung together in a long linear sequence that encodes the genetic information just as the sequence of 1s and 0s encodes the information in a computer file we can take a piece of dna from a human cell and insert it into a bacterium or a piece of bacterial dna and insert it into a human cell and the information will be successfully read interpreted and copied using chemical methods scientists have learned how to read out the complete sequence of monomers in any dna moleculeextending for many millions of nucleotidesand thereby decipher all of the hereditary information that each organism contains all cells replicate their hereditary information by templated polymerization the mechanisms that make life possible depend on the structure of the doublestranded dna molecule each monomer in a single dna strandthat is each nucleotideconsists of two parts a sugar deoxyribose with a phosphate group attached to it and a base which may be either adenine a guanine g cytosine c or thymine t figure 12 each sugar is linked to the next via the phosphate group creating a polymer chain composed of a repetitive sugarphosphate backbone with a series of bases protruding from it the dna polymer is extended by adding monomers at one end for a single isolated strand these monomers can in principle be added in any order because each one links to the next in the same way through the part of the molecule that is the same for all of them in the living cell however dna is not synthesized as a free strand in isolation but on a template formed by a preexisting dna strand the bases protruding from the existing strand bind to bases of the strand being synthesized according to a strict rule defined by the complementary structures of the bases a binds to t and c binds to g this basepairing holds fresh monomers in place and thereby controls the selection of which one of the four monomers shall be added to the growing strand next in this way a doublestranded structure is created consisting of two exactly complementary sequences of as cs ts and gs the two strands twist around each other forming a dna double helix figure 12e the bonds between the base pairs are weak compared with the sugarphosphate links and this allows the two dna strands to be pulled apart without breakage of their backbones each strand then can serve as a template in the way just described for the synthesis of a fresh dna strand complementary to itselfa fresh copy that is of the hereditary information figure 13 in different types of cells this process of dna replication occurs at different rates with different controls to start it or stop it and different auxiliary molecules to help it along but the basics are universal dna is the information store for heredity and templated polymerization is the way in which this information is copied throughout the living world all cells transcribe portions of their hereditary information into the same intermediary form rna to carry out its informationbearing function dna must do more than copy itself it must also express its information by letting the information guide the synthesis of other molecules in the cell this expression occurs by a mechanism that is the same in all living organisms leading first and foremost to the production of two other key classes of polymers rnas and proteins the process discussed in detail in chapters 6 and 7 begins with a templated polymerization called transcription in which segments of the dna sequence are used as templates for the synthesis of shorter molecules of the closely related polymer ribonucleic acid or rna later in the more complex process of translation many of these rna molecules direct the synthesis of polymers of a radically different chemical classthe proteins figure 14 in rna the backbone is formed of a slightly different sugar from that of dna ribose instead of deoxyriboseand one of the four bases is slightly differenturacil u in place of thymine t but the other three basesa c and gare the same and all four bases pair with their complementary counterparts in dnathe a u c and g of rna with the t a g and c of dna during transcription the rna monomers are lined up and selected for polymerization on a template strand of dna just as dna monomers are selected during replication the outcome is a polymer molecule whose sequence of nucleotides faithfully represents a portion of the cells genetic information even though it is written in a slightly different alphabetconsisting of rna monomers instead of dna monomers the same segment of dna can be used repeatedly to guide the synthesis of many identical rna molecules thus whereas the cells archive of genetic information in the form of dna is fixed and sacrosanct these rna transcripts are massproduced and disposable figure 15 as we shall see these transcripts function as intermediates in the transfer of genetic information most notably they serve as messenger rna mrna molecules that guide the synthesis of proteins according to the genetic instructions stored in the dna rna molecules have distinctive structures that can also give them other specialized chemical capabilities being singlestranded their backbone is flexible so that the polymer chain can bend back on itself to allow one part of the molecule to form weak bonds with another part of the same molecule this occurs when segments of the sequence are locally complementary a gggg segment for example will tend to associate with a cccc segment these types of internal associations can cause an rna chain to fold up into a specific shape that is dictated by its sequence figure 16 the shape of the rna molecule in turn may enable it to recognize other molecules by binding to them selectivelyand even in certain cases to catalyze chemical changes in the molecules that are bound in fact some chemical reactions catalyzed by rna molecules are crucial for several of the most ancient and fundamental processes in living cells and it has been suggested that an extensive catalysis by rna played a central part in the early evolution of life discussed in chapter 6,all life on earth from singlecelled bacteria to complex multicellular organisms shares a foundational cellular structure and a universal genetic system cells the basic units of life are capable of growth division and maintaining order through energydriven chemical reactions hereditary information in all cells is encoded in dnaa doublestranded polymer of nucleotides a t c gwhich preserves genetic instructions that are universally readable dna replication happens through templated polymerization where each dna strand directs the formation of a complementary strand ensuring genetic continuity for cellular function dna information is transcribed into rna an intermediary molecule with a slightly different structure rna being singlestranded can fold into specific shapes that enable it to facilitate protein synthesis and even catalyze essential reactions this transcription and subsequent protein synthesis are central to expressing genetic information in all living organisms despite the immense diversity of life forms this molecular machinery is consistent across species highlighting lifes unity and evolution
all cells use proteins as catalysts protein molecules like dna and rna molecules are long unbranched polymer chains formed by stringing together monomeric building blocks drawn from a standard repertoire that is the same for all living cells like dna and rna proteins carry information in the form of a linear sequence of symbols in the same way as a human message written in an alphabetic script there are many different protein molecules in each cell andleaving out the waterthey form most of the cells mass the monomers of protein the amino acids are quite different from those of dna and rna and there are 20 types instead of 4 each amino acid is built around the same core structure through which it can be linked in a standard way to any other amino acid in the set attached to this core is a side group that gives each amino acid a distinctive chemical character each of the protein molecules is a polypeptide created by joining its amino acids in a particular sequence through billions of years of evolution this sequence has been selected to give the protein a useful function thus by folding into a precise threedimensional form with reactive sites on its surface figure 17a these aminoacid polymers can bind with high specificity to other molecules and can act as enzymes to catalyze reactions that make or break covalent bonds in this way they direct the vast majority of chemical processes in the cell figure 17b proteins have many other functions as wellmaintaining structures generating movements sensing signals and so oneach protein molecule performing a specific function according to its own genetically specified sequence of amino acids proteins above all are the main molecules that put the cells genetic information into action thus polynucleotides specify the amino acid sequences of proteins proteins in turn catalyze many chemical reactions including those by which new dna molecules are synthesized from the most fundamental point of view a living cell is a selfreplicating collection of catalysts that takes in food processes this food to derive both the building blocks and energy needed to make more catalysts and discards the materials left over as waste figure 18a a feedback loop that connects proteins and polynucleotides forms the basis for this autocatalytic selfreproducing behavior of living organisms figure 18b all cells translate rna into protein in the same way how the information in dna specifies the production of proteins was a complete mystery in the 1950s when the doublestranded structure of dna was first revealed as the basis of heredity but in the intervening years scientists have discovered the elegant mechanisms involved the translation of genetic information from the 4letter alphabet of polynucleotides into the 20letter alphabet of proteins is a complex process the rules of this translation seem in some respects neat and rational but in other respects strangely arbitrary given that they are with minor exceptions identical in all living things these arbitrary features it is thought reflect frozen accidents in the early history of life they stem from the chance properties of the earliest organisms that were passed on by heredity and have become so deeply embedded in the constitution of all living cells that they cannot be changed without disastrous effects it turns out that the information in the sequence of a messenger rna molecule is read out in groups of three nucleotides at a time each triplet of nucleotides or codon specifies codes for a single amino acid in a corresponding protein since the number of distinct triplets that can be formed from four nucleotides is 43 there are 64 possible codons all of which occur in nature however there are only 20 naturally occurring amino acids that means there are necessarily many cases in which several codons correspond to the same amino acid this genetic code is read out by a special class of small rna molecules the transfer rnas trnas each type of trna becomes attached at one end to a specific amino acid and displays at its other end a specific sequence of three nucleotidesan anticodon that enables it to recognize through basepairing a particular codon or subset of codons in mrna the intricate chemistry that enables these trnas to translate a specific sequence of a c g and u nucleotides in an mrna molecule into a specific sequence of amino acids in a protein molecule occurs on the ribosome a large multimolecular machine composed of both protein and ribosomal rna all of these processes are described in detail in chapter 6 each protein is encoded by a specific gene dna molecules as a rule are very large containing the specifications for thousands of proteins special sequences in the dna serve as punctuation defining where the information for each protein begins and ends and individual segments of the long dna sequence are transcribed into separate mrna molecules coding for different proteins each such dna segment represents one gene a complication is that rna molecules transcribed from the same dna segment can often be processed in more than one way so as to give rise to a set of alternative versions of a protein especially in more complex cells such as those of plants and animals in addition some dna segmentsa smaller numberare transcribed into rna molecules that are not translated but have catalytic regulatory or structural functions such dna segments also count as genes a gene therefore is defined as the segment of dna sequence corresponding to a single protein or set of alternative protein variants or to a single catalytic regulatory or structural rna molecule in all cells the expression of individual genes is regulated instead of manufacturing its full repertoire of possible proteins at full tilt all the time the cell adjusts the rate of transcription and translation of different genes independently according to need stretches of regulatory dna are interspersed among the segments that code for protein and these noncoding regions bind to special protein molecules that control the local rate of transcription the quantity and organization of the regulatory dna vary widely from one class of organisms to another but the basic strategy is universal in this way the genome of the cellthat is the totality of its genetic information as embodied in its complete dna sequence dictates not only the nature of the cells proteins but also when and where they are to be made life requires free energy a living cell is a dynamic chemical system operating far from chemical equilibrium for a cell to grow or to make a new cell in its own image it must take in free energy from the environment as well as raw materials to drive the necessary synthetic reactions this consumption of free energy is fundamental to life when it stops a cell decays toward chemical equilibrium and soon dies genetic information is also fundamental to life and free energy is required for the propagation of this information for example to specify one bit of informationthat is one yesno choice between two equally probable alternatives costs a defined amount of free energy that can be calculated the quantitative relationship involves some deep reasoning and depends on a precise definition of the term free energy as explained in chapter 2 the basic idea however is not difficult to understand intuitively picture the molecules in a cell as a swarm of objects endowed with thermal energy moving around violently at random buffeted by collisions with one another to specify genetic informationin the form of a dna sequence for examplemolecules from this wild crowd must be captured arranged in a specific order defined by some preexisting template and linked together in a fixed relationship the bonds that hold the molecules in their proper places on the template and join them together must be strong enough to resist the disordering effect of thermal motion the process is driven forward by consumption of free energy which is needed to ensure that the correct bonds are made and made robustly in the simplest case the molecules can be compared with springloaded traps ready to snap into a more stable lowerenergy attached state when they meet their proper partners as they snap together into the bonded arrangement their available stored energytheir free energylike the energy of the spring in the trap is released and dissipated as heat in a cell the chemical processes underlying information transfer are more complex but the same basic principle applies free energy has to be spent on the creation of order to replicate its genetic information faithfully and indeed to make all its complex molecules according to the correct specifications the cell therefore requires free energy which has to be imported somehow from the surroundings as we shall see in chapter 2 the free energy required by animal cells is derived from chemical bonds in food molecules that the animals eat while plants get their free energy from sunlight,proteins act as catalysts in cells playing essential roles in cellular functions they are long polymers made of amino acids which are linked together to form polypeptides with specific sequences allowing proteins to fold into precise shapes for functions like catalysis structure and signaling amino acids the building blocks of proteins come in 20 types each contributing unique chemical properties proteins threedimensional structures enable specific interactions often acting as enzymes that catalyze key reactions cells translate rna into proteins using a universal genetic code in which each group of three nucleotides codon in mrna corresponds to an amino acid assisted by transfer rna trna and ribosomes genes dna segments that code for proteins may undergo alternative splicing producing different protein variants cellular gene expression is regulated by noncoding dna sequences and specialized proteins allowing adaptation to cellular needs furthermore all living cells rely on free energy primarily from food or sunlight to drive synthetic reactions and maintain order counteracting the natural drive toward chemical equilibrium
all cells function as biochemical factories dealing with the same basic molecular building blocks because all cells make dna rna and protein all cells have to contain and manipulate a similar collection of small molecules including simple sugars nucleotides and amino acids as well as other substances that are universally required all cells for example require the phosphorylated nucleotide atp adenosine triphosphate not only as a building block for the synthesis of dna and rna but also as a carrier of the free energy that is needed to drive a huge number of chemical reactions in the cell although all cells function as biochemical factories of a broadly similar type many of the details of their smallmolecule transactions differ some organisms such as plants require only the simplest of nutrients and harness the energy of sunlight to make all their own small organic molecules other organisms such as animals feed on living things and must obtain many of their organic molecules readymade we return to this point later all cells are enclosed in a plasma membrane across which nutrients and waste materials must pass another universal feature is that each cell is enclosed by a membranethe plasma membrane this container acts as a selective barrier that enables the cell to concentrate nutrients gathered from its environment and retain the products it synthesizes for its own use while excreting its waste products without a plasma membrane the cell could not maintain its integrity as a coordinated chemical system the molecules that form a membrane have the simple physicochemical property of being amphiphilicthat is consisting of one part that is hydrophobic waterinsoluble and another part that is hydrophilic watersoluble such molecules placed in water aggregate spontaneously arranging their hydrophobic portions to be as much in contact with one another as possible to hide them from the water while keeping their hydrophilic portions exposed amphiphilic molecules of appropriate shape such as the phospholipid molecules that comprise most of the plasma membrane spontaneously aggregate in water to create a bilayer that forms small closed vesicles figure 19 the phenomenon can be demonstrated in a test tube by simply mixing phospholipids and water together under appropriate conditions small vesicles form whose aqueous contents are isolated from the external medium although the chemical details vary the hydrophobic tails of the predominant membrane molecules in all cells are hydrocarbon polymers ch2ch2ch2 and their spontaneous assembly into a bilayered vesicle is but one of many examples of an important general principle cells produce molecules whose chemical properties cause them to selfassemble into the structures that a cell needs the cell boundary cannot be totally impermeable if a cell is to grow and reproduce it must be able to import raw materials and export waste across its plasma membrane all cells therefore have specialized proteins embedded in their membrane that transport specific molecules from one side to the other some of these membrane transport proteins like some of the proteins that catalyze the fundamental smallmolecule reactions inside the cell have been so well preserved over the course of evolution that we can recognize the family resemblances between them in comparisons of even the most distantly related groups of living organisms the transport proteins in the membrane largely determine which molecules enter the cell and the catalytic proteins inside the cell determine the reactions that those molecules undergo thus by specifying the proteins that the cell is to manufacture the genetic information recorded in the dna sequence dictates the entire chemistry of the cell and not only its chemistry but also its form and its behavior for these too are chiefly constructed and controlled by the cells proteins a living cell can exist with fewer than 500 genes the basic principles of biological information transfer are simple enough but how complex are real living cells in particular what are the minimum requirements we can get a rough indication by considering a species that has one of the smallest known genomesthe bacterium mycoplasma genitalium figure 110 this organism lives as a parasite in mammals and its environment provides it with many of its small molecules readymade nevertheless it still has to make all the large moleculesdna rnas and proteinsrequired for the basic processes of heredity it has about 530 genes about 400 of which are essential its genome of 580070 nucleotide pairs represents 145018 bytes of informationabout as much as it takes to record the text of one chapter of this book cell biology may be complicated but it is not impossibly so the minimum number of genes for a viable cell in todays environments is probably not less than 300 although there are only about 60 genes in the core set that is shared by all living species the individual cell is the minimal selfreproducing unit of living matter and it consists of a selfreplicating collection of catalysts central to this reproduction is the transmission of genetic information to progeny cells every cell on our planet stores its genetic information in the same chemical formas doublestranded dna the cell replicates its information by separating the paired dna strands and using each as a template for polymerization to make a new dna strand with a complementary sequence of nucleotides the same strategy of templated polymerization is used to transcribe portions of the information from dna into molecules of the closely related polymer rna these rna molecules in turn guide the synthesis of protein molecules by the more complex machinery of translation involving a large multimolecular machine the ribosome proteins are the principal catalysts for almost all the chemical reactions in the cell their other functions include the selective import and export of small molecules across the plasma membrane that forms the cells boundary the specific function of each protein depends on its amino acid sequence which is specified by the nucleotide sequence of a corresponding segment of the dnathe gene that codes for that protein in this way the genome of the cell determines its chemistry and the chemistry of every living cell is fundamentally similar because it must provide for the synthesis of dna rna and protein the simplest known cells can survive with about 400 genes,all cells function as biochemical factories synthesizing dna rna and proteins they require atp a molecule that stores and transfers energy as well as basic building blocks like simple sugars nucleotides and amino acids cells are enclosed by a plasma membrane a selective barrier that regulates the intake of nutrients and export of waste this membrane is composed of amphiphilic molecules which naturally assemble into a bilayer that can form vesicles essential proteins embedded in the membrane transport specific molecules and drive reactions a cells genetic information in dna determines its chemistry structure and functions as it codes for specific proteins essential for these processes even the simplest cells like mycoplasma genitalium which has around 530 genes require a minimum set of genes to survive showing that cellular life while complex follows universal principles key concepts atp adenosine triphosphate a nucleotide that carries energy within the cell plasma membrane the cells selective barrier composed of amphiphilic molecules amphiphilic molecules molecules with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts forming cell membranes genetic information encoded in dna dictates the cells chemistry form and behavior proteins catalysts for cellular reactions enabling nutrient transport and structural integrity
the diversity of genomes and the tree of life the success of living organisms based on dna rna and protein has been spectacular life has populated the oceans covered the land infiltrated the earths crust and molded the surface of our planet our oxygenrich atmosphere the deposits of coal and oil the layers of iron ores the cliffs of chalk and limestone and marbleall these are products directly or indirectly of past biological activity on earth living things are not confined to the familiar temperate realm of land water and sunlight inhabited by plants and planteating animals they can be found in the darkest depths of the ocean in hot volcanic mud in pools beneath the frozen surface of the antarctic and buried kilometers deep in the earths crust the creatures that live in these extreme environments are generally unfamiliar not only because they are inaccessible but also because they are mostly microscopic in more homely habitats too most organisms are too small for us to see without special equipment they tend to go unnoticed unless they cause a disease or rot the timbers of our houses yet microorganisms make up most of the total mass of living matter on our planet only recently through new methods of molecular analysis and specifically through the analysis of dna sequences have we begun to get a picture of life on earth that is not grossly distorted by our biased perspective as large animals living on dry land in this section we consider the diversity of organisms and the relationships among them because the genetic information for every organism is written in the universal language of dna sequences and the dna sequence of any given organism can be readily obtained by standard biochemical techniques it is now possible to characterize catalog and compare any set of living organisms with reference to these sequences from such comparisons we can estimate the place of each organism in the family tree of living speciesthe tree of life but before describing what this approach reveals we need first to consider the routes by which cells in different environments obtain the matter and energy they require to survive and proliferate and the ways in which some classes of organisms depend on others for their basic chemical needs cells can be powered by a variety of freeenergy sources living organisms obtain their free energy in different ways some such as animals fungi and the many different bacteria that live in the human gut get it by feeding on other living things or the organic chemicals they produce such organisms are called organotrophic from the greek word trophe meaning food others derive their energy directly from the nonliving world these primary energy converters fall into two classes those that harvest the energy of sunlight and those that capture their energy from energyrich systems of inorganic chemicals in the environment chemical systems that are far from chemical equilibrium organisms of the former class are called phototrophic feeding on sunlight those of the latter are called lithotrophic feeding on rock organotrophic organisms could not exist without these primary energy converters which are the most plentiful form of life phototrophic organisms include many types of bacteria as well as algae and plants on which weand virtually all the living things that we ordinarily see around usdepend phototrophic organisms have changed the whole chemistry of our environment the oxygen in the earths atmosphere is a byproduct of their biosynthetic activities lithotrophic organisms are not such an obvious feature of our world because they are microscopic and mostly live in habitats that humans do not frequent deep in the ocean buried in the earths crust or in various other inhospitable environments but they are a major part of the living world and they are especially important in any consideration of the history of life on earth some lithotrophs get energy from aerobic reactions which use molecular oxygen from the environment since atmospheric o2 is ultimately the product of living organisms these aerobic lithotrophs are in a sense feeding on the products of past life there are however other lithotrophs that live anaerobically in places where little or no molecular oxygen is present these are circumstances similar to those that existed in the early days of life on earth before oxygen had accumulated the most dramatic of these sites are the hot hydrothermal vents on the floor of the pacific and atlantic oceans they are located where the ocean floor is spreading as new portions of the earths crust form by a gradual upwelling of material from the earths interior figure 111 downwardpercolating seawater is heated and driven back upward as a submarine geyser carrying with it a current of chemicals from the hot rocks below a typical cocktail might include h2s h2 co mn2 fe2 ni2 ch4 nh4 and phosphoruscontaining compounds a dense population of microbes lives in the neighborhood of the vent thriving on this austere diet and harvesting free energy from reactions between the available chemicals other organismsclams mussels and giant marine wormsin turn live off the microbes at the vent forming an entire ecosystem analogous to the world of plants and animals that we belong to but powered by geochemical energy instead of light figure 112 some cells fix nitrogen and carbon dioxide for others to make a living cell requires matter as well as free energy dna rna and protein are composed of just six elements hydrogen carbon nitrogen oxygen sulfur and phosphorus these are all plentiful in the nonliving environment in the earths rocks water and atmosphere but they are not present in chemical forms that allow easy incorporation into biological molecules atmospheric n2 and co2 in particular are extremely unreactive a large amount of free energy is required to drive the reactions that use these inorganic molecules to make the organic compounds needed for further biosynthesisthat is to fix nitrogen and carbon dioxide so as to make n and c available to living organisms many types of living cells lack the biochemical machinery to achieve this fixation they instead rely on other classes of cells to do the job for them we animals depend on plants for our supplies of organic carbon and nitrogen compounds plants in turn although they can fix carbon dioxide from the atmosphere lack the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen they depend in part on nitrogenfixing bacteria to supply their need for nitrogen compounds plants of the pea family for example harbor symbiotic nitrogenfixing bacteria in nodules in their roots living cells therefore differ widely in some of the most basic aspects of their biochemistry not surprisingly cells with complementary needs and capabilities have developed close associations some of these associations as we see below have evolved to the point where the partners have lost their separate identities altogether they have joined forces to form a single composite cell the greatest biochemical diversity exists among prokaryotic cells from simple microscopy it has long been clear that living organisms can be classified on the basis of cell structure into two groups the eukaryotes and the prokaryotes eukaryotes keep their dna in a distinct membraneenclosed intracellular compartment called the nucleus the name is from the greek meaning truly nucleated from the words eu well or truly and karyon kernel or nucleus prokaryotes have no distinct nuclear compartment to house their dna plants fungi and animals are eukaryotes bacteria are prokaryotes as are archaeaa separate class of prokaryotic cells discussed below most prokaryotic cells are small and simple in outward appearance figure 113 and they live mostly as independent individuals or in loosely organized communities rather than as multicellular organisms they are typically spherical or rodshaped and measure a few micrometers in linear dimension they often have a tough protective coat called a cell wall beneath which a plasma membrane encloses a single cytoplasmic compartment containing dna rna proteins and the many small molecules needed for life in the electron microscope this cell interior appears as a matrix of varying texture without any discernible organized internal structure figure 114 prokaryotic cells live in an enormous variety of ecological niches and they are astonishingly varied in their biochemical capabilitiesfar more so than eukaryotic cells organotrophic species can utilize virtually any type of organic molecule as food from sugars and amino acids to hydrocarbons and methane gas phototrophic species figure 115 harvest light energy in a variety of ways some of them generating oxygen as a byproduct others not lithotrophic species can feed on a plain diet of inorganic nutrients getting their carbon from co2 and relying on h2s to fuel their energy needs figure 116or on h2 or fe2 or elemental sulfur or any of a host of other chemicals that occur in the environment much of this world of microscopic organisms is virtually unexplored traditional methods of bacteriology have given us an acquaintance with those species that can be isolated and cultured in the laboratory but dna sequence analysis of the populations of bacteria and archaea in samples from natural habitatssuch as soil or ocean water or even the human mouthhas opened our eyes to the fact that most species cannot be cultured by standard laboratory techniques according to one estimate at least 99 of prokaryotic species remain to be characterized detected only by their dna it has not yet been possible to grow the vast majority of them in laboratories the tree of life has three primary branches bacteria archaea and eukaryotes the classification of living things has traditionally depended on comparisons of their outward appearances we can see that a fish has eyes jaws backbone brain and so on just as we do and that a worm does not that a rosebush is cousin to an apple tree but is less similar to a grass as darwin showed we can readily interpret such close family resemblances in terms of evolution from common ancestors and we can find the remains of many of these ancestors preserved in the fossil record in this way it has been possible to begin to draw a family tree of living organisms showing the various lines of descent as well as branch points in the history where the ancestors of one group of species became different from those of another when the disparities between organisms become very great however these methods begin to fail how do we decide whether a fungus is closer kin to a plant or to an animal when it comes to prokaryotes the task becomes harder still one microscopic rod or sphere looks much like another microbiologists have therefore sought to classify prokaryotes in terms of their biochemistry and nutritional requirements but this approach also has its pitfalls amid the bewildering variety of biochemical behaviors it is difficult to know which differences truly reflect differences of evolutionary history genome analysis has now given us a simpler more direct and much more powerful way to determine evolutionary relationships the complete dna sequence of an organism defines its nature with almost perfect precision and in exhaustive detail moreover this specification is in a digital forma string of lettersthat can be entered straightforwardly into a computer and compared with the corresponding information for any other living thing because dna is subject to random changes that accumulate over long periods of time as we shall see shortly the number of differences between the dna sequences of two organisms can provide a direct objective quantitative indication of the evolutionary distance between them this approach has shown that the organisms that were traditionally classed together as bacteria can be as widely divergent in their evolutionary origins as is any prokaryote from any eukaryote it is now clear that the prokaryotes comprise two distinct groups that diverged early in the history of life on earth before the eukaryotes diverged as a separate group the two groups of prokaryotes are called the bacteria or eubacteria and the archaea or archaebacteria detailed genome analyses have recently revealed that the first eukayotic cell formed after a particular type of ancient archaeal cell engulfed an ancient bacterium see figure 123 thus the living world today is considered to consist of three major divisions or domains bacteria archaea and eukaryotes figure 117 archaea are often found inhabiting environments that we humans avoid such as bogs sewage treatment plants ocean depths salt brines and hot acid springs although they are also widespread in less extreme and more homely environments from soils and lakes to the stomachs of cattle in outward appearance they are not easily distinguished from bacteria at a molecular level archaea seem to resemble eukaryotes more closely in their machinery for handling genetic information replication transcription and translation but bacteria more closely in their apparatus for metabolism and energy conversion we discuss below how this might be explained,life on earth is astonishingly diverse occupying environments from deep oceans and volcanic springs to temperate habitats organisms obtain energy in three main ways organotrophs consume organic material phototrophs harness sunlight and lithotrophs derive energy from inorganic chemicals this diversity underpins ecosystems where organisms often rely on others to fix essential elements like nitrogen and carbon dioxide for instance nitrogenfixing bacteria supply plants with nitrogen compounds and plants in turn support animal life all life forms are connected within the tree of life which has three primary branches bacteria archaea and eukaryotes bacteria and archaea collectively called prokaryotes are singlecelled organisms without a nucleus while eukaryotes plants animals fungi have a nucleus prokaryotes display remarkable biochemical diversity thriving in nearly every ecological niche although most prokaryotic species remain uncultured and unexplored in labs dna sequencing has transformed our understanding revealing evolutionary relationships and helping classify life beyond traditional visual or biochemical methods by analyzing dna changes over time scientists can map the evolutionary distance between species shedding light on lifes history and diversity in ways unimaginable before genome analysis
some genes evolve rapidly others are highly conserved both in the storage and in the copying of genetic information random accidents and errors occur altering the nucleotide sequencethat is creating mutations therefore when a cell divides its two daughters are often not quite identical to one another or to their parent on rare occasions the error may represent a change for the better more probably it will cause no significant difference in the cells prospects but in many cases the error will cause serious damagefor example by disrupting the coding sequence for a key protein changes due to mistakes of the first type will tend to be perpetuated because the altered cell has an increased likelihood of reproducing itself changes due to mistakes of the second typeselectively neutral changesmay be perpetuated or not in the competition for limited resources it is a matter of chance whether the altered cell or its cousins will succeed but changes that cause serious damage lead nowhere the cell that suffers them dies leaving no progeny through endless repetition of this cycle of error and trialof mutation and natural selectionorganisms evolve their genetic specifications change giving them new ways to exploit the environment more effectively to survive in competition with others and to reproduce successfully some parts of the genome will change more easily than others in the course of evolution a segment of dna that does not code for protein and has no significant regulatory role is free to change at a rate limited only by the frequency of random errors in contrast a gene that codes for a highly optimized essential protein or rna molecule cannot alter so easily when mistakes occur the faulty cells are almost always eliminated genes of this latter sort are therefore highly conserved through 35 billion years or more of evolutionary history many features of the genome have changed beyond all recognition but the most highly conserved genes remain perfectly recognizable in all living species these latter genes are the ones we must examine if we wish to trace family relationships between the most distantly related organisms in the tree of life the initial studies that led to the classification of the living world into the three domains of bacteria archaea and eukaryotes were based chiefly on analysis of one of the rrna components of the ribosome because the translation of rna into protein is fundamental to all living cells this component of the ribosome has been very well conserved since early in the history of life on earth figure 118 most bacteria and archaea have 10006000 genes natural selection has generally favored those prokaryotic cells that can reproduce the fastest by taking up raw materials from their environment and replicating themselves most efficiently at the maximal rate permitted by the available food supplies small size implies a large ratio of surface area to volume thereby helping to maximize the uptake of nutrients across the plasma membrane and boosting a cells reproductive rate presumably for these reasons most prokaryotic cells carry very little superfluous baggage their genomes are small with genes packed closely together and minimal quantities of regulatory dna between them the small genome size has made it easy to use modern dna sequencing techniques to determine complete genome sequences we now have this information for thousands of species of bacteria and archaea as well as for hundreds of species of eukaryotes most bacterial and archaeal genomes contain between 106 and 107 nucleotide pairs encoding 10006000 genes a complete dna sequence reveals both the genes an organism possesses and the genes it lacks when we compare the three domains of the living world we can begin to see which genes are common to all of them and must therefore have been present in the cell that was ancestral to all presentday living things and which genes are peculiar to a single branch in the tree of life to explain the findings however we need to consider a little more closely how new genes arise and genomes evolve new genes are generated from preexisting genes the raw material of evolution is the dna sequence that already exists there is no natural mechanism for making long stretches of new random sequence in this sense no gene is ever entirely new innovation can however occur in several ways figure 119 1 intragenic mutation an existing gene can be randomly modified by changes in its dna sequence through various types of error that occur mainly in the process of dna replication 2 gene duplication an existing gene can be accidentally duplicated so as to create a pair of initially identical genes within a single cell these two genes may then diverge in the course of evolution 3 dna segment shuffling two or more existing genes can break and rejoin to make a hybrid gene consisting of dna segments that originally belonged to separate genes 4 horizontal intercellular transfer a piece of dna can be transferred from the genome of one cell to that of anothereven to that of another species this process is in contrast with the usual vertical transfer of genetic information from parent to progeny each of these types of change leaves a characteristic trace in the dna sequence of the organism and there is clear evidence that all four processes have frequently occurred in later chapters we discuss the underlying mechanisms but for the present we focus on the consequences gene duplications give rise to families of related genes within a single cell a cell duplicates its entire genome each time it divides into two daughter cells however accidents occasionally result in the inappropriate duplication of just part of the genome with retention of original and duplicate segments in a single cell once a gene has been duplicated in this way one of the two gene copies is free to mutate and become specialized to perform a different function within the same cell repeated rounds of this process of duplication and divergence over many millions of years have enabled one gene to give rise to a family of genes that may all be found within a single genome analysis of the dna sequence of prokaryotic genomes reveals many examples of such gene families in the bacterium bacillus subtilis for example 47 of the genes have one or more obvious relatives figure 120 when genes duplicate and diverge in this way the individuals of one species become endowed with multiple variants of a primordial gene this evolutionary process has to be distinguished from the genetic divergence that occurs when one species of organism splits into two separate lines of descent at a branch point in the family treewhen the human line of descent became separate from that of chimpanzees for example there the genes gradually become different in the course of evolution but they are likely to continue to have corresponding functions in the two sister species genes that are related by descent in this waythat is genes in two separate species that derive from the same ancestral gene in the last common ancestor of those two speciesare called orthologs related genes that have resulted from a gene duplication event within a single genomeand are likely to have diverged in their functionare called paralogs genes that are related by descent in either way are called homologs a general term used to cover both types of relationship figure 121 genes can be transferred between organisms both in the laboratory and in nature prokaryotes provide good examples of the horizontal transfer of genes from one species of cell to another the most obvious telltale signs are sequences recognizable as being derived from viruses those infecting bacteria being called bacteriophages figure 122 viruses are small packets of genetic material that have evolved as parasites on the reproductive and biosynthetic machinery of host cells although not themselves living cells they often serve as vectors for gene transfer a virus will replicate in one cell emerge from it with a protective wrapping and then enter and infect another cell which may be of the same or a different species often the infected cell will be killed by the massive proliferation of virus particles inside it but sometimes the viral dna instead of directly generating these particles may persist in its host for many cell generations as a relatively innocuous passenger either as a separate intracellular fragment of dna known as a plasmid or as a sequence inserted into the cells regular genome in their travels viruses can accidentally pick up fragments of dna from the genome of one host cell and ferry them into another cell such transfers of genetic material are very common in prokaryotes horizontal transfers of genes between eukaryotic cells of different species are very rare and they do not seem to have played a significant part in eukaryote evolution although massive transfers from bacterial to eukaryotic genomes have occurred in the evolution of mitochondria and chloroplasts as we discuss below in contrast horizontal gene transfers occur much more frequently between different species of prokaryotes many prokaryotes have a remarkable capacity to take up even nonviral dna molecules from their surroundings and thereby capture the genetic information these molecules carry by this route or by virusmediated transfer bacteria and archaea in the wild can acquire genes from neighboring cells relatively easily genes that confer resistance to an antibiotic or an ability to produce a toxin for example can be transferred from species to species and provide the recipient bacterium with a selective advantage in this way new and sometimes dangerous strains of bacteria have been observed to evolve in the bacterial ecosystems that inhabit hospitals or the various niches in the human body for example horizontal gene transfer is responsible for the spread over the past 40 years of penicillinresistant strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae the bacterium that causes gonorrhea on a longer time scale the results can be even more profound it has been estimated that at least 18 of all of the genes in the presentday genome of e coli have been acquired by horizontal transfer from another species within the past 100 million years,mutations or random errors in dna replication introduce genetic variations in cells some mutations improve survival while harmful ones are often eliminated this mutation and selection cycle underpins evolution creating genetic adaptations for better survival and reproduction highly essential genes such as those coding for ribosomal rna remain highly conservedminimizing change to preserve vital functions while nonessential or noncoding dna mutates more freely prokaryotic genomes eg bacteria and archaea typically contain 10006000 tightly packed genes optimized for rapid replication key processes creating new genes from existing ones include intragenic mutation small internal gene changes gene duplication forming gene copies that can acquire new functions dna segment shuffling combining segments of different genes to form hybrids and horizontal gene transfer direct dna exchange between species horizontal gene transfer common in prokaryotes spreads beneficial genes like antibiotic resistance allowing bacteria to adapt quickly in competitive environments this rapid adaptation can lead to the emergence of drugresistant strains such as penicillinresistant neisseria gonorrhoeae through mutation duplication and gene transfer genomes evolve creating new genetic pathways that enhance survival and expand biodiversity across life forms
sex results in horizontal exchanges of genetic information within a species horizontal gene transfer among prokaryotes has a parallel in a phenomenon familiar to us all sex in addition to the usual vertical transfer of genetic material from parent to offspring sexual reproduction causes a largescale horizontal transfer of genetic information between two initially separate cell lineagesthose of the father and the mother a key feature of sex of course is that the genetic exchange normally occurs only between individuals of the same species but no matter whether they occur within a species or between species horizontal gene transfers leave a characteristic imprint they result in individuals who are related more closely to one set of relatives with respect to some genes and more closely to another set of relatives with respect to others by comparing the dna sequences of individual human genomes an intelligent visitor from outer space could deduce that humans reproduce sexually even if it knew nothing about human behavior sexual reproduction is widespread although not universal especially among eukaryotes even bacteria indulge from time to time in controlled sexual exchanges of dna with other members of their own species natural selection has clearly favored organisms that can reproduce sexually although evolutionary theorists dispute precisely what that selective advantage is the function of a gene can often be deduced from its sequence family relationships among genes are important not just for their historical interest but because they simplify the task of deciphering gene functions once the sequence of a newly discovered gene has been determined a scientist can tap a few keys on a computer to search the entire database of known gene sequences for genes related to it in many cases the function of one or more of these homologs will have been already determined experimentally since gene sequence determines gene function one can frequently make a good guess at the function of the new gene it is likely to be similar to that of the already known homologs in this way it is possible to decipher a great deal of the biology of an organism simply by analyzing the dna sequence of its genome and using the information we already have about the functions of genes in other organisms that have been more intensively studied more than 200 gene families are common to all three primary branches of the tree of life given the complete genome sequences of representative organisms from all three domainsarchaea bacteria and eukaryoteswe can search systematically for homologies that span this enormous evolutionary divide in this way we can begin to take stock of the common inheritance of all living things there are considerable difficulties in this enterprise for example individual species have often lost some of the ancestral genes other genes have almost certainly been acquired by horizontal transfer from another species and therefore are not truly ancestral even though shared in fact genome comparisons strongly suggest that both lineagespecific gene loss and horizontal gene transfer in some cases between evolutionarily distant species have been major factors of evolution at least among prokaryotes finally in the course of 2 or 3 billion years some genes that were initially shared will have changed beyond recognition through mutation because of all these vagaries of the evolutionary process it seems that only a small proportion of ancestral gene families has been universally retained in a recognizable form thus out of 4873 proteincoding gene families defined by comparing the genomes of 50 species of bacteria 13 archaea and 3 unicellular eukaryotes only 63 are truly ubiquitous that is represented in all the genomes analyzed the great majority of these universal families include components of the translation and transcription systems this is not likely to be a realistic approximation of an ancestral gene set a betterthough still crudeidea of the latter can be obtained by tallying the gene families that have representatives in multiple but not necessarily all species from all three major domains such an analysis reveals 264 ancient conserved families each family can be assigned a function at least in terms of general biochemical activity but usually with more precision as shown in table 11 the largest number of shared gene families are involved in translation and in amino acid metabolism and transport however this set of highly conserved gene families represents only a very rough sketch of the common inheritance of all modern life a more precise reconstruction of the gene complement of the last universal common ancestor will hopefully become feasible with further genome sequencing and more sophisticated forms of comparative analysis mutations reveal the functions of genes without additional information no amount of gazing at genome sequences will reveal the functions of genes we may recognize that gene b is like gene a but how do we discover the function of gene a in the first place and even if we know the function of gene a how do we test whether the function of gene b is truly the same as the sequence similarity suggests how do we connect the world of abstract genetic information with the world of real living organisms the analysis of gene functions depends on two complementary approaches genetics and biochemistry genetics starts with the study of mutants we either find or make an organism in which a gene is altered and then examine the effects on the organisms structure and performance figure 123 biochemistry more directly examines the functions of molecules here we extract molecules from an organism and then study their chemical activities by combining genetics and biochemistry it is possible to find those molecules whose production depends on a given gene at the same time careful studies of the performance of the mutant organism show us what role those molecules have in the operation of the organism as a whole thus genetics and biochemistry used in combination with cell biology provide the best way to relate genes and molecules to the structure and function of an organism in recent years dna sequence information and the powerful tools of molecular biology have accelerated progress from sequence comparisons we can often identify particular subregions within a gene that have been preserved nearly unchanged over the course of evolution these conserved subregions are likely to be the most important parts of the gene in terms of function we can test their individual contributions to the activity of the gene product by creating in the laboratory mutations of specific sites within the gene or by constructing artificial hybrid genes that combine part of one gene with part of another organisms can be engineered to make either the rna or the protein specified by the gene in large quantities to facilitate biochemical analysis specialists in molecular structure can determine the threedimensional conformation of the gene product revealing the exact position of every atom in it biochemists can determine how each of the parts of the genetically specified molecule contributes to its chemical behavior cell biologists can analyze the behavior of cells that are engineered to express a mutant version of the gene there is however no one simple recipe for discovering a genes function and no simple standard universal format for describing it we may discover for example that the product of a given gene catalyzes a certain chemical reaction and yet have no idea how or why that reaction is important to the organism the functional characterization of each new family of gene products unlike the description of the gene sequences presents a fresh challenge to the biologists ingenuity moreover we will never fully understand the function of a gene until we learn its role in the life of the organism as a whole to make ultimate sense of gene functions therefore we have to study whole organisms not just molecules or cells molecular biology began with a spotlight on e coli because living organisms are so complex the more we learn about any particular species the more attractive it becomes as an object for further study each discovery raises new questions and provides new tools with which to tackle general questions in the context of the chosen organism for this reason large communities of biologists have become dedicated to studying different aspects of the same model organism in the early days of molecular biology the spotlight focused intensely on just one species the escherichia coli or e coli bacterium see figures 113 and 114 this small rodshaped bacterial cell normally lives in the gut of humans and other vertebrates but it can be grown easily in a simple nutrient broth in a culture bottle it adapts to variable chemical conditions and reproduces rapidly and it can evolve by mutation and selection at a remarkable speed as with other bacteria different strains of e coli though classified as members of a single species differ genetically to a much greater degree than do different varieties of a sexually reproducing organism such as a plant or animal one e coli strain may possess many hundreds of genes that are absent from another and the two strains could have as little as 50 of their genes in common the standard laboratory strain e coli k12 has a genome of approximately 46 million nucleotide pairs contained in a single circular molecule of dna that codes for about 4300 different kinds of proteins figure 124 in molecular terms we know more about e coli than about any other living organism most of our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of life for example how cells replicate their dna or how they decode the instructions represented in the dna to direct the synthesis of specific proteinsinitially came from studies of e coli the basic genetic mechanisms have turned out to be highly conserved throughout evolution these mechanisms are essentially the same in our own cells as in e coli prokaryotes cells without a distinct nucleus are biochemically the most diverse organisms and include species that can obtain all their energy and nutrients from inorganic chemical sources such as the reactive mixtures of minerals released at hydrothermal vents on the ocean floorthe sort of diet that may have nourished the first living cells 35 billion years ago dna sequence comparisons reveal the family relationships of living organisms and show that the prokaryotes fall into two groups that diverged early in the course of evolution the bacteria or eubacteria and the archaea together with the eukaryotes cells with a membraneenclosed nucleus these constitute the three primary branches of the tree of life most bacteria and archaea are small unicellular organisms with compact genomes comprising 10006000 genes many of the genes within a single organism show strong family resemblances in their dna sequences implying that they originated from the same ancestral gene through gene duplication and divergence family resemblances homologies are also clear when gene sequences are compared between different species and more than 200 gene families have been so highly conserved that they can be recognized as common to most species from all three domains of the living world thus given the dna sequence of a newly discovered gene it is often possible to deduce the genes function from the known function of a homologous gene in an intensively studied model organism such as the bacterium e coli,sexual reproduction in eukaryotes and controlled dna exchanges in some bacteria illustrate horizontal gene transfer within species unlike vertical inheritance where genes are passed only from parent to offspring horizontal transfer allows genetic mixing between unrelated cell lineages producing individuals with genes that link them more closely to different relatives by comparing dna sequences across organisms scientists can infer gene functions as similar sequences often indicate similar roles across the domains of lifebacteria archaea and eukaryotessome ancestral genes persist despite gene loss and horizontal transfers complicating lineage tracking while only 63 gene families are universally conserved they primarily support basic processes like translation showing a common biological heritage understanding gene functions combines genetics where organismal changes reveal gene roles and biochemistry which analyzes cellular chemical activities model organisms like escherichia coli e coli a wellstudied bacterium with a 46 million nucleotide genome have been crucial for discoveries about dna replication and protein synthesis mechanisms conserved across life forms prokaryotes including bacteria and archaea are biochemically diverse with many able to derive energy from inorganic sources through gene duplication and divergence prokaryotic evolution links these ancient organisms to the origins of life on earth revealing the deep genetic relationships among all living species
genetic information in eukaryotes eukaryotic cells in general are bigger and more elaborate than prokaryotic cells and their genomes are bigger and more elaborate too the greater size is accompanied by radical differences in cell structure and function moreover many classes of eukaryotic cells form multicellular organisms that attain levels of complexity unmatched by any prokaryote because they are so complex eukaryotes confront molecular biologists with a special set of challenges that will concern us in the rest of this book increasingly biologists attempt to meet these challenges through the analysis and manipulation of the genetic information within cells and organisms it is therefore important at the outset to know something of the special features of the eukaryotic genome we begin by briefly discussing how eukaryotic cells are organized how this reflects their way of life and how their genomes differ from those of prokaryotes this leads us to an outline of the strategy by which cell biologists by exploiting genetic and biochemical information are attempting to discover how eukaryotic organisms work eukaryotic cells may have originated as predators by definition eukaryotic cells keep their dna in an internal compartment called the nucleus the nuclear envelope a double layer of membrane surrounds the nucleus and separates the dna from the cytoplasm eukaryotes also have other features that set them apart from prokaryotes figure 125 their cells are typically 10 times bigger in linear dimension and 1000 times larger in volume they have an elaborate cytoskeletona system of protein filaments crisscrossing the cytoplasm and forming together with the many proteins that attach to them a system of girders ropes and motors that gives the cell mechanical strength controls its shape and drives and guides its movements movie 11 and the nuclear envelope is only one part of a set of internal membranes each structurally similar to the plasma membrane and enclosing different types of spaces inside the cell many of them involved in digestion and secretion lacking the tough cell wall of most bacteria animal cells and the freeliving eukaryotic cells called protozoa can change their shape rapidly and engulf other cells and small objects by phagocytosis figure 126 how all of the unique properties of eukaryotic cells evolved and in what sequence is still a mystery one plausible view however is that they are all reflections of the way of life of a primordial cell that was a predator living by capturing other cells and eating them figure 127 such a way of life requires a large cell with a flexible plasma membrane as well as an elaborate cytoskeleton to support and move this membrane it may also require that the cells long fragile dna molecules be sequestered in a separate nuclear compartment to protect the genome from damage by the movements of the cytoskeleton modern eukaryotic cells evolved from a symbiosis a predatory way of life helps to explain another feature of eukaryotic cells all such cells contain or at one time did contain mitochondria figure 128 these small bodies in the cytoplasm enclosed by a double layer of membrane take up oxygen and harness energy from the oxidation of food moleculessuch as sugarsto produce most of the atp that powers the cells activities mitochondria are similar in size to small bacteria and like bacteria they have their own genome in the form of a circular dna molecule their own ribosomes that differ from those elsewhere in the eukaryotic cell and their own transfer rnas it is now generally accepted that mitochondria originated from freeliving oxygenmetabolizing aerobic bacteria that were engulfed by an ancestral cell that could otherwise make no such use of oxygen that is was anaerobic escaping digestion these bacteria evolved in symbiosis with the engulfing cell and its progeny receiving and move this membrane it may also require that the cells long fragile dna molecules be sequestered in a separate nuclear compartment to protect the genome from damage by the movements of the cytoskeleton modern eukaryotic cells evolved from a symbiosis a predatory way of life helps to explain another feature of eukaryotic cells all such cells contain or at one time did contain mitochondria figure 128 these small bodies in the cytoplasm enclosed by a double layer of membrane take up oxygen and harness energy from the oxidation of food moleculessuch as sugarsto produce most of the atp that powers the cells activities mitochondria are similar in size to small bacteria and like bacteria they have their own genome in the form of a circular dna molecule their own ribosomes that differ from those elsewhere in the eukaryotic cell and their own transfer rnas it is now generally accepted that mitochondria originated from freeliving oxygenmetabolizing aerobic bacteria that were engulfed by an ancestral cell that could otherwise make no such use of oxygen that is was anaerobic escaping digestion these bacteria evolved in symbiosis with the engulfing cell and its progeny receiving or to swallow up other cells fungi it seems have turned from hunters into scavengers other cells secrete nutrient molecules or release them upon death and fungi feed on these leavingsperforming whatever digestion is necessary extracellularly by secreting digestive enzymes to the exterior eukaryotes have hybrid genomes the genetic information of eukaryotic cells has a hybrid originfrom the ancestral anaerobic archaeal cell and from the bacteria that it adopted as symbionts most of this information is stored in the nucleus but a small amount remains inside the mitochondria and for plant and algal cells in the chloroplasts when mitochondrial dna and the chloroplast dna are separated from the nuclear dna and individually analyzed and sequenced the mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes are found to be degenerate cutdown versions of the corresponding bacterial genomes in a human cell for example the mitochondrial genome consists of only 16569 nucleotide pairs and codes for only 13 proteins 2 ribosomal rna components and 22 transfer rnas many of the genes that are missing from the mitochondria and chloroplasts have not been lost instead they have moved from the symbiont genome into the dna of the host cell nucleus the nuclear dna of humans contains many genes coding for proteins that serve essential functions inside the mitochondria in plants the nuclear dna also contains many genes specifying proteins required in chloroplasts in both cases the dna sequences of these nuclear genes show clear evidence of their origin from the bacterial ancestor of the respective organelle eukaryotic genomes are big natural selection has evidently favored mitochondria with small genomes by contrast the nuclear genomes of most eukaryotes seem to have been free to enlarge perhaps the eukaryotic way of life has made large size an advantage predators typically need to be bigger than their prey and cell size generally increases in proportion to genome size whatever the reason aided by a massive accumulation of dna segments derived from parasitic transposable elements discussed in chapter 5 the genomes of most eukaryotes have become orders of magnitude larger than those of bacteria and archaea figure 132 the freedom to be extravagant with dna has had profound implications eukaryotes not only have more genes than prokaryotes they also have vastly more dna that does not code for protein the human genome contains 1000 times as many nucleotide pairs as the genome of a typical bacterium perhaps 10 times as many genes and a great deal more noncoding dna 985 of the genome for a human does not code for proteins as opposed to 11 of the genome for the bacterium e coli the estimated genome sizes and gene numbers for some eukaryotes are compiled for easy comparison with e coli in table 12 we shall discuss how each of these eukaryotes serves as a model organism shortly eukaryotic genomes are rich in regulatory dna much of our noncoding dna is almost certainly dispensable junk retained like a mass of old papers because when there is little pressure to keep an archive small it is easier to retain everything than to sort out the valuable information and discard the rest certain exceptional eukaryotic species such as the puffer fish bear witness to the profligacy of their relatives they have somehow managed to rid themselves of large quantities of noncoding dna yet they appear similar in structure behavior and fitness to related species that have vastly more such dna see figure 471 even in compact eukaryotic genomes such as that of puffer fish there is more noncoding dna than coding dna and at least some of the noncoding dna certainly has important functions in particular it regulates the expression of adjacent genes with this regulatory dna eukaryotes have evolved distinctive ways of controlling when and where a gene is brought into play this sophisticated gene regulation is crucial for the formation of complex multicellular organisms the genome defines the program of multicellular development the cells in an individual animal or plant are extraordinarily varied fat cells skin cells bone cells nerve cellsthey seem as dissimilar as any cells could be figure 133 yet all these cell types are the descendants of a single fertilized egg cell and all with minor exceptions contain identical copies of the genome of the species the differences result from the way in which the cells make selective use of their genetic instructions according to the cues they get from their surroundings in the developing embryo the dna is not just a shopping list specifying the molecules that every cell must have and the cell is not an assembly of all the items on the list rather the cell behaves as a multipurpose machine with sensors to receive environmental signals and with highly developed abilities to call different sets of genes into action according to the sequences of signals to which the cell has been exposed the genome in each cell is big enough to accommodate the information that specifies an entire multicellular organism but in any individual cell only part of that information is used a large number of genes in the eukaryotic genome code for proteins that regulate the activities of other genes most of these transcription regulators act by binding directly or indirectly to the regulatory dna adjacent to the genes that are to be controlled or by interfering with the abilities of other proteins to do so the expanded genome of eukaryotes therefore not only specifies the hardware of the cell but also stores the software that controls how that hardware is used figure 134 cells do not just passively receive signals rather they actively exchange signals with their neighbors thus in a developing multicellular organism the same control system governs each cell but with different consequences depending on the messages exchanged the outcome astonishingly is a precisely patterned array of cells in different states each displaying a character appropriate to its position in the multicellular structure many eukaryotes live as solitary cells many species of eukaryotic cells lead a solitary lifesome as hunters the protozoa some as photosynthesizers the unicellular algae some as scavengers the unicellular fungi or yeasts figure 135 conveys something of the astonishing variety of the singlecelled eukaryotes the anatomy of protozoa especially is often elaborate and includes such structures as sensory bristles photoreceptors sinuously beating cilia leglike appendages mouth parts stinging darts and musclelike contractile bundles although they are single cells protozoa can be as intricate as versatile and as complex in their behavior as many multicellular organisms see figure 127 movie 14 and movie 15 in terms of their ancestry and dna sequences the unicellular eukaryotes are far more diverse than the multicellular animals plants and fungi which arose as three comparatively late branches of the eukaryotic pedigree see figure 117 as with prokaryotes humans have tended to neglect them because they are microscopic only now with the help of genome analysis are we beginning to understand their positions in the tree of life and to put into context the glimpses these strange creatures can offer us of our distant evolutionary past,eukaryotic cells are significantly larger and more complex than prokaryotic cells with specialized structures that facilitate diverse functions and the formation of multicellular organisms one defining feature is the nucleus a membranebound compartment that houses the cells dna protecting it from cytoplasmic activities the presence of an elaborate cytoskeletona network of protein filamentsprovides mechanical strength shape and mobility mitochondria originating from engulfed aerobic bacteria play a crucial role in energy production converting oxygen and nutrients into atp which powers cellular activities eukaryotic genomes are a hybrid of genetic material from ancestral archaeal cells and symbiotic bacteria with most genetic information stored in the nucleus interestingly eukaryotic cells have vast amounts of noncoding dna much of which serves essential regulatory functions controlling gene expression and cellular activities moreover during development eukaryotic cells can differentiate into various specialized cell types despite having identical genomes this differentiation is regulated by specific proteins that activate particular genes in response to environmental signals thus the complex organization of eukaryotic genomes supports a wide array of life forms and intricate developmental processes crucial for the emergence of multicellular organisms
a yeast serves as a minimal model eukaryote the molecular and genetic complexity of eukaryotes is daunting even more than for prokaryotes biologists need to concentrate their limited resources on a few selected model organisms to unravel this complexity to analyze the internal workings of the eukaryotic cell without the additional problems of multicellular development it makes sense to use a species that is unicellular and as simple as possible the popular choice for this role of minimal model eukaryote has been the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae figure 136the same species that is used by brewers of beer and bakers of bread s cerevisiae is a small singlecelled member of the kingdom of fungi and thus according to modern views is at least as closely related to animals as it is to plants it is robust and easy to grow in a simple nutrient medium like other fungi it has a tough cell wall is relatively immobile and possesses mitochondria but not chloroplasts when nutrients are plentiful it grows and divides almost as rapidly as a bacterium it can reproduce either vegetatively that is by simple cell division or sexually two yeast cells that are haploid possessing a single copy of the genome can fuse to create a cell that is diploid containing a double genome and the diploid cell can undergo meiosis a reduction division to produce cells that are once again haploid figure 137 in contrast with higher plants and animals the yeast can divide indefinitely in either the haploid or the diploid state and the process leading from one state to the other can be induced at will by changing the growth conditions in addition to these features the yeast has a further property that makes it a convenient organism for genetic studies its genome by eukaryotic standards is exceptionally small nevertheless it suffices for all the basic tasks that every eukaryotic cell must perform mutants are available for essentially every gene and studies on yeasts using both s cerevisiae and other species have provided a key to many crucial processes including the eukaryotic celldivision cyclethe critical chain of events by which the nucleus and all the other components of a cell are duplicated and parceled out to create two daughter cells from one the control system that governs this process has been so well conserved over the course of evolution that many of its components can function interchangeably in yeast and human cells if a mutant yeast lacking an essential yeast celldivisioncycle gene is supplied with a copy of the homologous celldivisioncycle gene from a human the yeast is cured of its defect and becomes able to divide normally the expression levels of all the genes of an organism can be monitored simultaneously the complete genome sequence of s cerevisiae determined in 1997 consists of approximately 13117000 nucleotide pairs including the small contribution 78520 nucleotide pairs of the mitochondrial dna this total is only about 25 times as much dna as there is in e coli and it codes for only 15 times as many distinct proteins about 6600 in all the way of life of s cerevisiae is similar in many ways to that of a bacterium and it seems that this yeast has likewise been subject to selection pressures that have kept its genome compact knowledge of the complete genome sequence of any organismbe it a yeast or a humanopens up new perspectives on the workings of the cell things that once seemed impossibly complex now seem within our grasp using techniques described in chapter 8 it is now possible for example to monitor simultaneously the amount of mrna transcript that is produced from every gene in the yeast genome under any chosen conditions and to see how this whole pattern of gene activity changes when conditions change the analysis can be repeated with mrna prepared from mutant cells lacking a chosen geneany gene that we care to test in principle this approach provides a way to reveal the entire system of control relationships that govern gene expressionnot only in yeast cells but in any organism whose genome sequence is known arabidopsis has been chosen out of 300000 species as a model plant the large multicellular organisms that we see around usthe flowers and trees and animalsseem fantastically varied but they are much closer to one another in their evolutionary origins and more similar in their basic cell biology than the great host of microscopic singlecelled organisms thus while bacteria and archaea are separated by perhaps 35 billion years of evolution vertebrates and insects are separated by about 700 million years fish and mammals by about 450 million years and the different species of flowering plants by only about 150 million years because of the close evolutionary relationship between all flowering plants we can once again get insight into the cell and molecular biology of this whole class of organisms by focusing on just one or a few species for detailed analysis out of the several hundred thousand species of flowering plants on earth today molecular biologists have chosen to concentrate their efforts on a small weed the common thale cress arabidopsis thaliana figure 138 which can be grown indoors in large numbers and produces thousands of offspring per plant after 810 weeks arabidopsis has a total genome size of approximately 220 million nucleotide pairs about 17 times the size of yeasts see table 12 the world of animal cells is represented by a worm a fly a fish a mouse and a human multicellular animals account for the majority of all named species of living organisms and for the largest part of the biological research effort five species have emerged as the foremost model organisms for molecular genetic studies in order of increasing size they are the nematode worm caenorhabditis elegans the fly drosophila melanogaster the zebrafish danio rerio the mouse mus musculus and the human homo sapiens each has had its genome sequenced caenorhabditis elegans figure 139 is a small harmless relative of the eelworm that attacks crops with a life cycle of only a few days an ability to survive in a freezer indefinitely in a state of suspended animation a simple body plan and an unusual life cycle that is well suited for genetic studies described in chapter 21 it is an ideal model organism c elegans develops with clockwork precision from a fertilized egg cell into an adult worm with exactly 959 body cells plus a variable number of egg and sperm cellsan unusual degree of regularity for an animal we now have a minutely detailed description of the sequence of events by which this occurs as the cells divide move and change their character according to strict and predictable rules the genome of 130 million nucleotide pairs codes for about 21000 proteins and many mutants and other tools are available for the testing of gene functions although the worm has a body plan very different from our own the conservation of biological mechanisms has been sufficient for the worm to be a model for many of the developmental and cellbiological processes that occur in the human body thus for example studies of the worm have been critical for helping us to understand the programs of cell division and cell death that determine the number of cells in the bodya topic of great importance for both developmental biology and cancer research studies in drosophila provide a key to vertebrate development the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster figure 140 has been used as a model genetic organism for longer than any other in fact the foundations of classical genetics were built to a large extent on studies of this insect over 80 years ago it provided for example definitive proof that genesthe abstract units of hereditary informationare carried on chromosomes concrete physical objects whose behavior had been closely followed in the eukaryotic cell with the light microscope but whose function was at first unknown the proof depended on one of the many features that make drosophila peculiarly convenient for geneticsthe giant chromosomes with characteristic banded appearance that are visible in some of its cells figure 141 specific changes in the hereditary information manifest in families of mutant flies were found to correlate exactly with the loss or alteration of specific giantchromosome bands in more recent times drosophila more than any other organism has shown us how to trace the chain of cause and effect from the genetic instructions encoded in the chromosomal dna to the structure of the adult multicellular body drosophila mutants with body parts strangely misplaced or mispatterned provided the key to the identification and characterization of the genes required to make a properly structured body with gut limbs eyes and all the other parts in their correct places once these drosophila genes were sequenced the genomes of vertebrates could be scanned for homologs these were found and their functions in vertebrates were then tested by analyzing mice in which the genes had been mutated the results as we see later in the book reveal an astonishing degree of similarity in the molecular mechanisms that govern insect and vertebrate development discussed in chapter 21 the majority of all named species of living organisms are insects even if drosophila had nothing in common with vertebrates but only with insects it would still be an important model organism but if understanding the molecular genetics of vertebrates is the goal why not simply tackle the problem headon why sidle up to it obliquely through studies in drosophila drosophila requires only 9 days to progress from a fertilized egg to an adult it is vastly easier and cheaper to breed than any vertebrate and its genome is much smallerabout 200 million nucleotide pairs compared with 3200 million for a human this genome codes for about 15000 proteins and mutants can now be obtained for essentially any gene but there is also another deeper reason why genetic mechanisms that are hard to discover in a vertebrate are often readily revealed in the fly this relates as we now explain to the frequency of gene duplication which is substantially greater in vertebrate genomes than in the fly genome and has probably been crucial in making vertebrates the complex and subtle creatures that they are,yeast specifically saccharomyces cerevisiae is a widely used minimal model eukaryote due to its unicellular structure and simple genome which comprises about 131 million nucleotide pairs it can reproduce both vegetatively and sexually allowing scientists to study the cell cycle and gene functions effectively its genome is small yet sufficient for essential eukaryotic functions making it convenient for genetic studies in plant biology arabidopsis thaliana a small weed serves as a model organism for flowering plants with a genome of approximately 220 million nucleotide pairs for animal studies five species are prominent models the nematode worm caenorhabditis elegans the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster the zebrafish danio rerio the mouse mus musculus and humans homo sapiens these organisms help reveal genetic and developmental mechanisms that are conserved across species with drosophila being particularly valuable for understanding vertebrate development due to its simpler genetics and shorter lifecycle
the vertebrate genome is a product of repeated duplications almost every gene in the vertebrate genome has paralogsother genes in the same genome that are unmistakably related and must have arisen by gene duplication in many cases a whole cluster of genes is closely related to similar clusters present elsewhere in the genome suggesting that genes have been duplicated in linked groups rather than as isolated individuals according to one hypothesis at an early stage in the evolution of the vertebrates the entire genome underwent duplication twice in succession giving rise to four copies of every gene the precise course of vertebrate genome evolution remains uncertain because many further evolutionary changes have occurred since these ancient events genes that were once identical have diverged many of the gene copies have been lost through disruptive mutations some have undergone further rounds of local duplication and the genome in each branch of the vertebrate family tree has suffered repeated rearrangements breaking up most of the original gene orderings comparison of the gene order in two related organisms such as the human and the mouse reveals thaton the time scale of vertebrate evolutionchromosomes frequently fuse and fragment to move large blocks of dna sequence around indeed it is possible as discussed in chapter 4 that the present state of affairs is the result of many separate duplications of fragments of the genome rather than duplications of the genome as a whole there is however no doubt that such wholegenome duplications do occur from time to time in evolution for we can see recent instances in which duplicated chromosome sets are still clearly identifiable as such the frog genus xenopus for example comprises a set of closely similar species related to one another by repeated duplications or triplications of the whole genome among these frogs are x tropicalis with an ordinary diploid genome the common laboratory species x laevis with a duplicated genome and twice as much dna per cell and x ruwenzoriensis with a sixfold reduplication of the original genome and six times as much dna per cell 108 chromosomes compared with 36 in x laevis for example these species are estimated to have diverged from one another within the past 120 million years figure 142 the frog and the zebrafish provide accessible models for vertebrate development frogs have long been used to study the early steps of embryonic development in vertebrates because their eggs are big easy to manipulate and fertilized outside of the animal so that the subsequent development of the early embryo is easily followed figure 143 xenopus laevis in particular continues to be an important model organism even though it is poorly suited for genetic analysis movie 16 and see movie 211 the zebrafish danio rerio has similar advantages but without this drawback its genome is compactonly half as big as that of a mouse or a humanand it has a generation time of only about three months many mutants are known and genetic engineering is relatively easy the zebrafish has the added virtue that it is transparent for the first two weeks of its life so that one can watch the behavior of individual cells in the living organism see movie 212 all this has made it an increasingly important model vertebrate figure 144 the mouse is the predominant mammalian model organism mammals have typically two times as many genes as drosophila a genome that is 16 times larger and millions or billions of times as many cells in their adult bodies in terms of genome size and function cell biology and molecular mechanisms mammals are nevertheless a highly uniform group of organisms even anatomically the differences among mammals are chiefly a matter of size and proportions it is hard to think of a human body part that does not have a counterpart in elephants and mice and vice versa evolution plays freely with quantitative features but it does not readily change the logic of the structure for a more exact measure of how closely mammalian species resemble one another genetically we can compare the nucleotide sequences of corresponding orthologous genes or the amino acid sequences of the proteins that these genes encode the results for individual genes and proteins vary widely but typically if we line up the amino acid sequence of a human protein with that of the orthologous protein from say an elephant about 85 of the amino acids are identical a similar comparison between human and bird shows an amino acid identity of about 70twice as many differences because the bird and the mammalian lineages have had twice as long to diverge as those of the elephant and the human figure 145 the mouse being small hardy and a rapid breeder has become the foremost model organism for experimental studies of vertebrate molecular genetics many naturally occurring mutations are known often mimicking the effects of corresponding mutations in humans figure 146 methods have been developed moreover to test the function of any chosen mouse gene or of any noncoding portion of the mouse genome by artificially creating mutations in it as we explain later in the book just one madetoorder mutant mouse can provide a wealth of information for the cell biologist it reveals the effects of the chosen mutation in a host of different contexts simultaneously testing the action of the gene in all the different kinds of cells in the body that could in principle be affected humans report on their own peculiarities as humans we have a special interest in the human genome we want to know the full set of parts from which we are made and to discover how they work but even if you were a mouse preoccupied with the molecular biology of mice humans would be attractive as model genetic organisms because of one special property through medical examinations and selfreporting we catalog our own genetic and other disorders the human population is enormous consisting today of some 7 billion individuals and this selfdocumenting property means that a huge database of information exists on human mutations the human genome sequence of more than 3 billion nucleotide pairs has been determined for thousands of different people making it easier than ever before to identify at a molecular level the precise genetic change responsible for any given human mutant phenotype by drawing together the insights from humans mice fish flies worms yeasts plants and bacteriausing gene sequence similarities to map out the correspondences between one model organism and anotherwe are enriching our understanding of them all we are all different in detail what precisely do we mean when we speak of the human genome whose genome on average any two people taken at random differ in about one or two in every 1000 nucleotide pairs in their dna sequence the genome of the human species is properly speaking a very complex thing embracing the entire pool of variant genes found in the human population knowledge of this variation is helping us to understand for example why some people are prone to one disease others to another why some respond well to a drug others badly it is also providing clues to our historythe population movements and minglings of our ancestors the infections they suffered the diets they ate all these things have left traces in the variant forms of genes that survive today in the human communities that populate the globe to understand cells and organisms will require mathematics computers and quantitative information empowered by knowledge of complete genome sequences we can list the genes proteins and rna molecules in a cell and we have methods that allow us to begin to depict the complex web of interactions between them but how are we to turn all this information into an understanding of how cells work even for a single cell type belonging to a single species of organism the current deluge of data seems overwhelming the sort of informal reasoning on which biologists usually rely seems totally inadequate in the face of such complexity in fact the difficulty is more than just a matter of information overload biological systems are for example full of feedback loops and the behavior of even the simplest of systems with feedback is remarkably difficult to predict by intuition alone figure 147 small changes in parameters can cause radical changes in outcome to go from a circuit diagram to a prediction of the behavior of the system we need detailed quantitative information and to draw deductions from that information we need mathematics and computers such tools for quantitative reasoning are essential but they are not allpowerful you might think that knowing how each protein influences each other protein and how the expression of each gene is regulated by the products of others we should soon be able to calculate how the cell as a whole will behave just as an astronomer can calculate the orbits of the planets or a chemical engineer can calculate the flows through a chemical plant but any attempt to perform this feat for anything close to an entire living cell rapidly reveals the limits of our present knowledge the information we have plentiful as it is is full of gaps and uncertainties moreover it is largely qualitative rather than quantitative most often cell biologists studying the cells control systems sum up their knowledge in simple schematic diagramsthis book is full of themrather than in numbers graphs and differential equations to progress from qualitative descriptions and intuitive reasoning to quantitative descriptions and mathematical deduction is one of the biggest challenges for contemporary cell biology so far the challenge has been met only for a few very simple fragments of the machinery of living cellssubsystems involving a handful of different proteins or two or three crossregulatory genes where theory and experiment go closely hand in hand we discuss some of these examples later in the book and devote the entire final section of chapter 8 to the role of quantitation in cell biology knowledge and understanding bring the power to intervenewith humans to avoid or prevent disease with plants to create better crops with bacteria to turn them to our own uses all these biological enterprises are linked because the genetic information of all living organisms is written in the same language the newfound ability of molecular biologists to read and decipher this language has already begun to transform our relationship to the living world the account of cell biology in the subsequent chapters will we hope equip the reader to understand and possibly to contribute to the great scientific adventure of the twentyfirst century,model organisms are essential for biological research offering insights into cell function and genetics yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is a prime model eukaryote due to its simple structure and rapid growth facilitating studies on cell division arabidopsis thaliana a model plant has a small genome and quick reproductive cycle making it ideal for genetic research among animal models the nematode worm c elegans and the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster have greatly advanced our understanding of developmental biology the zebrafish danio rerio serves as a model for vertebrate development due to its transparent embryos while the mouse mus musculus is favored in mammalian studies for its genetic similarity to humans and the ability to create specific mutants the human genome benefits from extensive population databases enhancing the understanding of genetic disorders and ancestry due to the complexity of biological systems mathematical and computational tools are vital for analyzing vast amounts of data enabling researchers to decipher intricate cellular interactions overall these model organisms provide invaluable insights that drive advancements in genetics development and disease understanding
structure and mechanics of membrane proteins introduction biological membranes enclose and compartmentalize cells of all organisms acting as effective insulators and selective filters between the cytoplasm and the outside medium composed of a phospholipid double layer each membrane houses particular proteins or protein complexes that provide specific communication channels between the compartments or the cell and its environment lipids and membrane proteins form domains which can vary and adapt to the functional state of the cell 1 2 membrane proteins often arranged in lipidprotein domains are involved in basic cellular activities such as solute and ion transport energy transduction in respiratory and photosynthetic systems or sensory stimuli transduction and information processing hence they are important drug targets although 30 of all genes are known to encode membrane proteins our understanding for this important class of proteins lags behind because of their highly hydrophobic nature their intricate subunit structure and their resistance to assemble into threedimensional crystals suitable for xray analysis both their individual polypeptide composition as well as their specific assembly into larger protein complexes ie their quaternary structure in the membrane are fundamental aspects in the molecular description of their functionality as result of their insolubility in aqueous media the analysis of membrane proteins is notoriously difficult detergent treatment is required for solubilization and purification the latter being a prerequisite for most structural studies yet detergentsolubilized membrane proteins are often unstable and tend to aggregate and they may or may not be in their native conformation methods that allow membrane proteins to be assessed in the native membrane or when reconstituted in a lipid bilayer are thus of interest atomic force microscopes afms are tools to address the surface structure and mechanics of singlemembrane proteins in their native environment ie embedded in the lipid bilayer and immersed in a physiological salt solution 3 not only are the surface structure the supramolecular arrangement and the lateral organization of the proteins revealed but moreover individual proteins may be addressed and investigated in greater detail they may be contacted by the afm tip and subsequently extracted from the membrane 4 the forces that keep the protein in the membrane as well as those that resist unfolding of the protein may thus be studied with unparalleled resolution and sensitivity 5 the unfolding barriers may be localized in the sequence with an accuracy of a few amino acids and the folding energy landscape can be analyzed both in magnitude but also in the dynamics of the response the binding of individual ligands may be visualized and the alterations in the mechanics of the proteins may be detected and localized again with the precision of a few amino acids not only unfolding processes may be followed but also controlled refolding of the proteins into the membrane can be achieved the unfolded polypeptide chain is gradually allowed to sink back into the membrane while the force at which it is pulled into its native environment is recorded nonequilibrium aspects of such foldingunfolding cycles reveal details on kinetics and dynamics of the underlying processes instrumentation invented three decades ago 6 scanning probe microscopes have been applied in many areas and their capabilities have constantly been refined and optimized for specific applications the principle of the afm is simple a sharp tip mounted at the end of a flexible cantilever is raster scanned over a sample surface and the cantilever deflection caused by the probesample interaction is measured via an optical system this signal drives a servosystem that moves the sample vertically to keep the cantilever deflection at a constant value the surface topography is then reconstructed from the vertical movement of the scanner in this mode the probing tip always presses on the surface with a constant force during scanning 7 alternatively the afm tip is oscillated rapidly in the vertical direction while scanning the sample when the tip approaches the sample surface a reduction in the oscillation amplitude is measured and used to control the servosystem the tip oscillation reduces frictional forces thereby minimizing damage and displacement of the sample 8 therefore the oscillating mode is frequently used to image the surface topography of weakly immobilized biomolecules eg single proteins and fibrillar structures an even more sensitive variant of the oscillating mode is the dynamic mode afm whereby frequency shifts of the oscillating cantilever resulting from tipsample interactions are measured and used as a feedback signal for the servosystem 9 the major advantage of all these imaging modes is that they can be executed in fluids thus allowing biological macromolecules to be observed at work progress in instrumentation concerns afms that provide high scan speed 1011a higher force sensitivity 9 and acquisition of multiple signals received simultaneously 12 operation in fluids imposes limitations and brings about technical difficulties first cantilevers that exhibit a qfactor of about 104 in a vacuum and some 102 in air have a qfactor of 10 when operated in solution 13 because the force sensitivity depends on the qfactor such a decrease is critical second the resonance frequency of a cantilever drops by a factor of about five in liquid from its value in a vacuum hence the scan speed must be correspondingly reduced for scanning in liquid third conducting cantilever for measurements of a chemical reaction in solution need to be properly insulated which requires complex microfabrication procedures nevertheless several successful designs toward fast afms have been reported and encouraging results have been published fastscanning afms recording up to 1300 topographs per second may in future help capture the fast dynamics of membrane proteins 1011a 14 moreover progress in scanning electrochemical microscopy secm suggests that electronic activation and direct observation of biological processes at the molecular level are feasible these developments are closely linked to improved cantilever fabrication small cantilevers are key to fast scanning whereas insulated cantilevers with metal tips are needed for highresolution secm highresolution imaging of membrane surfaces several factors affect the spatial resolution achieved by afm first membranes need to be immobilized on a flat supporting surface because a soft membrane adsorbed onto a support will adapt to the modulation of the supporting surface muscovite mica is the most frequently used support in afm cleaving the layered mica crystal provides highly reproducible atomically flat surfaces that allow adsorption of membranes to be tuned by ionic strength and ph 15 16 second highresolution afm imaging of fragile biological surfaces requires precise control of the tipsample interactions and the parameters of the servo system that guide the afm stylus over the object in particular the electrostatic interactions between afm stylus and biological sample must be adjusted to distribute the excess scanning force applied over an area that is perhaps 10 times larger than that of the tip apex itself 17 third to identify a suitable tip requires patience and experience 16 last but not least the instrument must be stable and shielded from vibrations and noise all critical surfaces must be clean and the electronic feedback parameters must be properly adjusted 16,biological membranes composed of phospholipid bilayers function as barriers and selective filters between cells and their environments they contain membrane proteins that form domains to support activities like transport sensory response and energy transfer these proteins are challenging to analyze due to their hydrophobicity and complex structures atomic force microscopy afm enables highresolution study of membrane proteins in their native environment by measuring forces and visualizing interactions at the amino acid level afms scan the surface of proteins and membranes using a sharp tip on a flexible cantilever capturing details on protein folding unfolding and interactions with ligands advanced afm techniques such as dynamic mode afm and highspeed scanning provide insights into membrane protein mechanics offering potential for realtime observation of biological processes
imaging native or reconstituted twodimensional membrane protein crystals purple membranes of halobacterium halobium are ideal objects to explore the capability of an afm and to optimize the imaging conditions these highly specialized membranes are a native twodimensional trigonal lattice assembled from lipids and bacteriorhodopsin the archaeal proton pump an early example 18 is shown in figure 1 which summarizes the capability of an afm to depict and manipulate singlepolypeptide loops that connect the seven transmembrane helical segments constituting the protein under optimized conditions the afm allows a lateral resolution of 05 nm and a vertical resolution of 01 nm to be achieved as demonstrated in several instances 19 the exceptionally high signaltonoise ratio of the afm allows structural details of singlemembrane proteins to be observed and the flexibility of protrusions comprising a small number of amino acid residues to be assessed quantitatively 20 other examples concern halorhodopsin a protein that is related to bacteriorhodopsin 21 and many reconstituted mostly regularly packed membrane proteins highresolution topographies have been acquired on porin ompf 22 23 staphylococcal hemolysin 24 aquaporins 2527 rotors from various f0 atp synthases 2830 and bacterial lightharvesting complexes 31 32 because most of the highresolution topographs were initially achieved on membrane proteins that were crystallized in two dimensions it was thought that a crystalline assembly would be a prerequisite for observing membrane proteins at subnanometer resolution by afm however it was demonstrated that a comparable spatial resolution can be achieved on noncrystalline assemblies of membrane proteins 30 33 suggesting that native membranes might be imaged at high resolution as well imaging native membranes in almost all methods available today to analyze membrane proteins at high resolution the protein needs to be solubilized purified and further processed to be amenable to analysis in this respect the afm is a unique exception as it allows the surfaces of native membranes to be scanned and the protein surfaces to be resolved down to the subnanometer level without dissassembling the biological membrane therefore once this approach was developed the afm quickly provided new insights into the native organization of membrane proteins and their complexes rhodopsin the first breakthrough in imaging native membranes was achieved when disk membranes prepared from mouse retina and deposited on mica could be imaged by an afm at sufficient resolution to identify the native packing arrangement of rhodopsin figure 2a 34 rhopdopsins were found to arrange in rows of dimers thereby providing a platform for interaction with arrestin as well as with the g protein heterotrimer 35 as this finding is in stark contrast to previous measurements on the function of g proteincoupled receptors gpcrs these observations have a significant impact the issue whether gpcrs are active as a monomer or as a higher oligomer is however not resolved crosslinking experiments performed on native disk membranes 36 did not contradict the notion of rhodopsin dimers whereas cysteine scans combined with crosslinking assays on the dopamine d2 receptor provide compelling support for the model derived from the afm topographs 37 functional assays on rhodopsin solubilized by maltoside detergents exhibiting different alkyl chains revealed a 10fold increase in g protein activation when rhodopsin was solubilized as a higher oligomer 38 it emerges from many observations that not only rhodopsin works as a dimer 39 but that gpcrs in general function as homo or even heterodimers 40 41 a notion that is currently challenged by different approaches 42 43 photosynthetic membranes topographs of native membranes acquired by afm have provided new information on the architecture of the photosynthetic apparatus in different photosynthetic bacteria reviewed in reference 32 images of sufficient resolution to see individual subunits have been recorded on membranes from rhodopseudomonas viridis 44 rhodospirillum photometricum 45 rhodobacter sphaeroides 46 rhodobacter blasticus 47 phaeospirillum molischianum 48 and rhodopseudomonas palustris 49 using the atomic structures of individual components atomic models of the lightharvesting and lightdriven protonpumping systems have been established figure 2b 50 which allow energy transfer mechanisms to be scrutinized a fascinating observation concerns the structural changes of the photosynthetic apparatus during chromatic adaptation of r photometricum to highlight and lowlight growth conditions afm images revealed that under normal light levels core complexes gather in membrane domains with 35 lh2 rings per core without being in a fixed regular architecture under lowlight conditions however additional lh2 complexes assemble in paracrystalline antenna domains 51 mitochondrial outer membranes the outer mitochondrial membrane houses specific proteins which facilitate metabolic coupling and signaling between the cytosol and mitochondria this membrane must be tight because stressinduced release of cytochrome c leads to apoptosis a major part of the molecular traffic is mediated by the voltagedependent anion channel vdac a general diffusion pore exhibiting a diameter of 23 nm these porins have a molecular mass of around 30 kda per functional channel and have been found in all eukaryotic organisms for membrane potentials 20 mv vdacs are in a state that has a reduced conductance electron microscopy has shown that these pores form lattices whose unit cells comprised 6 vdacs when native mitochondrial outer membranes were treated by phospholipase a2 52 however only recently has it been possible to reveal these channels directly in the native outer membranes of mitochondria from potato 53 and from yeast 54 in some membrane domains vdacs were found to be packed at high density like bacterial outer membrane porins 54 whereas in other domains vdacs were loosely packed exhibiting single pores and oligomeric clusters comprising two three four and six channels figure 2c 53 of interest is the observation that the frequencymodulated afm mode yielded the best images of vdacs in particular of single pores that were difficult to visualize in contact mode probably as result of lateral friction forces 53 simultaneous acquisition of surface topography and currents the dream of structural physiologists and biophysicists is the simultaneous observation of a current and the conformational changes of the related biomolecular machinery at the singlemolecule level voltage or lowphinduced conformational changes of the extracellular loops were speculated to lead to channel closure for the bacterial outer membrane porin ompf 22 later the phdriven closure of maltoporin was demonstrated by blacklipid membrane experiments 55 and the structure of an open and a closed conformation of porin ompg showed the involvement of extracellular loops 56 however concomitant observation of current and conformational changes have not been possible only recently the fabrication of cantilevers with a conductive tip and insulated lead which are stable in salt solutions and exhibit suitable mechanical properties was established 57 initial experiments demonstrated that the topography of a biological sample and faradaic currents can be acquired simultaneously with a lateral resolution of 38 nm using such cantilevers figure 3 12 they are operated in an electrochemical setup employing a bipotentiostat to monitor redox processes 58 a critical element is the support which should release or accept electrons from a soluble redox couple should be stable over the time required to conduct the redox experiment should be inert to preserve the structure and function of the biomolecule and should be atomically flat for highresolution imaging only a few materials have been found suitable and among them templatestripped au and pt surfaces are probably the best p frederix p bosshart personal communication proteinlipid membranes covering a hole 59 or a nanowell 60 appear to be an interesting alternative to establish an electrochemical gradient for the assessment of membranebound molecular redox machines although highresolution imaging on a lipidembedded membrane protein array will be difficult unfolding of individual membrane proteins advances in singlemolecule force spectroscopy of soluble proteins and cells tethered between a support and a cantilever 61 have stimulated experiments on bacterial surface layers 62 63 and on bacteriorhodopsin 4 as illustrated in figure 4 these experiments not only provided information on the unfolding forces but also revealed the structural changes related to the extraction of a singlemembrane protein using the afm tip as nanotweezer two different strategies for the attachment of individual proteins to the afm tip were reported in singlemolecule force spectroscopy experiments physisorption 64 or covalent bonding via reactive groups 4 physisorption between the tip and protein was found to be initiated when the repulsive tipsample interaction is overcome by increased contact force 65 although details of the underlying mechanisms are unclear the breakdown of the hydration shells of both the protein and the tip is generally believed to be the dominant mechanism that triggers adhesion the finding that physisorbed molecules may withstand pulling forces of several hundred pn before they detach indicates that multiple local interactions based on van der waals forces charge interactions and hydrogen bonds stabilize this contact 66 67 when the nn force regime needs to be probed the proteins must be covalently attached preferably via known natural or sitespecifically introduced reactive amino acids eg cysteins 68 69 the covalent attachment not only allows an extended force range to be explored with the consequence of a prolonged time window for the experiments but it also enables precise and absolute length measurements during the unfolding process 4 for the investigation of membrane proteins both strategies have proven to be useful 4 70 while imaging the membrane proteins at high resolution individual proteins were selected scanning was halted and the selected protein was then contacted by increasing the force beyond the adhesion threshold which was found to differ from system to system but lies typically in the range of 100200 pn upon retracting the tip a force distance trace was recorded as a protocol for the unfolding and extraction process a subsequent imaging of the sample allowed experiments where a singlemembrane protein was extracted to be identified and the corresponding force distance traces to be selected for further analysis see figure 4 with no specific functionalization this analysis showed that proteins were picked up at random positions of the protein surface typically at the loops therefore a detailed analysis required traces to be selected which showed the full length of the unfolded protein identifying those measurements where the protein was picked up at the terminal end of the protein 4 the force distance traces were then sorted by their length and only those traces with the full length of the completely unfolded protein were further analyzed these long traces have exclusively in common that the protein is attached to the tip at the cterminal end an alternative strategy to preselect the attachment site was chosen by introducing a cysteine in the cytoplasmic tail and allowing this group to bind to the goldcoated tip oesterhelt et al 4 reported an increase in the percentage of fulllength traces to 90 however at the price of a reduced image resolution and a drastically decreased lifetime of the tip an additional very interesting issue arose in the discussion on how the load acting on the protein is distributed in the membrane whether those parts of the protein on the opposing side of the membrane locally interact with the supports or whether the membrane bending elasticity is high enough to distribute the force over a larger area were major concerns experiments on multiple membrane stacks unambiguously showed that the stiffness of the membrane is sufficient and that under suitable conditions the adhesion between the lower loops and the supports can be reduced below the force resolution limit 70 as a result a multitude of membrane proteins was investigated by singlemolecule force spectroscopy and the force distance traces provided a richness of novel information that would not have been accessible otherwise 7177,atomic force microscopy afm has enabled the highresolution imaging of native and reconstituted membrane proteins providing valuable structural insights into twodimensional crystals and noncrystalline native membranes the purple membrane of halobacterium halobium composed of lipids and bacteriorhodopsin serves as an exemplary structure revealing afms capability to achieve resolutions as fine as 05 nm laterally and 01 nm vertically this approach has captured details in a variety of proteins including halorhodopsin porin ompf and others across different biological membranes afm studies on native membranes such as rhodopsin arrays from retinal disks reveal arrangements critical for interactions with g proteins and suggest that gpcrs may operate as dimers photosynthetic membranes analyzed from bacteria demonstrate structural changes responsive to light conditions while imaging of mitochondrial outer membranes shows voltagedependent anion channels vdacs packed in highdensity and loose configurations afms innovation includes simultaneous topography and current acquisition allowing detailed observation of conformational changes and redox processes in singlemolecule force spectroscopy afm enables the unfolding of membrane proteins by exerting controlled forces offering insights into their structural resilience by attaching proteins to afm tips via physisorption or covalent bonding researchers capture the unfolding process expanding our understanding of membrane protein mechanics
localizing unfolding barriers in the course of protein unfolding the force that the cantilever exerts on the protein is transmitted along the backbone into the membrane protein the protein is stabilized in its conformation by the interplay between local forces which in their complexity are represented by the potential energy landscape when the protein is pulled upon it is dragged in the 3ndimensional energy landscape along a chosen direction and encounters a barrier which needs to be overcome to continue the unfolding process two contributions act together in this process the external force which is transmitted through the backbone of the already unfolded part of the protein and thermal fluctuations two strategies arise to overcome this barrier force or patience the latter increases the likelihood that thermal fluctuations will overcome the remaining barrier if in addition an external force is applied the barrier will be overcome at lower forces and as a consequence the force needed to overcome the barrier will depend on the rate at which the force is increased 81 82 because the afm allows control of the position of the tip with angstrom precision one strategy to determine the barrier location could be to measure the length of the already unfolded part of the membrane protein and calculate back to the position of the barrier in the primary structure see figure 5b however two effects alter the apparent length of the unfolded protein under load backbone elasticity and thermal fluctuations for an analytical approach a description of the statistical mechanics of the polymer in a thermal bath combined with a local enthalpic elasticity is needed as is discussed below an alternative approach for the localization of the potential barriers which includes all these length scales was opened recently by molecular dynamics calculations under an external force the laboratories of helmuth grubmuller 83 84 and of klaus schulten 85 have pioneered this field and resulted in full atomic representations of the proteins calculated in aqueous ambient solutions important details such as the rupture of hydrogen bonding systems 86 or hierarchies of unbinding events 87 were shown and helped significantly to develop a better understanding of these molecular systems despite the obstacle that the available time window is still limited the calculated and the measured force distance traces converge with increasing computational power and provide hope for a detailed picture of demanding systems eg membrane protein complexes ab initio description of the elasticity of the polypeptide backbone at a given force the elasticity of the covalent bonds in the amino acid backbone gives rise to an increase in its length at the same time thermal fluctuations kick the backbone which on average pulls the cantilever closer to the membrane several models have been developed to quantify this entropic elasticity of unfolded proteins the most commonly used approach is based on the wormlike chain model 88 here the polymer is treated as an elastic rod with bending stiffness thermal fluctuations bend the rod and as a result decrease the endtoend distance of the rod as a consequence a force builds up when the ends are kept at a certain distance with many such elements in series the ensemble average then allows modeling of the forcedistance relation of an unfolded protein alternatively the entropy elasticity was treated in the freely jointed chain model 65 here the conformational freedom of jointed segments with random orientation was calculated as a function of the endtoend distance in the timeaverage the entropic penalties for rare conformations increase the gibbs free energy and give rise to a restoring force for long polymers and moderate distortions from the thermal average both models have been shown to be equivalent descriptions a third more realistic description was introduced by kreuzer at al 89 the freely rotating chain model it allows the free rotation of segments of a fixed length with a certain angle this model comes closest to reality but was solved analytically only recently 90 all purely entropic models were shown to deviate from the measured extensions at higher forces in some instances the chemical nature of the polymeric backbone leaves marked fingerprints 91 92 the backbone elasticity was in a first attempt modeled in a linear approximation with empirically derived segment elasticities these enthalpic terms were added to the entropic description and provided a satisfactory agreement between theory and experiment but required empirical fit parameters some of them like the extremely short persistence length in the combined wormlike chain wlc model lacked stringent rationality netz and coworkers 93 therefore employed ab intitio quantum mechanical methods to calculate the elasticity of the most abundant biopolymer backbones the polyamino acids and the polynucleic acids and compared them with a simple polycarbon backbone for this purpose they computed with increasing levels of accuracy the energies of the different backbone segments for different lengths from the lengthdependent energies they derived the forcedependent extensions and fitted the numerical results with secondorder polynomials both contributions the increase in bond length as well as changes in the bond angles were found to contribute to the elasticities the results are summarized in the graphs in figure 6 the combination of parameterfree ab initio elasticities with the freely rotating chain model which with the knowledge of the hemistry and the rotational degrees of freedom of the segments is also parameter free now provides for a parameterfree fit of the contour length of biopolymers 94 particularly for the unfolding experiments described above this approach allows the series of peaks in the force distance curves to be fitted and the contour lengths of the unfolded stretches of the membrane protein to be determined with this procedure kessler gaub 95 were able to localize the unfolding barriers in bacteriorhodopsin with the precision of 3 amino acids see figure 5a further details on the nature of these barriers were obtained by experiments with a varied force loading rate muller et al 96 ana lyzed the barrier heights and the spontaneous unfolding rates of the major barriers in bacteriorhodopsin they also analyzed the temperature dependence of the unfolding peaks and derived a hierarchy of the thermal stabilities of the corresponding structural elements 97 a more profound analysis of the barriers was recently carried out on the basis of jarzynski equality this seminal theorem links nonequilibrium work functions as they are recorded in these forced unfolding experiments with equilibrium energies their freeenergy reconstruction provided folding energies that ranged from 500 kbt for bacteriorhodopsin to more than 800 kbt for the sodiumproton antiporter 98 unfolding from different ends membrane proteins like bacteriorhodopsin have a preferred orientation the different sides of the membrane make different ends of the membrane protein easily accessible for singlemolecule force spectroscopy the individual structural elements of the protein may be unfolded in reversed order this offers several advantages when one might argue in the first instance that the unfolding barriers are approached from the back side it becomes clear in a more profound analysis that entirely different unfolding pathways are taken when the protein is unfolded from the nand the cterminal ends respectively nevertheless certain barriers eg hydrogen bonds or salt bridges may be highly localized and therefore give rise to a peak in the unbinding force when approached from either side kessler gaub 95 demonstrated this for bacteriorhodopsin which they unfolded from the cytoplasmic and the extracellular sides see figure 7 for each branch of the unfolding trace they fitted an elasticity curve and localized the barrier it is interesting to note that the peak heights of the unfolding forces and thus the apparent barrier height dropped as unfolding increased this is interpreted as decreasing interaction with the proteins local environment because parts of the protein may be extracted already by contrast nonspecific interactions between the tip and sample often camouflage the first few nanometers of the unfolding trace the two sets of traces recorded from the two sides thus contain complementary information a summary of the barrier positions and heights found in bacteriorhodopsin when probed from both sides is sketched in figure 8 surprisingly barriers were located not only in or between those structural elements which are known to be stiff eg helical rods but also in loops that are not well resolved in structural investigations 7177 95 in certain cases the barrier positions were found to coincide with each other when probed from both sides these barriers are of particular interest because they must be stabilized in both directions upstream and downstream in one case the segment of the protein between this given position and the c terminal was already extracted whereas in the other case the segment toward the n terminal was still integrated in the membrane when the barrier was probed,in protein unfolding external force and thermal fluctuations work in tandem to overcome the energy barriers within the proteins potential landscape which stabilize its structure these barriers are encountered as the protein is unfolded by the cantilever force transmitted along its backbone two main strategies exist for barrier resolution applying force or waiting for thermal fluctuations to assist atomic force microscopy afm can measure the unfolded segments length to approximate the barriers position though this length can be distorted by backbone elasticity and thermal movement various models like the wormlike chain wlc freely jointed chain and freely rotating chain models describe the entropic elasticity of the protein though the wlc is most commonly used each model interprets the protein backbones elasticity and the effect of thermal fluctuations differently with newer models attempting to include enthalpic terms for added accuracy molecular dynamics simulations have also advanced our understanding highlighting crucial details like hydrogen bond ruptures these models and experiments allow for precise mapping of unfolding barriers as seen in bacteriorhodopsin studies importantly unfolding from different ends of a protein like bacteriorhodopsin reveals distinct unfolding pathways and barriers providing comprehensive insight into protein stability under force
refolding back into the bilayer with improved instrumentation and sophisticated control strategies the handling of membrane proteins became possible at the level of individual helices the next logical steps were then to allow the proteins to refold into the membrane and to investigate this process as a paradigm for protein folding kedrov et al 99 succeeded to do so with the sodiumproton antiporter and kessler et al 100 refolded individual helices of bacteriorhodopsin figure 9 shows the protocol of such an experiment first bacteriorhodopsin was partially unfolded and then the tip was lowered again allowing the protein to reassemble in the membrane as can be seen at a certain point the protein pulled the cantilever down this means that mechanical work was exerted by the protein against the cantilever see green area under the curve in figure 9 subsequent unfolding confirmed that helices ed were fully refolded however kessler et al also reported that the majority of the folding attempts resulted in an imperfect refolding which they attributed to both the rearrangement of the void in the membrane but also to inadequate drift stability over the prolonged time spans needed for this kind of experiment 100 because such experiments provide both the work of unfolding and the work of refolding they may be the foundation for a future analysis using a more fundamental nonequilibrium theorem the crooks theorem localizing ligand binding the vast majority of prescribed drugs interact with membrane proteins in view of the lack of highresolution structural data novel approaches to quantify and localize ligand binding to these proteins are needed energy barriers may not only be signatures of the intramolecular bonds they may also be modulated by the interaction of ligands with the protein with the option to localize such barriers with the precision of a few amino acids an attempt to screen the potential landscape of the protein for signatures of ligand interaction seems not only feasible but moreover highly attractive the lab of daniel muller 74 demon strated for the first time that this is possible and the results are shown in figure 10 they unfolded the sodiumproton antiporter in its active and its inactive state as can be seen an additional peak appears at an extension of roughly 65 nm upon activation in neutral ph this can be attributed to a novel barrier around aa 225 which is located in the middle of helix v a functional inhibition by 40 m 2 aminopyrimidine however results in the formation of a new barrier at around aa 85 which is located in the loop between helix x and xi the authors interpret this unexpected finding with a ligandinduced stabilization of the loop which together with other parts of the protein may form the binding pocket this pioneering experiment opens the path for more ligands and binding pockets to be identified in the long list of healthrelevant membrane proteins when no highresolution structural information is available perspectives the afm is currently the only instrument that allows the structure and dynamics of membrane protein surfaces to be assessed under physiological conditions at a lateral resolution of 05 nm and a vertical one of 01 nm highresolution imaging of surfaceexposed loops allows the dynamics of membrane proteins to be monitored at subnanometer level 20 new avenues emerge for assessing not only the surface topography at high spatial resolution but also the local electronic properties of singlemembrane proteins 12 nanomanipulation of membrane protein surfaces and protein unfolding at the singlemolecule level have been fully documented and protocols for such experiments are well established 16 101 protein unfolding experiments can now be analyzed quantitatively and understood to the singleamino acid level 5 74 95 100 and provide indirect information on the threedimensional atomic structure of the addressed proteins and their interaction with ligands adjacent proteins and lipids all these emerging data are not only complementary to structural information from crystallography and nmr spectroscopy but often they are the only structural data available when related proteins are not amenable to conventional highresolution structural analyses recent advances in highresolution imaging of native membranes 34 53 54 102 103 suggest exciting applications of afm technology for the study of biological systems this development fosters great expectations for future progress in assessing membrane proteins in their native environment by afm identifying specific proteins by their surface structure and assessing their nanomechanical as well as electronic properties in situ,recent advancements in atomic force microscopy afm have enabled the refolding of membrane proteins allowing researchers to study the folding process in detail kedrov et al successfully refolded the sodiumproton antiporter while kessler et al partially unfolded bacteriorhodopsin and allowed it to refold this process revealed that certain helices could completely refold though imperfect refolding often occurred due to membrane void rearrangements and drift instability this approach allows researchers to measure both unfolding and refolding work potentially using principles like the crooks theorem for more comprehensive analyses afm has also been applied to investigate ligand interactions with membrane proteins for example mllers lab demonstrated that activating the sodiumproton antiporter introduces a new energy barrier detectable in the forceextension trace signifying ligand binding effects this research opens new pathways for identifying ligand binding sites in medically relevant proteins even when highresolution structural data is unavailable afm remains the only technology capable of providing such detailed protein analysis at the singlemolecule level it enables highresolution mapping of membrane protein structures and dynamics under nearphysiological conditions offering complementary data to traditional crystallography and nmr spectroscopy these advancements hold promise for indepth studies of membrane protein functionality ligand interactions and electronic properties
biology and identification of dengue vectors vector biology identification and study of the bionomics and ecology of dengue vectors are of paramount importance in targeting vector control interventions for dengue prevention and control this chapter discusses the life cycle and key external morphological characters for identification of different stages of the life cycle of dengue vector mosquitoes ae aegypti and ae albopictus 21 life cycle of ae aegypti and ae albopictus the life cycle has 4 distinct stages viz egg larva pupa and adult fig 21 the first three stages are aquatic and the adult is terrestrial the time taken to complete the life cycle is usually 710 days depending on the environmental factors eggs the female mosquito lays eggs oviposit singly on damp inner surface of wet containers above the water level preferably with clear water the eggs are smooth long ovoid shaped and about 1mm long when first laid the eggs appear white but within minutes they turn shiny black within about 2 days the eggs hatch to larvae the eggs can withstand dry weather conditions and retain viability for up to six months or longer larva the larva undergoes 4 stages of development namely 1st 2nd 3rd and 4 th instar larvae fig 22 developing larvae feed on organic matter contained in the water except late 4th instar larva which is a non feeding stage all the larval instar stages are mobile with a characteristic s shape movement of the body at the end of larval period of 4 5 days the 4th instar larva develops into a pupa the mosquito larval body consists of three major parts viz head thorax and abdomen fig23 pupa the pupa is comma shaped and mobile this stage is the final aquatic stage of the mosquitos life cycle and it develops into adult mosquito within 12 days pupa is a non feeding stage pupal body consists of two major parts namely cephalothorax and abdomen fig 24 the density of pupae is a crude proxy to the adult mosquito density adult adult aedes mosquitoes are small to mediumsized approximately 4 7 mm dark in colour with white markingsbands on the body fig 25 the adult life span longivity can range from 02 04 weeks depending on environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity 22 characteristic features of aedes anopheles and culex mosquitoes the major differences between aedes that includes vectors of dengue chikungunya and zika anopheles that includes vector of malaria and culex that includes vectors of filariasis and japanese encephalitis are shown in table 21 aedes mosquitoes can be differentiated from anopheles and culex mosquitoes by the external morphological features ornamentation and resting positions of this genus at different stages of the life cycle adult male mosquitoes of all three genera can be differentiated from females as the males have a pair of plumose bushy antennae and female mosquitoes bear pilose less hairy antennae table21 the life cycles of aedes anopheles and culex mosquitoes can be differentiated at various stages by distinct characteristics egg stage aedes mosquitoes lay black eggs singly on damp surfaces above the water level in wet containers anopheles mosquitoes lay their eggs singly on the water surface with each egg having lateral floats culex mosquitoes however lay their eggs as a raft that floats on the waters surface and lacks lateral floats larval stage aedes larvae have fewer body hairs and a short barrelshaped siphon with a single pair of siphonal tufts they lack palmate hairs and tergal plates on the abdominal segments and rest at an angle to the water surface anopheles larvae are more densely haired lack a siphon and feature palmate hairs and tergal plates they rest parallel to the water surface culex larvae like aedes have a siphon though it is longer and slender with multiple pairs of siphonal tufts they lack palmate hairs and tergal plates and also rest at an angle to the water pupal stage aedes and culex pupae possess long slender breathing trumpets with narrow openings and lack abdominal spines on segments 2 to 7 in contrast anopheles pupae have shorter wider breathing trumpets and small peglike spines on segments 2 or 3 through 7 adult stage both sexes aedes adults rest nearly parallel to the surface displaying black and white scales on their bodies and legs in distinct patterns anopheles adults rest at an angle of 50 to 90 to surfaces with dark and pale scales on their wing veins arranged in distinct blocks culex adults also rest parallel to surfaces with wing vein scales usually all brown or blackish without block arrangements adult stage females female aedes and culex mosquitoes have palpi much shorter than the proboscis whereas female anopheles mosquitoes have palpi as long as the proboscis adult stage males male aedes and culex mosquitoes have palpi longer than the proboscis with aedes palpi tapering at the tips male anopheles mosquitoes also have palpi as long as the proboscis though their tips are clubshaped swollen 23 identification of ae aegypti and ae albopictus in sri lanka 48 aedes meigen species belonging to 11 subgenera have been reported where as over 900 aedes species are identified worldwide ae aegypti and ae albopictus belong to the subgenus stegomyia theobald of the genus aedes in sri lanka in addition to these two species 4 other aedes species belong to this subgenus as shown in fig 26 different stegomyia species can be identified by external morphological characters both at the larval and adult stages using available identification keys however ae aegypti and ae albopictus larvae can be identified by the shape of comb scales on the 8th abdominal segment of the body the adult stages of these two species can be differentiated by the colour patterns ornamentation of white scales on the body table 22 the larvae and adult stages of aedes aegypti and aedes albopictus mosquitoes have distinct identifying characteristics larval stage the abdominal segment of ae aegypti larvae possesses comb scales with lateral denticles while ae albopictus larvae have comb scales without lateral denticles adult stage in ae aegypti adults the mesonotum features a pair of lateral lyreshaped white markings along with submedian yellowish lines in contrast ae albopictus adults have a mesonotum marked by a single narrow white stripe running longitudinally from the anterior margin to the level of the wing root,dengue vector control relies heavily on understanding the biology and ecology of aedes aegypti and aedes albopictus mosquitoes these vectors undergo four life stages egg larva pupa and adult eggs are laid on damp surfaces above water can withstand dry conditions for up to six months and hatch into larvae within two days larvae progress through four instars feeding on organic matter and moving in an s shape pupae the final aquatic stage are nonfeeding and transform into adults within 12 days aedes mosquitoes are identifiable by distinct morphological features across life stages differing from anopheles and culex mosquitoes which carry malaria and other diseases for example aedes larvae have a short siphon and rest at an angle to the water while aedes adults display unique white patterns on their bodies the larvae and adults of ae aegypti and ae albopictus can further be differentiated by comb scale structure and mesonotum color patterns respectively
vector bionomics behaviour knowledge on the bionomics behaviour of ae aegypti and ae albopictus is important for dengue vector control this chapter describes oviposition breeding sites resting and feeding habits flight range of ae aegypti and ae albopictus 31 common oviposition sites breeding habitats of dengue vectors the dengue vectors are container breeders they breed in a wide variety of artificial and natural wet containersreceptacles preferably with dark coloured surfaces and holding clear unpolluted water dengue vector breeding sites are found within and outside houses premises at ground level as well as above ground level in places such as roof gutters overhead tanks and receptacles on slabs and in small and large containersegold tyres place on roofs these containers are found at any type of premises including houses offices hospitals garages commercial sites yards containing automobile parts schools religious places cemeteries bare lands construction sites and plant nurseries furthermore water holding discarded containers along river and stream banks railway lines are also possible breeding sites of ae aegypti and ae albopictus however in some instances the breeding sites are area specificegshallow cemented wells in batticaloa and jaffna ae aegypti prefers to oviposit in artificial containers this species is a skip ovipositor thus a single female mosquito lays eggs in a number of containers in a single oviposition cycle although ae albopictus is considered as a sylvatic species and breeds in natural containers such as leaf axils and tree holes it also breeds in artificial containers in urban and periurban areas ae aegypti shares its habitat with other aedes species including ae albopictus non aedes species and occasionally with some anopheles species the most common breeding sites of ae aegypti and ae albopictus in sri lanka can be classified broadly into a discarded receptacles plastic containers tins clay pots yoghurt and ice cream cups bottles cans damaged ceramic items coconut shells etc b water storage containers water storage cement tanks barrels and other containers c automobile tyres and machinery parts d building structures roof gutters concrete slabs etc e household institutional appliances refrigerator trays flower vases ornamental ponds non functional cisterns and squatting pans of wash rooms f other artificial breeding sites abandoned boats cemeteries etc g natural breeding sites leaf axils tree holes 32 indoor and outdoor breeding sites of dengue vectors dengue vectors breeding sites are found both indoors and outdoors common indoor and outdoor breeding sites of ae aegypti and ae albopictus are 321common indoor breeding sites refrigerator trays flower vases ornamental ponds water storage tanks containers in the toilets bathrooms kitchens etc non functional cisterns and squatting pans of toilets ant traps abandoned fish tanks lift wells in partly constructed buildings 322commom outdoor breeding sites discarded containers ground level and on concrete slabs water storage tanks and barrels shallow cemented wells and manhole service pits ornamental ponds tyres flower pots bamboo stumps coconut shells roof gutters poles in fences leaf axils and tree holes cemented floors unused items and damaged equipment iron poles used to earth electricity building materials in construction sites temporarily removed items covering items plastic polythene sheed pet feeder 34 vector behaviour in this section resting and feeding behaviour and the flight range of dengue vector are discussed 341 resting ae aegypti primarily rests inside houses or buildings in dark and humid surroundings on secluded hanging objects including curtains clothes shoes bed nets underside of furniture and empty containers less often this species is found outdoors in vegetation or other hidden places ae albopictus generally rests outdoors in vegetation empty containers such as pots and tyres and in other hidden places 342 feeding female ae aegypti is highly anthropophilic and it tends to feed on more than one person for a full blood meal multiple feeder this species shows gonotrophic discordance takes more than one blood meal to complete the gonotrophic cycle this multiple feeding habit and gonotrophic discordant behaviour increases the humanbiting rate and thereby greatly increases the epidemic transmission efficiency ae albopictus is an aggressive feeder and takes a full blood meal in one go it is a concordant takes one blood meal to complete the gonotrophic cycle species and therefore considered a less efficient vector dengue vectors are primarily day time biters with two peaks of biting activity ie one in the morning for few hours after day break dawn and the other in the afternoon for few hours before dark dusk the morning peak of biting activity falls between 0600 1100 hours and the afternoon peak falls between 1500 1900 hours however the actual peaks of biting activity may vary slightly within these ranges depending on the location and season of the year these vector species may bite humans in between these peaks especially in shady places and when the light and dark conditions are conducive for their activity these species generally do not bite at night although some may feed at night in well lit rooms 343 egg laying pattern female ae aegypti mosquito produces on average 100 to 200 eggs per batch the females can produce up to five batches of eggs during its lifetime eggs are laid singly the female mosquito will not lay the entire clutch at once at a single site but rather spread out the eggs over many sites over several hours depending on the availability of suitable surfaces eggs will most often be placed at varying distances above the water line 344 flight range and dispersal of adult dispersal of adult female depends on the availability of oviposition sites and human hosts to feed on generally the dispersal is short the horizontal dispersal usually being about 100 200m from the breeding site however when oviposition sites and or human hosts are not available dispersal may be wider as much as 400m vertically these species are found up to many floors in multi storied buildings including condominiums,understanding the behavior bionomics of aedes aegypti and aedes albopictus mosquitoes is critical for effective dengue control both species are container breeders preferring various artificial and natural wet containers with clear water for egglaying ae aegypti mainly lays eggs in artificial containers skipping between multiple sites in a single cycle while ae albopictus is more sylvatic but also utilizes urban containers resting and feeding habits ae aegypti typically rests indoors in dark humid areas eg on curtains furniture undersides whereas ae albopictus rests mostly outdoors on vegetation or containers both species are daytime feeders with peak activity at dawn 06001100 and dusk 15001900 ae aegypti feeds on multiple hosts gonotrophic discordance enhancing transmission efficiency while ae albopictus is a singlemeal feeder making it less efficient in transmission egglaying and dispersal ae aegypti lays eggs in multiple sites per batch averaging 100200 eggs and deposits them above water lines to maximize survival the usual flight range is 100200m but can extend to 400m in search of breeding sites or hosts they can disperse vertically across floors in tall buildings
dengue vector surveillance vector surveillance is the analysis and interpretation of systematically collected entomological data for facilitating appropriate decisions on vector control vector surveillance is an important and essential component of the dengue control programme as the information generated from vector surveillance guides the vector control programme and helps for early warning and epidemic forecasting 41 objectives of dengue vector surveillance to determine the breeding sites of dengue vector mosquitoes to describe the temporal and spatial distribution of vector mosquitoes to describe seasonal fluctuations of vector population to determine feeding and resting habits of vector mosquitoes vector bionomics behaviour to forecast outbreaks and early warning to determine the effectiveness of vector control interventions used for dengue vector control 42 types of dengue vector surveillance dengue vector surveillance is carried out at regularly at sentinel sites and or routine sites surveillance at spots spot checks is carried out in special localities and circumstances based on environmental and epidemiological information 421 sentinel site surveillance sentinel site dengue vector surveillance is a surveillance system in which regular entomological surveys are carried out in prearranged and designated areas to collect entomological data that are useful to make trend observations on vector density dynamics of vector breeding sites changes in vector behaviour and monitoring vector susceptibility resistance status to insecticides that are used in dengue vector control sentinel site vector surveillance facilitates early warning and forecasting of dengue outbreaks criteria for selection of sentinel sites a sentinel sites are identified at district level and monitored monthly it is recommended that a minimum of 02 one urban one semi urban or rural sentinel sites per district to be established and monitored b sentinel site should be i an area where dengue transmission highrisk of transmission is present over a period of time or ii an epidemic prone area areas experiencingpotential for periodic or seasonal outbreaks it may be a cluster of municipal wards grama niladari areas or a public health inspector area c in a sentinel site adjacent municipal wards grama niladari areas having more or less homogeneous prevalence of ae aegypti and reported dengue cases for the past 35 years should be selected for entomological surveillance entomological techniques to be carried out in sentinel site surveillance larval surveys pupal surveys indoor and outdoor adult mosquito resting collections human bait collections using the double net method insecticide susceptibility resistance tests bioefficacy tests for larvae and adult ae aegypti and ae albopictus 422 routine site surveillance routine vector surveillance is a surveillance method in which regular entomological surveys are carried out in high dengue transmission transmission risk areas localities to collect entomological data that are useful to guide dengue vector control activities and for epidemic prevention larval larvae and pupae surveys are the commonly used entomological surveillance method in routine vector surveillance monitoring of larval density helps to identify i potential dengue transmission areas and seasons well ahead of the outbreak period and ii area and time specific vector breeding sites that facilitate application of most appropriate and costeffective vector control interventions criteria for selection of routine surveillance sites a routine surveillance sites are identified at the district or sub districtmedical officer of healthmoh level and monitored regularly ideal if monitored fortnightly otherwise at least monthly b routine surveillance site is i an area where dengue transmission high risk of transmission is present over a period of 3 years or ii an epidemic prone area epidemic prone areas include the areas that are subjected to frequent or seasonal outbreaks epidemics areas with increased vector breeding sites due to development activities urbanization interruptions of regular water supply etc entomological techniques to be performed in routine surveillance site larval surveys fortnightlymonthly insecticide susceptibility resistance tests once in 6 months and bioefficacy tests for larvae and adult ae aegypti and ae albopictus once in 6 months 423 spot checks spot check is a surveillance method that is carried out to generate entomological information for a particular locality for guiding the vector control activities in that localitysite spot checks are carried out in an areas where there are outbreaks of dengue in spite of regular vector control interventions in contact places of reported dengue cases in highrisk institutions such as schools bus depots public places hospitals religious places areas where development projects are carried out and construction sites etc in new areas where dengue cases are reported in an area where there is an increase in the reporting of fever suspected dengue cases when environment changes occur favouring vector breeding eg flooding development projects etc when there is a need to evaluate the impact of control measures eg cleaning programmes fogging etc to identify the new establishment of aedes aegypti or aedes albopictus in areas where there were no reports of the vector previously entomological techniques to be performed during spot checks larval surveys indoor and outdoor adult mosquito resting collection bioefficacy tests for larvae and adult ae aegypti and ae albopictus in order to carry out dengue vector surveillance more efficiently it is important to define priority areas for surveillance 43 priority areas for dengue vector surveillance dengue is a focal and local disease intensity season and localities of dengue transmission epidemics depends on the temporal and spatial prevalence and density of the vectors primarily ae aegypti therefore knowledge on the temporal and spatial distribution of dengue vectors is important for prevention and control of dfdhf transmission however to work with the limited manpower and the logistics of the dengue control programme priority areas need to be identified for vector surveillance the following criteria are used for setting priorities priority 1 2 and 3 for vector surveillance the criteria for setting priorities in dengue vector surveillance are based on locality type type of survey and survey frequency priority i this includes dengueendemic areas where endemicity is defined by local case data such as more than a specific number n of indigenous cases reported per week in the moh area over the past three years both sentinel and routine surveillance are conducted monthly in these areas additionally receptive or vulnerable areas for dengue transmission fall under priority i including locations with rising reports of fever or suspected dengue cases even in areas experiencing outbreaks despite regular vector control efforts this category also includes premises such as hospitals schools construction sites bus depots hostels condominiums camps public places religious venues new development projects areas with migrant populations and sites of large public gatherings like processions or religious events spot checks are conducted in these areas as needed priority ii this category covers localities with recent or current outbreaks within the last three years routine surveillance is conducted monthly in these areas priority iii these are localities with no indigenous dengue cases but with potential transmission risk such as areas with imported dengue cases or low aedes mosquito indices spot checks are carried out biannually in these regions 43 sampling procedures and sample size in dengue vector surveillance the number of premises sampling units to be inspected in a locality depends on the level of precision required the total number of houses in the area and the surveillance method use of a proper sampling method would minimize the bias in the selection of premiseshouses following sampling methods can be used in selection of houses in dengue vector larval surveys at least 100 premises should be surveyed to calculate the vector indices 441 simple random sampling in simple random sampling houses premises to be surveyed are selected using a list of random numbers either from the random number tables or from the computergenerated number this method would require detailed house lists or location maps for identifying selected houses 442 systematic sampling systematic sampling of every nth house throughout a community or along a street for example in an area of 400 premises if a sample of 25 of the house of 400 houses to be inspected every 4th house 4004 would be inspected 443 stratified random sampling the area intended to be surveyed is stratified to a few strata each is more or less epidemiologically homogeneous houses survey units are selected from each stratum randomly for the survey 444 cluster sampling the survey area is divided into several clusters of a fixed number of houses eg each cluster of 100 houses a set of clusters are randomly selected and a randomly selected sample of houses from each cluster is surveyed note frequent and regular visit to a sentinel surveillance site would result in low vector density indices over time thus the houses in the sample should be changed in subsequent visits 45 commonly used entomological techniques for dengue vector surveillance larval surveys both larvae and pupae are the most commonly used survey technique in dengue vector surveillance pupal and adult surveys and oviposition traps are used in special studies and for research purposes 451 larval surveys in larval surveys the basic sampling unit is the house or premise during the larval survey all potential dengue vector breeding sites that are in and around the selected houses premises 100 m around the reported case or designated number of houses should be examined for aedes larvae following equipment should be carried for the larval survey fig41 dippers plastic and aluminium pipettes vials and labels torch to use when dipping storage tanks inside the houses siphoning pipette strainer relevant format from each aedes larvae pupae positive container a minimum of 10 larvae and 10 pupae if present are collected by dipping pipetting andor siphoning fig 41 in instances where 10 larvae pupae are not present all larvae pupae are collected since mixed breeding habitat sharing of aedes and non aedes species is common in sri lanka collection of only one larvae results in underestimating of the vector density the collected larvae are placed in a labelled plastic vial labelled with date location and code number and the species are identified in the laboratory using standard identification keys details of the larval collection should be recorded in the larval survey forms annexure i daily dengue entomological survey details of positive potential premises and containers type of breeding places are recorded in annexure ii breeding places check list it is important to note that if there are multiple breeding sites of the same type in one place eg heaps of tyres coconut shells larvae should be collected at least from 10 randomly selected such containers daily summary report should be given to the relevant moh areas according to the annexure iii format daily dengue entomological survey summary report larval collection by dipping suggested to use a strainer rather than the dipper for larval survey of water storage tanks and barrels as the larvae specially aedes immerse and rest in the bottom of the tank for a long time without coming to the surface after first dip is taken,dengue vector surveillance dengue vector surveillance involves the systematic collection and analysis of entomological data to guide vector control efforts it plays a crucial role in the dengue control program by providing information for early warnings and epidemic forecasting objectives include identifying mosquito breeding sites monitoring the temporal and spatial distribution of vector populations assessing seasonal fluctuations and evaluating vector control interventions types of surveillance include sentinel site surveillance regular surveys in designated areas to track vector density and resistance to insecticides routine site surveillance conducted in highrisk areas primarily through larval surveys to identify potential transmission sites spot checks targeted investigations in areas experiencing outbreaks or environmental changes favoring vector breeding priority areas are classified into three levels based on endemicity and transmission risk with priority i involving endemic areas and priority iii encompassing areas with no recent cases but potential risk effective sampling methods such as random and systematic sampling are essential for accurate data collection larval surveys are the most commonly used technique focusing on potential breeding sites within close proximity to reported cases
larval identification third and fourth instar larvae can be identified at the laboratory immediately after the field survey however 1st and 2nd instar larvae should be allowed to develop to 3rd and 4th instar larvae and identified pupae is allowed to develop to adults and identified 47 calculation of larval density indices the relevant format should be used for reporting annexure iv dengue entomological surveillance report once identification of larvae pupae is completed larval density indices are calculated for ae aegypti alone ae albopictus alone and for ae aegypti and ae albopictus combined in order to determine the vector density in the area if a particular container is positive for both ae aegypti and ae albopictus mixed breeding this particular container is considered as two containers 01 for ae aegypti and 01 for ae albopictus when calculating vector density indices separately for ae aegypti and ae albopictus 471 larval density indices three indices viz container index ci housepremise index hi or pi index and breteau index bi are used to give vector larval density the method of calculation of these indices with examples is given below by definition bi is the number of positive containers for ae aegypti ae albopictus larvae and or pupae per 100 houses premises inspected thus inspection of at least 100 houses is necessary to calculate bi in a particular area an example for calculating the larval density indices using hypothetical data are shown in tables 42 and 43 472 importance and interpretation of larval indices in dengue prevention and control all three larval density indices especially of ae aegypti need to be considered high container index indicates the important container types a dengue vector breeding sites and the vector control interventions need to be directed to eliminate such types of containers immediately these larval indices are important for decision making on elimination of the most common habitats developing educational messages and orientation of communitybased initiatives however it is difficult to give a single countrywide cutoff point of larval density indices as the larval productivity depends on the area container types and the most productive container types in sri lanka hi and bi ae aegypti 3 is an indication for dengue outbreaks and for application of appropriate dengue vector prevention control interventions 473 limitations of larval indices container index provides information on the percentage of wet containers that are positive for dengue vectors and the most important container types house index provides information on the percentage of houses that are positive for vector species and the breteau index provides information on the number of positive containers per 100 houses the larval density indices are a crude indication of adult production for example the larval productivity of a water storage tank is likely to differ markedly from that of a discarded coconut shell however in the calculation of ci hi or bi productivity of these containers is not considered instead it is taken as positive or negative for vector breeding thus the transmission potential of dengue may be quite different in localities with similar larval indices but with different container profiles 474 reporting and communication of larval survey results standard entomological surveillance formats for daily and weekly reporting of surveillance data are given in annexures i and iv respectively format for reporting of surveillance at the institutions construction sites etc is given in annexure v the daily report is an interim report which has to be submitted to the respective medical officer of health moh after the days work annexure iii breeding places check list mentioned in annexure ii although format iv is for weekly reporting of surveillance data separate sheets of format iv should be used if more than one survey locality is surveyed within a week the weekly reports should be submitted to the moh regional malaria officer rmo moicafu entomologist and regional epidemiologist re of the district and the national dengue control unit in colombo 48 pupal surveys since adult mosquito production from different types of containers may vary an estimate of relative adult production can be made based on the pupal density pupal index number of pupae per 100 housespremises pupal index number of pupae in all containers number of houses premises inspected x 100 pupal index can be determined by pupal counts in different types of containers separately giving the relative importance of different types eg tyres water storage tanks etc this information is useful for targeted elimination of the most productive containers making pupal counts is labour intensive and has practical difficulties hence this method is not used for sentinelroutine surveys but may be reserved for special studies and research 49 adult surveys adult vector surveys provide information on the seasonal trends of mosquito density peaks of biting activity resting places potential dengue transmission areas transmission risk and the effectiveness of vector control interventions objectives of adult vector surveys to estimate the adult vector populations in a locality to determine seasonal fluctuations of vector density to study vector behaviour such as biting times and resting places to determine the effectiveness of vector control interventions including evaluation of larvicidal and adulticiding interventions adult vector survey methods include human landing collections human bait collections using double nets indoor and outdoor resting collections 491 humans landing collections landing collections on humans are a sensitive means of detecting the number of infestations of ae aegypti and ae albopictus in an area presence of males in the collection indicates the presence of larval habitats in close by areas in landing collections the adult mosquitoes landing on the bare legs below the knees are collected using test tubes or a sucking tube the data are summarized to determine the number of female aeaegyptiae albopictus mosquitoes landing per human bait per hour number of mosquitoes collected per man hour human landing collections are conducted both indoors and outdoors between 06001800hrs as dengue vector mosquitoes are day time biters in the absence of prophylaxis for dengue every effort should be made to collect female mosquitoes before they begin to bite furthermore this method is done only in dengue non endemic periods during endemic periods human bait collections using double net traps method is more suitable human landing rate number of female aeaegyptiae albopictus mosquitoes number of man hours x100 492 human bait collections using double net traps human bait collection using a double net method can be used for adult vector surveys in this method a human bait is allowed to rest on a folding bed inside the inner mosquito proof net and another net is arranged around this net the outer net is arranged in such a way to keep a space of about 6 inches between the lower edge of the net and the ground and with sufficient space between the two nets for moving a mosquito collector between the two nets the mosquito collector collects the mosquitoes attracted to the bait the adult mosquitoes trapped between the two nets using a sucking tube or a battery powered aspirator mosquito collections are made hourly during the collection period and the mosquito density is given as the a number of adult ae aegypti and ae albopictus mosquitoes per trap and b number of adult mosquitoes per bait per hour 493 indoor resting collections of dengue vectors adult dengue vector mosquitoes rest indoors on hanging objects such as clothes closets and other sheltered places such as inside empty containers and domiciliary objects in resting collections sites are checked for adult mosquitoes with the aid of a flashlight mosquitoes are collected using mouth or battery powered aspirators fig 47 the flying mosquitoes are collected using sweep nets fig 48 battery operated aspirators and backpack aspirators are also used in collections of indoor and outdoor resting mosquitoes fig 49 in resting collections mosquito density is given as the number of adult mosquitoes collected per man hour of collection adult mosquito density no of vector mosquitoes collected no of man hours spent surveys of adult mosquitoes are time consuming and labour intensive less practical in routine surveillance when the collection technique involves human baits extreme care should be taken to prevent him from mosquito bites 494 oviposition traps oviposition traps commonly referred to as ovitraps are used to detect the presence of ae aegypti and ae albopictus when and where the other vector density indices larval and adult densities are low objectives and uses of ovitrap collections to assess dengue vector density when and where larval surveys produce low vector indices eg when the bi ae aegypti is 3 to detect new areas of infestations of dengue vectors early to determine the effectiveness efficacy of vector control interventions to collect eggs of dengue mosquitoes for susceptibility and bioefficacy tests to assess vector population fluctuation over longterm the standard ovitrap is a widemouthed plastic cup of approximately 250 ml which is painted in black on the outside to attract the ae aegypti ae albopictus females to oviposit a piece of hardboard or a wooden paddle is placed diagonally inside the cup as an oviposition substrate and the cup is partially filled with clean water to provide the right ovipositing medium for the female mosquito hay infusion attracts culex and armigeres mosquitoes thus tap water is preferred for the ovitraps instead of the wooden paddle white towelling of filter paper strips can be placed inside the cup and attached by paper clips fig 410 the ovitraps are placed appropriately in a suspected mosquito frequenting place both indoors and outdoors collection of ovitraps is made once in 3 5 days and the paddles paper strips are examined under a dissecting microscope for the presence of eggs of aedes the numbers of eggs are counted to give the egg density as a the number of eggs per ovitrap and b the percentage of positive ovitraps in areas where both ae aegypti and ae albopictus are present eggs should be allowed to hatch and then the larvae or adults should be identified since the eggs of both species cannot be reliably distinguished from each other a number of eggs per trap total number of eggs total number of ovitraps installed b percentage of positive ovitraps ovitrap index oi noof positive ovitraps noof ovitraps placed standard ovitrap surveillance format is given in annexure vi 495 the bg sentinel traps bg sentinel traps use a combination of attractive visual and olfactory cues for collection adult ae aegypti and ae albopictus female mosquitoes this trap is comparatively light and the female mosquitoes are trap in it bgsentinel traps are more effective in capturing ae aegypti and also collect adult females in all physiological states thus it is more advantagous as compared to the traditional ovipositional trap the efficiency of bg traps can be increased by baiting them with lures eg co2 bglure 410 planning of vector surveillance activities dengue prevention and control is a decentralized programme in sri lanka the national dengue control unit ndcu provides technical guidance and necessary logistic support while planning is done at the provincial district and medical officer of health moh area levels when planning entomological surveys for the forthcoming month the advance programme of the entomological assistantteam should be prepared by the entomological assistant in consultation with the regional epidemiologist entomologist regional officersmedical officers of the antimalaria campaign anti filariasis campaign and the medical officer of health of the respective moh area,dengue vector surveillance and control techniques larval identification third and fourth instar larvae are identified immediately in the lab while first and second instars develop to later stages for identification pupae are allowed to develop into adults for species identification larval density indices container index ci house index hi and breteau index bi measure vector density for aedes aegypti and aedes albopictus mixed breeding containers are counted for both species separately to reflect individual species vector density an hi or bi above 3 for ae aegypti indicates a potential dengue outbreak in sri lanka triggering targeted control measures pupal and adult surveys the pupal index estimates adult production though it is laborintensive and reserved for specialized studies adult surveys assess biting patterns seasonal trends and control efficacy through methods like human landing collections baited double nets and indoor resting collections oviposition and bg sentinel traps ovitraps monitor egglaying behavior in areas with low larval counts and determine vector density bgsentinel traps use co or bglure to attract and capture adult female aedes mosquitoes
the molecular diversity of glycosaminoglycans shapes animal development introduction animal development involves the differentiation of individual cell types and their assembly into specific tissue and organ types for example the morphological differentiation of neurons and the generation of specific functional domains in the brain require extensive cell migrations and specific axonal and dendritic growth processes the extracellular space plays an important role in these processes as cells have to interact with structures present in the extracellular environment the extracellular environment is composed of a complex array of biopolymers commonly termed extracellular matrices extracellular matrices show several structural specializations for example the basement membrane is a specialized electrondense extracellular matrix that separates distinct cell types in addition to key protein components like laminins and collagens a large portion of extracellular matrices and basement membranes is composed of proteoglycans pgs which are proteins with covalently attached glycosaminoglycan gag polysaccharide side chains these proteinbound gags are classified according to their sugar composition as keratan sulfates ks chondroitin sulfates cs dermatan sulfates ds and heparan sulfates hs figure 1 the gags exhibit complex modification patterns consisting predominantly of sulfations of hydroxyl groups and epimerizations of specific carbon atoms of individual sugar molecules figure 1 hyaluronan a fifth gag shows no modifications and is not attached to a protein backbone spicer et al 2002 toole 2001 2004 it is therefore not discussed here modifications of sugar residues create enormous molecular diversity and gags have been suggested to be the most informationdense biological molecules turnbull et al 2001 for example a mere octasaccharide allows for more than one million theoretical combinations of modification patterns because the gag side chains found in vivo are usually 50150 disaccharide repeat units long the combinatorial possibilities are rendered nearly boundless esko lindahl 2001 esko selleck 2002 a number of articles have recently reviewed the significance of pgs in various experimental systems with a focus on core proteins and gag chains including results from biochemical studies esko selleck 2002 hacker et al 2005 kramer yost 2003 lee et al 2004 lin 2004 van vactor et al 2006 although gags and their core proteins have important physiological and homeostatic roles eg during inflammation and the immune response li et al 2002 park et al 2001 wang et al 2005 we concentrate here on the developmental roles of gags we focus on reviewing a experiments using genetically amenable model organisms and b results obtained from the analysis of human disease we first give a brief overview of the in vivo role of various core proteins to which gags are attached we then discuss the in vivo role of different biosynthetic enzymes involved in gag synthesis finally we review recent results obtained in different organisms in regard to gag modifications and discuss the resulting implications taken together the experiments reviewed here demonstrate the importance of gags in animal development and hint at the exciting possibility that distinct modification patterns in gags may provide information in the form of a specific code that is required for metazoan development core proteins in this section we review the evidence available for the in vivo function of pg core proteins these studies clearly establish that pg core proteins are indispensable for the correct development of almost all metazoan organisms that have been studied the classification into core proteins that carry ks cs ds or hs is not always strict because there are a considerable number of proteins that bear more than one kind of gag side chain keratan sulfate core proteins the large majority of ks core proteins are members of a family of small leucinerichrepeat proteins slrps iozzo 1999 based on sequence exonic structure and the presence of a distinctive cysteinerich cluster in the proteins nterminal portion slrps can be divided into four subclasses iozzo 1999 table 1 only class ii and iii slrps have been shown to be decorated with ks side chains whereas for class iv slrps ks decoration is predicted on the basis of conserved attachment sites present in the protein sequence leucinerich repeats are proteinprotein interaction domains and slrps are believed to have a characteristic horseshoelike structure in which the concave surface is involved in binding other proteins eg collagen triple helices iozzo 1999 the gag chain attachment sites seem to be located on the convex side of the horseshoe binding of collagen triple helices is important for the regulated assembly of collagen into supramolecular structures fibrils whereas the role of the gag chains in this context is less clear most ks core proteins have now been targeted in mice table 1 ks is most abundant in the cornea and in cartilageconnective tissues funderburgh 2000 2002 and consistent with ks localization and the function of slrps in regulating the assembly of collagen fibrils mouse mutants have varying defects in collagenrich tissues such as cornea or connective tissues mice lacking mimecanosteoglycin show mild defects in skin fragility that are associated with ultrastructural changes in collagen fibrils chakravarti 2003 lumicandeficient mice exhibit symptoms of skin fragility and defects in collagen structure whereas fibromodulin knockout mice show primarily defects in cartilage structure eg tendon stiffness the phenotypes of mice mutant for any of these genes are however strikingly specific and are both overlapping and nonoverlapping doublemutant analyses and expression studies indicate that lumican and fibromodulin have redundant functions in certain tissues while serving exclusive functions in others for a review see chakravarti 2003 in contrast to the predominant cartilage defects seen in the abovementioned mutants loss of function of keratocankera which is almost exclusively expressed in the cornea causes eye disease in humans mutations in kera have been associated with patients suffering from a disorder called cornea plana type 2 cna2 mim 217 300 in which the cornea is lacking the appropriate convex shape and is unable to correctly refract the light coming in through the lens pellegata et al 2000 mutations in the predicted ks carrying the class iv slrp gene nyxnyctalopin also specifically affect eye development bechhansen et al 2000 pusch et al 2000 patients harboring mutations in this gene have xlinked complete stationary night blindness csnb1 mim310500 the disease does not seem to be caused by gross morphological eye defects bechhansen et al 2000 pusch et al 2000 but rather seems to be due to functional defects possibly in the neuronal circuitry of the visual system again the significance of ks in the etiology of night blindness is not clear but together these findings are consistent with important functions of ks and keratan sulfate proteoglycans kspgs in eye development chondroitindermatan sulfate core proteins chondroitin and dermatan proteoglycans cspgs and dspgs respectively have recently attracted much attention as inhibitors of axon growth and have been shown to be important components of the glial scar that prevents axon regeneration for a review see rhodes fawcett 2004 these proteins are a heterogeneous class of proteins consisting of lecticans and several other classes of proteins including eg slrps lecticans are predominantly secreted proteins and include aggrecan versican neurocan and brevican and their derivatives reviewed by yamaguchi 2000 lectican expression is spatially and temporally regulated for instance aggrecan and versican seem to be expressed in all connective tissues and neuronal tissues whereas neurocan and brevican expression is more prevalent in neuronal tissues common to all lecticans is a domain structure predicted to share a rodlike central part with two globular ends at the n and c termini respectively whereas the nterminal globular domain is believed to mediate interactions with hyaluronan the cterminal domain containing a clectin domainhence the name is involved in providing interactions with tenascins yamaguchi 2000 the central portion of the protein which exhibits considerable variation through alternative splicing harbors the gag attachment sites which are primarily decorated with cs yamaguchi 2000 the csds chains are attached to a conserved serine residue within defined consensus attachment sites figure 2 esko zhang 1996 however several lecticans including aggrecan and neurocan have also been shown to contain ks depending on the tissue source from which they were isolated yamaguchi 2000 the functional significance of this diversity in aggrecan remains obscure many cs core proteins have now been investigated through lossoffunction analyses in mice with surprising results whereas two lethal mouse mutants cmd cartilage matrix deficiency and hdf heart defect have molecular lesions in the aggrecan and versican genes respectively mjaatvedt et al 1998 watanabe et al 1994 many knockouts of cspgs in mice have only mild if any detectable defects table 1 lecticans are believed to form a threedimensional matrix together with tenascins and hyaluronan yamaguchi 2000 this network of gags and proteins may exhibit an inherent flexibility and redundancy that allows for the loss of one or more com ponents of the network alternatively other compensatory mechanisms may exist for example quadruple knockouts of neurocan brevican tenascinc and tenascinr are still viable and fertile possibly owing to compensatory upregulation of ecm molecules such as fibulins rauch et al 2005 molecular lesions in class i slrps affect primarily collagen and bone structure table 1 again some members of this class may be genetically redundant biglycan and decorin doublemutant animals show much more severe defects than do the single mutants although the extent of the defects is also tissue dependent young et al 2003 it is not clear from these studies whether all defects result from impaired collagen stability or may also be the result of inappropriate signal transduction in eg the transforming growth factor tgf signaling pathway young et al 2003,glycosaminoglycans gags are diverse polysaccharides that along with their associated proteins play a critical role in animal development particularly in tissue formation and cellular differentiation gags attach to proteins to form proteoglycans pgs which are components of the extracellular matrix ecm this matrix provides structural support and regulates cellular activities through its complex composition including keratan sulfate ks chondroitin sulfate cs dermatan sulfate ds and heparan sulfate hs gags exhibit complex molecular modifications enabling a vast array of structural variations essential for precise cellular signaling and tissue organization ks and cs are especially important in cartilage and eye development where mutations in proteins like keratocan and lumican can lead to disorders like cornea plana and night blindness additionally cs and ds contribute to nerve growth regulation and are significant in scar formation after injury proteins like aggrecan and versican illustrate the matrixs flexibility with redundancy ensuring resilience this molecular diversity hints at a gag code that helps guide complex developmental processes
heparan sulfate core proteins heparan sulfate proteoglycans hspgs can be divided in three major classes on the basis of their primary structure syndecans are type i transmembrane proteins with an extracellular domain carrying the hs chains near the n terminus and a cytoplasmic tail that typically contains a pdzbinding domain table 1 bernfield et al 1999 a second class is composed of glypicans so called because they are anchored to the membrane via a glycerophosphatidylinositide gpi glypicans share 14 characteristic cysteine residues and are believed to adopt a globular tertiary structure in which gag chains are attached proximal to the membrane bernfield et al 1999 both of these membraneassociated hspgs can be cleaved in the juxtamembrane region to be released from the membrane bernfield et al 1999 hacker et al 2005 the biological significance of which is only beginning to emerge see below finally a third class includes secreted molecules such as perlecan collagen xviii and agrin table 1 which are large multidomain proteins bernfield et al 1999 vertebrates typically contain four syndecan genes and six glypican genes in contrast only one syndecan and two glypicans have been identified in invertebrates table 1 the hs chains are attached via an invariant tetrasaccharide linker which hs shares with csds to a serine within a conserved attachment site figure 2 analyses of lossoffunction alleles of syndecans in vertebrates exhibit surprisingly subtle defects many of which were discovered only subsequent to initial misoverexpression experiments table 1 for example a physiological role of sdc3 was uncovered only after a transgenic mouse strain misexpressing sdc1 in hypothalamic nuclei exhibited abnormal feeding behavior reizes et al 2001 hinting at a functional role for syndecans in the hypothalamus subsequent careful analyses of feeding behaviors in mice deficient in sdc3 the syndecan that is normally expressed in the hypothalamus confirmed the role of syndecan in regulating feeding behaviors these experiments and the subtle and tissuespecific defects in different syndecan mutants indicate that syndecan family members may act in a partially redundant manner in both drosophila and caenorhabditis elegans mutants in the single syndecan are much more severe and exhibit prominent axonal and cell migration defects johnson et al 2004 minniti et al 2004 rhiner et al 2005 steigemann et al 2004 genetic experiments suggest that these defects are due at least in partdepending on the cellular contextto impaired signaling of the slitrobo axon guidance ligandreceptor cassette as we discuss further below johnson et al 2004 rhiner et al 2005 steigemann et al 2004 glypican function has also been studied in several invertebrate and vertebrate systems in zebrafish knypek mutants have molecular lesions in the gpc4gpc6 homolog and display cell migration and polarity defects presumably as a result of impaired wnt signaling topczewski et al 2001 studies in drosophila have shown that both glypicans dally and dallylike are required to shape morphogen gradients of eg wingless and hedgehog although the contribution of the two glypicans for both pathways presumably differ in a tissuespecific manner hacker et al 2005 adding more complexity to hspg function recent studies show that at least dallylike is shed from the plasma membrane and that this process is required for correct wingless signaling this cleavage is induced by an hydrolase that is encoded by the drosophila gene notum originally identified as a gene that modulates wingless activity kirkpatrick et al 2004 kreuger et al 2004 mutations in the human gpc3 gene are associated with simpsongolabibehmel syndrome an overgrowth syndrome characterized by a range of visceral and skeletal abnormalities pilia et al 1996 the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease are still not completely clear but may at least in part be caused by inappropriate wnt signaling in mice loss of gpc3 leads to inhibition of noncanonical wnt signaling and activation of canonical wnt signaling song et al 2005 in cell culture transfection experiments the hs chains of gpc3 seemed to be dispensible for gpc3mediated activation of noncanonical wnt signaling but could nevertheless potentiate gpc3 activity in vivo song et al 2005 mutations in the secreted hspg perlecan have deleterious consequences and null mutations in all organisms that have been studied are lethal table 1 in nematodes perlecanunc52 is required for muscle attachment and growth factor signaling and complete loss of function leads to midembryonic lethality merz et al 2003 rogalski et al 1993 in humans schwartzjampel syndrome which is characterized by skeletal defects and developmental eye defects is likely caused by lossoffunction mutations in the perlecan gene nicole et al 2000 in mice loss of perlecan function leads to a variety of defects ranging from severe developmental brain defects to skeletal abnormalities arikawahirasawa et al 1999 in addition perlecan is required for proper assembly of functional synaptic basal lamina arikawahirasawa et al 2002 notably mice that express a form of perlecan lacking the major hs attachment site are viable and fertile but have small eyes and lenses that progressively degenerate after birth rossi et al 2003 this indicates that some essential functions are associated with the pg core protein alone the nonfibrillar collagen xviii is a multidomain hspg that is expressed in the basement membrane of nearly all epithelia and endothelia and appears to be part of a higherorder network of integral basement membrane proteins reviewed in marneros et al 2005 mice homozygous for a null mutation in collagen xviii have very specific defects in eye development fukai et al 2002 that are similar to the defects observed in human knobloch syndrome patients who harbor a mutation in the human collagen xviii gene sertie et al 2000 reminiscent of the situation with cspgs there seems to be redundancy between hsbearing basement membrane proteins as double mutants between collagen xviii and hsdeficient perlecan mutants display much more severe eye phenotypes than do the single mutants rossi et al 2003 in c elegans loss of function in the collagen xviiilike gene cle1 leads to multiple defects in axonal development and neuronal migration ackley et al 2001 agrin a multidomain protein is another major secreted hspg for a review see bezakova ruegg 2003 in mice agrin is required for correct synaptic development it regulates the postsynaptic specialization at the neuromuscular junction and in the central nervous system bezakova ruegg 2003 gautam et al 1996 in addition agrin has also been implicated in the activation of t cells as part of the immunological synapse khan et al 2001 the role of the hs that decorates agrin in these processes is less clear but may involve the formation of multiprotein complexes between agrin and various growth factors bezakova ruegg 2003 enzymes involved in synthesizing gag chains in this section we discuss mutant phenotypes of enzymes that are involved in synthesizing the various gag chains table 2 the relevant studies clearly establish that many functions of pgs are mediated by their respective gag chains rather than by their protein core in many but not all cases the latter may be a neutral carrier protein bernfield et al 1999 we include in our discussion enzymes that catalyze reactions involving the sugar units figures 2 and 3 but omit enzymes and transporters that are involved in providing building components such as the activated monosaccharides or sulfate mutations in genes coding for proteins of the latter category are likely to have more pleiotropic consequences as they may also affect pathways that are unrelated to gag synthesis for instance the enzymes synthesizing paps phosphoadenosylphosphosulfate as the universal sulfate donor in all sulfation reactions would affect all sulfation reactions including tyrosine sulfation which is unrelated to gag chain synthesis keratan sulfate biosynthesis ks differs from cs ds and hs in that it is attached to core proteins via short oligosaccharides rather than the characteristic tetrasaccharide that is common to the latter gags the linkage oligosaccharides may be branched and can be attached to either asparagine nlinked or serinethreonine olinked in the respective core protein figure 3a on the basis of the structure of these linkage oligosaccharides ks can be classified into at least three classes figure 3a funderburgh 2002 little is known of the specific enzymes synthesizing the oligosaccharides that attach ks to a protein core but they may be the same enzymes responsible for noglycosylation of proteins with small branched oligosaccharides funderburgh 2002 the ks chain is polymerized onto the oligosaccharides by the alternating actions of a 14galactosyltransferase and a 13nacetylglycosaminyltransferase figure 3b several genes in vertebrate genomes are predicted to code for proteins that carry these enzymatic activities it remains unclear which of these genes catalyze the formation of ks in vivo and whether different classes of ks are synthesized by different enzymes,heparan sulfate proteoglycans hspgs are essential molecules divided into three classes based on structure and function syndecans are transmembrane proteins with heparan sulfate hs chains close to the nterminus and a pdzbinding domain at the cytoplasmic tail they play critical roles in cell signaling and behavior such as syndecan3 sdc3 which influences feeding behaviors in mice by interacting with hypothalamic signaling pathways vertebrates have four syndecan genes whereas invertebrates typically have only one glypicans are membraneanchored via a glycerophosphatidylinositol gpi link commonly involved in cell signaling morphogenesis and forming morphogen gradients for example glypican mutants in zebrafish and drosophila show impaired wnt signaling and disrupted development of structures like wings and cells secreted hspgs include perlecan collagen xviii and agrin which are large extracellular proteins critical for maintaining structural integrity and proper signaling perlecan is associated with skeletal health and mutations in collagen xviii cause developmental eye defects seen in knobloch syndrome these hspg classes contribute to cell adhesion signaling and tissuespecific functions impacting development and cellular responses across species
chondroitin dermatan and heparan sulfate biosynthesis conceptually cs ds and hs synthesis can be divided into at least two biosynthetic steps polymerization and modification figure 2 first following attachment to a protein by designated glycosyltransferases the polysaccharide side chains are copolymerized by enzymes specific for the individual types of gags second the chains are modified by specific sulfotransferases and epimerases figure 2 it should be noted that in vivo polymerization and modifications may occur concomittantly rather than sequentially esko selleck 2002 synthesis of the tetrasaccharide linker region in agreement with their structural similarities csds and hs share the enzymes that synthesize the linker region tethering the sugar chain to a serine residue within the protein backbone figure 2 in a genetic screen for mutants in c elegans that display an abnormally shaped vulva mutants in all four genes coding for the enzymes responsible for synthesizing the tetrasaccharide linker region were identified figure 2a herman horvitz 1999 herman et al 1999 hwang et al 2003a mutants in all four genes are maternaleffect lethal ie homozygous animals derived from a heterozygous mother develop to adulthood and display vulval organogenesis defects but then give rise to developmentally arrested embryos this lethality is likely caused by cytokinesis defects hwang horvitz 2002 embryonic phenotypes of certain mutations eg in sqv3 and sqv8 are slightly different which may be due to allelic variability or redundancy herman horvitz 1999 a strong maternal contribution of gagsynthesizing enzymes has also been observed in flies see below and perrimon et al 1996 in humans enzymatic defects in galactosyltransferase i which catalyzes the formation of a 14 glycosidic bond between the first galactose moeity and the xylosyl residue that is attached directly to the serine in the protein have been associated with progeroid ehlersdanlos syndrome quentin et al 1990 a severe condition characterized by mental retardation and connective tissuerelated defects consistent with this finding missense mutations have been identified in this gene in patients suffering from the disease these mutations change highly conserved amino acid residues in the protein leading to impaired enzymatic activity in vitro okajima et al 1999 seidler et al 2006 because the linker regions of csds and hs are identical mutations in the linkersynthesizing enzymes do not distinguish between a requirement for csds or hs synthesis or both however they clearly establish that complete lack of csds and hs gags is incompatible with metazoan life enzymes that polymerize the gag chain csds polymerization csds gag synthesis requires the concerted action of three enzymatic activities that may be encoded by one or more genes following synthesis of the tetrasaccharide linker region a chondroitin nacetylgalactosaminyltransferase galnacti also known as chgn catalyzes attachment of the first galactosamine residue onto the distal glucuronic acid of the linker region figure 2a sugahara et al 2003 a chondroitin synthase chsy with galnactii and glcatii activity then copolymerizes the chondroitin chain by alternatingly adding glucuronic acid and nacetylgalactosamine residues figure 2a no lossoffunction mutation in either of these enzymes has been reported in vertebrates the first clues as to the in vivo function of chondroitin came again from the squashed vulva screen in c elegans and a concomitant reverse genetic approach hwang et al 2003b mizuguchi et al 2003 sqv5 codes for the only chsy ortholog in c elegans and harbors both chgn and chsy activity figure 2a sqv5mutant animals display all the phenotypes of the other sqv mutants thus establishing that chondroitin in c elegans is required for cytokinesis and morphogenesis hwang et al 2003b mizuguchi et al 2003 hs polymerization hs is initiated by the addition of glcnac to the distal glucuronic acid residue of the linker region figure 2a it is this step that commits a growing saccharide chain to either hs or csds following initiation the hs side chain is then synthesized by the alternating addition of glucuronic acid and nacetylglucosamine requiring glcnactii and glcatii transferase activities figure 2a sugahara kitagawa 2002 these activities are provided by enzymes belonging to the exostosis family of proteins exts ext genes have been shown to be tumor suppressor genes that upon partial loss of function cause exostoses a particular type of bone tumors in humans ahn et al 1995 stickens et al 1996 in flies mice and worms complete loss of function of the ext genes causes embryonic lethality probably owing to inappropriate signaling of morphogens this demonstrates that hs is essential for morphogen signaling and viability bellaiche et al 1998 lin et al 2000 morio et al 2003 stickens et al 2005 more recently mutations in ext genes have also been analyzed in nervous system development by removing ext1 exclusively in the brain inatani and colleagues circumvented the early lethality in the unconditional knockout in mice and showed that brain morphogenesis is severely disrupted in the absence of hs inatani et al 2003 similarly mutations in the zebrafish ext genes dackel and boxer result in specific defects in axon tract formation in the nervous system lee et al 2004 enzymes involved in modifying gag chains following polymerization the growing gag chains are subject to a number of modifications that are introduced by resident golgi enzymes in a nonlinear fashion along the chains lindahl et al 1998 this creates domains that share common basic patterns such as for example domains in hs that contain nsulfated glucosamine a mix of nacetylated or sulfated glucosamine or merely acetylated domains figure 2b sulfotransferases epimerases and sulfatases further modify the gag chain figure 2b in this section we discuss the analysis of lossoffunction mutations in these gagmodifying enzymes obtained in a variety of model systems recently emerging results provide the best in vivo evidence to date that gag chain modifications play specific roles during development keratan sulfate modifications in development ks may be modified with a sulfate moiety at position 6o of both the nacetylglucosamine and the galactose residues figure 3b there are several lines of evidence that the glucosamine6osulfotransferase introduces a modification that is a prerequisite for chain elongation first this enzyme can introduce sulfate only on the terminal glucosamine residue that ks is essentially completely sulfated on its glucosamine residues suggests that sulfation must occur during elongation see funderburgh 2002 second mutations in this gene have been identified in patients suffering from macular corneal dystrophy mcd mim 217800 an autosomal recessive disorder that leads to opacities in the cornea and eventually blindness akama et al 2000 ks is largely absent in the cornea of patients with the disease also arguing for the essential role of 6osulfation of glucosamine during elongation genetic removal of nacetylglucosamine 6osulfotransferase1 also known as chst2 in mice results in a loss of ks immunostaining in the central nervous system but not in cartilage zhang et al 2006 these animals show reduced glial scar formation in a nerve injury model and increased axonal regeneration zhang et al 2006 demonstrating that not only cspgs but also kspgs may contain antiregenerative properties in summary several nacetylglucosamine6osulfotransferases that are involved in ks synthesismodification exist in vivo and create tissuespecific modification patterns through nonoverlapping expression patterns in contrast ksgal6st figure 3b introduces modifications on the galactose residue in a nonuniform way thereby creating domains of sulfated and unsulfated galactose however no mutational analyses have been conducted for this gene in any organism in conclusion ks is an important component of the cornea and lack of the appropriate amount of ks has deleterious consequences but more work is required to understand fully the role of keratan sulfation in development chondroitindermatan sulfate modifications in development csds exhibit complex modification patterns and in vitro experiments have suggested functional significance for some of these patterns for a review see sugahara et al 2003 the modifications are introduced by specific enzymes that transfer sulfate moieties onto defined positions of the sugar residue or convert glucuronic acid to its epimeric iduronic acid figures 1 2b table 3 uchimura et al 2002 established unambiguously the significance of specific cs modifications in vivo by creating mice deficient in c6st1 chst3 a chondroitin6osulfotransferase figure 2b although mice lacking this enzyme were viable and fertile they displayed a decreased number of naive t lymphocytes in the spleen neuronal anatomy has not been examined in detail in these mouse mutants but is worth testing because enzymatic removal of cs causes axontargeting defects in the optic system chung et al 2000 because the mouse genome contains at least two closely related enzymes coding for putative chondroitin6osulfotransferases these strikingly specific defects may be due to redundancy but nevertheless point to very specific functions of 6osulfated cs as cs is an inhibitor of axon regeneration rhodes fawcett 2004 it would also be interesting to see whether c6stdeficient mice display differences in axon regeneration assays which would make these enzymes interesting as drug targets to promote axonal regeneration in contrast to the relatively mild defects in mice mutations in the human ortholog chst3 c6st1 are associated with skeletal abnormalities due to severe chondrodysplasia thiele et al 2004 it currently is unclear why the mutation in humans leads to such severe skeletal defects while having only a mild effect on spleen function in mice one possible explanation may be that requirements for certain modification patterns have diverged between species or alternatively that expression patterns between isoenzymes have diverged in contrast to the relatively mild defects in a knockout of c6st1 in mice a lossoffunction allele of c4st1 a chondroitin 4osulfotransferase has deleterious effects kluppel et al 2005 mutant animals show severe skeletal abnormalities and die within hours after birth with severe respiratory problems kluppel et al 2005 the skeletal abnormalities are likely to result from disorganization of the cartilage growth plate possibly owing to inappropriate tgf signaling like c6st1 mutants c4st1mutant mice have not been investigated in relation to any neuronal or possible axon regeneration phenotypes the substantial range in phenotypes between the c6st1 and c4st1 lossoffunction alleles in mice demonstrates the significance of specific modifications in csds these studies illustrate in vivo that the sulfate residues in csds are not solely negative charges arrayed along the sugar side chains but rather residues that are introduced at defined positions to subserve specific functions although cs has been biochemically identified in drosophila toyoda et al 2000 and orthologs of the cssynthesizing and modifying enzymes can be identified in its genome no mutational analyses have been conducted in contrast chondroitin in c elegans does not seem to be sulfated toyoda et al 2000 and consistent with this no homologous cs sulfotransferase genes can be identified in the c elegans genome he bulow unpublished data,the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate cs dermatan sulfate ds and heparan sulfate hs involves two main stages polymerization and modification initially glycosyltransferases attach a polysaccharide chain to a protein forming cs ds or hs via distinct polymerizing enzymes modifications follow where sulfotransferases and epimerases add specific structural elements to the chains importantly polymerization and modification can occur simultaneously in living systems the linker regiona tetrasaccharide attaching the gags to serine in proteinsplays a pivotal role shared across csds and hs mutations in linkersynthesizing enzymes identified in organisms like c elegans disrupt cellular processes and can be lethal in humans defects in galactosyltransferase enzymes linked to the linker region can lead to ehlersdanlos syndrome marked by connective tissue issues for polymerization csds requires enzymes such as chondroitin synthase and glycosyltransferases for chain elongation hs synthesis involves glucosamine transferases and hs modifications are essential for morphogen signaling and development specific modifications are crucial for development for example chondroitin6osulfotransferase deficiencies in humans cause skeletal abnormalities while keratan sulfate modifications are vital for corneal clarity
heparan sulfate modifications in development hs contains the largest number of different modifications as compared with ks cs and ds figure 1 consequently hs has the potential to provide a large amount of information content the significance of which we are only beginning to appreciate figure 2b the first modification step of the hs chain involves deacetylation and sulfation of the nitrogen atom in nacetylglucosamine figures 1 2b which is catalyzed by the ndeacetylasensulfotransferase ndst class of enzymes this modification seems to be either a prerequisite or a strong facilitator of subsequent modifications for a review see esko selleck 2002 nsulfation occurs nonuniformly along the chain thereby creating domains from proximal to distal containing nonmodified nacetylglucosamines stretches in which nacetylglucosamine exists together with nsulfated glucosamine and finally domains with nearly exclusively nsulfated glucosamine figure 2b esko selleck 2002 it is not known by what mechanism these domains are formed and what factors may regulate and direct the activity of ndsts the same screen for lethal drosophila mutations that led to the isolation of toutvelu the fly homolog of an hs polymerase see above also resulted in the isolation of a gene called sulfateless which codes for the fly homolog of the ndst lin perrimon 1999 this represents the first in vivo analysis of an hsmodifying enzyme and the genetic interactions between sulfateless and wingless establish that sulfation of hs is specifically required for correct growth factor signaling lin perrimon 1999 vertebrates contain four ndst genes and loss of two of them causes strikingly specific phenotypes fan et al 2000 forsberg et al 1999 grobe et al 2005 humphries et al 1999 ringvall et al 2000 lesions in the ndst2 gene cause severe abnormalities in mast cells forsberg et al 1999 humphries et al 1999 that are due to the absence of correctly modified heparin an intracellular persulfated version of the extracellular heparan sulfate in contrast ndst1 mutants die perinatally of respiratory failure presumably owing to immature lungs fan et al 2000 ringvall et al 2000 these mutants also show lowpercentage embryonic lethality and developmental defects of skull and brain ringvall et al 2000 a closer look at these defects in ndst1deficient mice established completely penetrant forebrain defects facial abnormalities and axon guidance defects probably due to aberrant growth factor signaling grobe et al 2005 these analyses demonstrate that vertebrate development like fly development specifically requires sulfation of the gag chains double mutants of ndst1 and ndst2 knockout mice have more severe phenotypes than do single mutants suggesting partially redundant roles of the individual ndsts ringvall et al 2000 because ndsts do not display different enzymatic activities the differences between the singleknockout phenotypes in vertebrates may be a reflection of their nonoverlapping expression patterns the hs 2osulfotransferase hs2st transfers a sulfate moiety onto the hydroxyl group in position 2 of the hexuronic acid within the hs disaccharides figures 1 and 2b vertebrates and invertebrates have only one obvious hs2st gene for a review see kuschegullberg kjellen 2003 lossoffunction mutations in hs2st have been studied in mice and worms bullock et al 1998 bulow hobert 2004 kinnunen et al 2005 mice with an enhancer trap mutation in hs2st display severe developmental kidney defects bullock et al 1998 additionally animals show skeletal abnormalities as well as defects in cortical development bullock et al 1998 mclaughlin et al 2003 loss of the c elegans hs2st gene hst2 causes axonal guidance defects as well as cell migration defects bulow hobert 2004 kinnunen et al 2005 pipe a drosophila gene involved in dorsalventral patterning shows similarities to hs2sts sen et al 1998 yet may not modify hs zhu et al 2005 indeed the fly genome contains one gene other than pipe that shows higher similarities to vertebrate and invertebrate hs2sts zhu et al 2005 but this gene has not been studied functionally the epimerase that isomerizes the c5 carbon atom in the hexuronic residue from glucuronic acid to iduronic acid hs c5 epimerase hs c5epi figures 1 and 2b is typically only represented by a single copy in both vertebrate and invertebrate genomes mice deficient for hs c5epi die perinatally from respiratory failure owing to poorly inflated lungs li et al 2003 additionally mutants lack kidneys and have skeletal abnormalities including polydactyly twisted tail and a malformed rib cage these defects are strongly reminiscent of hs2st and ndst1 mutants bullock et al 1998 fan et al 2000 ringvall et al 2000 see above however there is at least one important difference hs2st mutants seem to have normal lungs whereas ndst1 mutants have apparently normal kidneys these data are consistent with the notion that different tissues require specific combinations of hsmodification patterns for their correct development see below zebrafish has two epimerase genes and knockdown experiments with morpholino analogs lead to defects in dorsalventral patterning of the early embryo that are possibly due to impaired bone morphogenetic protein bmp signaling ghiselli farber 2005 in addition there are two more known activities that catalyze sulfotransfer reactions onto respective hydroxyl groups in the glucosamine residue hs 3osulfotransferases hs3sts and hs 6osulfotransferases hs6sts unlike in invertebrates in vertebrates both gene families have expanded there are at least six hs3sts and three hs6sts in mice only one hs3st has been inactivated in mice resulting in mild defects with intrauterine growth retardation hajmohammadi et al 2003 shworak et al 2003 biochemical experiments have shown that hs 3osulfation is a crucial component in the antithrombinbinding site of heparin which mediates antithrombins anticoagulant activity for a review see esko selleck 2002 although the particular hs3st enzyme shown biochemically to introduce the modification in the antithrombinbinding site was inactivated in mice blood coagulation was not affected in these animals hajmohammadi et al 2003 shworak et al 2003 redundancy again may be one possible explanation further studies are required to determine which genes codes for the enzymes that introduces 3osulfate within the antithrombinbinding site of hs in vivo in flies hs3sts have been studied using rna interference rnaimediated knockdown techniques which indicate a role for hs 3osulfation in notchdependent signaling kamimura et al 2004 whereas vertebrates harbor at least three genes coding for hs6sts only a single gene is found in flies and worms morpholinomediated knockdown experiments in zebrafish have shown that 6osulfation is involved in muscle and vascular development bink et al 2003 chen et al 2005 and in flies rnaimediated knockdown leads to defects in tracheal development that are very similar to defects observed in the fly mutant breathless fibroblast growth factor receptor fgfr this result is consistent with the crucial role of 6osulfation in fibroblast growth factor fgf signaling kamimura et al 2001 as suggested by the crystal structure of fgffgfr with heparin figure 4a for a review see pellegrini 2001 in c elegans loss of the hst6st gene hst6 leads to cellspecific defects in axon guidance that are similar yet not identical to defects caused by loss of function in hse5 the epimerase or hst2 the hs 2osulfotransferase bulow hobert 2004 these experiments show that different neurons require different combinations of hs modifications in different cellular contexts in fact one class of motor neurons requires distinct hs modifications for different aspects of their development longitudinal guidance and fasciculation of these neurons are independent of hs6osulfation yet require hse5 and hst2mediated hs modifications whereas dorsal guidance is dependent on all three hs modifications bulow hobert 2004 these genetic experiments are consistent with combinations of hs modifications serving specific functions during development in a cellspecific manner all the aforementioned hs modifications are believed to be introduced during hs synthesis in the golgi apparatus however recent work suggests that hs once it is part of the extracellular matrix is not static but may be dynamically modified this notion is based on the identification of a phylogenetically conserved endosulfatase qsulf1 which specifically hydrolyzes the 6osulfate group of hs dhoot et al 2001 moreover antisense experiments show that qsulf1 can facilitate wnt signaling in vitro and may be an antagonist of fgf signaling for a review see lin 2004 analysis of lossoffunction alleles of qsulf homologs in model organisms will be important in understanding the in vivo significance of this gene,heparan sulfate hs undergoes extensive modifications that contribute to complex biological signaling during development the initial modification involves ndeacetylation and nsulfation of glucosamine facilitated by ndst enzymes creating domains along the hs chain with varying sulfation patterns in drosophila mutations in the sulfateless gene encoding ndst highlight the necessity of sulfation in proper growth factor signaling in vertebrates multiple ndst genes exist with specific loss causing distinct developmental abnormalities such as in mast cells and lung formation suggesting hs modifications are crucial for diverse tissuespecific functions subsequent modifications include 2o 3o and 6osulfation the hs2st enzyme adds sulfate to the hexuronic acid and lossoffunction mutations cause kidney skeletal and neural development defects in mice and c elegans the 3osulfotransferases hs3sts are significant in anticoagulation but show redundancy in vivo while hs 6osulfotransferases hs6sts are vital for muscle vascular and neuronal development through fgfr signaling the hs c5 epimerase hs c5epi is essential for lung and kidney development with defects linked to respiratory failure and skeletal abnormalities a unique postsynthetic modification by qsulf1 an endosulfatase allows dynamic changes in the extracellular matrix influencing pathways like wnt and fgf these findings underscore the specificity of hs modifications for cellspecific developmental cues
emerging concepts loss of heparan sulfate function mimics loss of function in signaling pathways a common theme throughout all studies is that compromised gag function and hs function in particular leads to remarkably specific defects not only are the phenotypes very specific they are often also strikingly similar to lossoffunction phenotypes of known developmental signaling pathways hacker et al 2005 lin 2004 for example a screen for genes involved in pattern formation in drosophila not only resulted in the isolation of known mutants in signaling components like wingless or breathless fgfr but also of genes involved in hs biosynthesis or modification these include toutvelu hs polymerase see above sugarless an enzyme required for glucuronic acid biosynthesis and not discussed here sulfateless hs ndst see above slalom a sulfate transporter and dally a drosophila glypican see above perrimon et al 1996 the segment polarity phenotype of these genes is very similar to the phenotype caused by mutations in morphogens like hedgehog and wingless genetic experiments involving the hs mutants show that signaling of the morphogens wingless and hedgehog are dependent on hs although intriguingly the contribution of hs may be different in different tissues hacker et al 2005 han et al 2004 in addition hs and hspgs have a role in shaping the activity gradients of these morphogens which are believed to regulate target gene expression in a concentrationdependent manner for example mutations in the exostoses family of hs polymerases in drosophila show defects in decapentaplegic and wingless signaling due to changed morphogen gradients han et al 2004 takei et al 2004 the et al 1999 how gradients form is a matter of debate but they may be the combined result of both passive and active processes including eg diffusion degradation and internalization kruse et al 2004 lander et al 2002 all of which may be influenced by hs andor hspgs thus hs may impinge on growth factor signaling at several levels by modulating signaling as well as by defining the shape of morphogen gradients it will be interesting to investigate the individual contribution of hsmodification patterns to these processes lastly a mutation in the hsmodifying enzyme sulfateless ndst shows defects that are comparable with those of the fgfr mutants heartless and breathless lin et al 1999 indeed fgfr function in drosophila is dependent on sulfateless that is it is specifically dependent on sugar modifications of hs lin et al 1999 fgf signaling in drosophila may also be specifically dependent on 6osulfation kamimura et al 2001 during nervous system development axon guidance by the slitrobo signaling cassette is critically dependent on hs as shown by the fact that mutations in hssynthesizing enzymes show genetic interactions with robo mutants in mice and zebrafish inatani et al 2003 lee et al 2004 moreover slitrobomediated axon guidance is not only dependent on hs synthesis but on specific hs modifications in c elegans lossoffunction mutations in hsmodifying enzymes show characteristic defects in axonal development that are very similar to lossoffunction mutations in the slitrobo cassette of guidance cues bulow hobert 2004 further more genetic doublemutant analyses suggest that specific combinations of hs are required for correct slitrobo signaling figure 4b see below bulow hobert 2004 this is also consistent with in vitro axon outgrowth assays that show that slit is dependent on hs for its repulsive activity on axons hu 2001 these studies demonstrate an astonishing degree of complexity of hs function and underscore that hs and in particular hs modifications are important components of many signaling pathways although hspgs eg syndecan may act as bona fide ligands that can induce signaling themselves in both cellautonomous and nonautonomous fashions for reviews see bernfield et al 1999 and kramer yost 2003 hspgs and hs have more often been described as modulators of signaling rather than as essential factors this interpretation is based on the observation that both in vitro and in vivo overexpression of a ligand can at least partially compensate for loss of hshspg or of a specific hs modification for that matter for instance overexpression of ligands like wingless and branchless fgf in drosophila can partially rescue the defects in hs mutants see for example hacker et al 1997 lin et al 1999 although this suggests that in principle a ligand may be able to interact molecularly and signal through a receptor independently of hs genetic studies clearly establish that hs is essential under physiological conditions in other words at concentrations normally found in vivo a ligand may only interact in a biologically meaningful way with its cognate receptor if this interaction is mediated by hs endowed with defined modifications this interpretation is also consistent with the crystal structure of the fgffgfrheparin complex which shows that a number of hs modifications form crucial electrostatic bonds with both the ligand and receptor figure 4a reviewed in pellegrini 2001,studies reveal that disruptions in heparan sulfate hs often result in specific developmental defects that closely mimic the loss of key signaling pathways for instance in drosophila mutations in hs biosynthetic genes like toutvelu sulfateless and slalom lead to phenotypes resembling those in signaling mutants for pathways such as wingless and hedgehog hs is pivotal in regulating morphogen gradientscrucial for target gene expressionby influencing factors like diffusion and degradation moreover mutations in the enzyme sulfateless ndst mimic defects seen in fgfr mutants demonstrating fgfrs dependence on hs sulfation especially 6osulfation similarly in neural development hs is critical in axon guidance through the slitrobo signaling system with studies in c elegans and mice showing that specific hs modifications are essential for correct signaling although hs proteoglycans hspgs like syndecans can act as signaling modulators they primarily enhance ligandreceptor interactions at physiological levels for example overexpression of ligands can partially rescue signaling defects in hs mutants but under natural conditions ligandreceptor interactions rely on specific hs modifications for functional signaling
a heparan sulfate code may provide specific and instructive information given the enormous structural diversity in gags and in hs in particular it is tempting to speculate that this diversity may encode information and perhaps may even constitute an hs code figure 5 specifically one could envision that specific combinations of hsmodification patterns figure 5 may provide a celltype andor regionspecific address that dictates which specific signaling pathways or combinations thereof are activated for example in one specific region a defined hsmodification pattern may promote the combinatorial engagement of the slit and netrin ligands with their cognate receptors to steer axons in a specific manner whereas in another region a different modification pattern prevents efficient binding of these ligands to their receptors and rather promotes binding of for example fgf to its receptor this model provides an intriguing mechanistic basis for the concept that many receptorligand systems may act in a combinatorial manner for example to guide cellular and axonal migration yu bargmann 2001 hs molecules are excellent candidates to dictate the combinatorial composition of these ligandreceptor signaling complexes in a celland regiontypespecific manner to be valid the hs code hypothesis needs to satisfy at least three main criteria the first criterion is that the information provided by hs modifications or combinations thereof is specific analyses of mutants in single hsmodifying enzymes in vertebrates demonstrate that specific modifications are important for very distinct aspects of development bullock et al 1998 fan et al 2000 forsberg et al 1999 ghiselli farber 2005 humphries et al 1999 li et al 2003 ringvall et al 2000 shworak et al 2003 one good example are the phenotypes in hs2stmutant mice bullock et al 1998 which are complex and do not seem to overlap completely with any one lossoffunction phenotype in signaling genes for instance hs2st mutants display cortical defects that are similar to those of fgf2 mutants mclaughlin et al 2003 ortega et al 1998 yet fgf2 mutants do not have the kidney defects seen in the hs2st mutant phenotype and hs2st mutants do not seem to have the heart defects of fgf2 mutants bullock et al 1998 zhou et al 1998 these experiments suggest that fgf signaling requires hs 2osulfation in some but not all cellular contexts and that hs 2osulfation regulates different signaling pathways in a cellspecific manner taking this in vivo approach one step further genetic analyses in c elegans showed with singlecell resolution that combinations of hs modifications have cellspecific effects on known cell signaling pathways bulow hobert 2004 axon guidance along the ventral nerve cord of c elegans is a wellstudied paradigm and many cues that guide axons at the ventral midline of c elegans have been identified hobert bulow 2003 for in stance both sax3 and slt1 the c elegans genes coding for the roboslit receptor ligand cassette are required to guide the axons of one class of interneurons the pvqs along the ventral nerve cord hao et al 2001 zallen et al 1998 in wildtype animals pvq axons never cross the ventral midline but do so in sax3 and slt1mutant animals mutations in hse5 hst2 and hst6 which encode kal1 kallmann syndrome protein 1 the hsmodifying enzymes exhibit strikingly similar phenotypes in pvq bulow hobert 2004 genetic doublemutant analyses between hsmodifying enzymes and slitrobo mutants establish that the roboslit signaling cassette requires distinct combinations of hs modifications for correct pvq development figure 4b bulow hobert 2004 in ad dition these studies also show that there are signaling pathways in parallel to the roboslit cassette that may include ephrin receptor and integrin signaling these parallel pathways require distinct combinations of hs modifications for correct pathfinding of pvqs intriguingly a different neuron avm that requires function of the roboslit cassette for correct ventral guidance hao et al 2001 zallen et al 1998 seems completely independent of hs modifications introduced by hse5 hst2 or hst6 bulow hobert 2004 thus a given signaling pathway requires distinct combinations of hs modifications in different cellular contexts similar results were obtained by analyzing the kal1 signaling pathway figure 4b kal1 is a cell adhesion molecule defective in kallmann syndrome a human disease characterized by neuronal targeting and migration phenotypes rugarli ballabio 1993 misexpression of kal1 leads to a variety of defects in c elegans including axon branching and hypodermal patterning defects bulow et al 2002 rugarli et al 2002 these gainoffunction phenotypes are dependent on specific combinations of hsmodifying enzymes again depending on the cellular context figure 4b for example axon branching induced by kal1 requires 6osulfation of glucosamine and epimerization of glucuronic acid in hs whereas the kal1dependent effects on hypodermal patterning require only epimerization bulow hobert 2004 the studies involving sax3slt1 and kal1 provide examples of how two signaling pathways require distinct combinations of hs modifications for correct signaling in vivo vertebrate tissue culture experiments provide further evidence for this notion because alternative hs structures can elicit distinct fgfdependent activities reviewed in turnbull et al 2001 taken together these results are consistent with the first postulate of an hs code namely that hs modifications provide celltype and signalspecific information the second postulate for the existence of an hs code would be that the code is spatially and presumably temporally regulated one could imagine that combinations of hs modifications form molecular addresses or codes figure 5 that are laid out within an organism to create a threedimensional molecular map that is read by the cells and the signaling pathways that encounter it some available evidence indeed points to this direction first biochemical studies demonstrate that hs isolated from the same tissue over the life of an organism displays changes in the modification patterns of disaccharide repeat units feyzi et al 1998 which is consistent with temporal regulation second antibody stainings of different tissues with antibodies that recognize defined hs epitopes also show temporal and spatial regulation of the epitope dennissen et al 2002 third the dynamic expression patterns of hsmodifying enzymes in vertebrates and invertebrates see for example bulow hobert 2004 kinnunen et al 2005 sedita et al 2004 are also consistent with a dynamic extracellular enviroment in which defined codes may be laid out in a celltypeand tissuespecific manner finally carbohydrate engagement assays have shown that fgf1 and fgf8 bind to different structures in tissue sections and that this binding is both hs modification dependent and dynamically regulated allen rapraeger 2003 taken together these studies are consistent with spatial and temporal control of hsmodification patterns the third postulate of the hs code hypothesis would demand that hs modifications act instructively rather than permissively instructiveness of the hs code would predict that changing the code ie introducing novel modification patterns would lead to specific defects possibly through the aberrant engagement of signaling cues indeed misexpression experiments in c elegans whereby hs enzymes are expressed in tissues in which they may normally not be present have nonautonomous effects on axon guidance he bulow o hobert manuscript in preparation individual motor neurons that in a wildtype situation are independent of hs 6osulfation become responsive if spatial modification patterns are altered ie if 6osulfation is provided in tissues that usually do not provide this modfication importantly these motor neurons do not respond to misexpression of hs2st indicating that the observed phenotype is dependent on the regiospecific addition of sulfate in position 6o rather than 2o of nacetylglucosamine he bulow o hobert manuscript in preparation these studies indicate that hs modifications can act instructively moreover the axon guidance molecule semaphorin 5a can act as a bifunctional cue eliciting either repulsive or attractive responses kantor et al 2004 consistent with an instructive role of gags this bifunctionality is determined by the type of gag either cs or hs with which semaphorin 5a interacts kantor et al 2004 these results show that gags and in particular defined modifications can determine axon guidance and are consistent with the existence of an instructive hs code although the discussed experimental evidence is consistent with the hs code hypothesis many issues remain to be addressed modification patterns of hs molecules need to be determined with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution how is specificity in the modification patterns of gag chains controlled how is the hs code read and interpreted mechanistically the combination of biochemical methods such as glycosequencing turnbull 2001 venkataraman et al 1999 and genetic approaches in model organisms will likely help to address these questions in the future,the hs code hypothesis suggests that hss structural diversity can convey specific information potentially providing cellular addresses through distinct patterns of hs modification this mechanism may dictate how signaling pathways are engaged in cell and regionspecific contexts for instance unique hs modifications in certain regions might promote axon guidance by enabling the slitnetrin signaling pathway while alternative modifications in other regions could instead enhance fgf binding three key criteria support the hs code hypothesis specificity unique combinations of hs modifications yield distinct developmental outcomes as shown by hsmutant phenotypes that do not directly mimic traditional signaling mutations spatiotemporal regulation hs modifications appear to be spatially and temporally regulated forming a molecular map guiding cell signaling and migration evidence shows that modification patterns in tissues evolve over time and that hsmodifying enzymes exhibit dynamic expression instructive role modifying hs patterns alters cellular behavior for instance introducing hs modifications in atypical tissues induces specific axonal responses highlighting hss instructive rather than merely permissive role this framework suggests hs modifications act as signaling modulators potentially guiding processes like axon navigation and cell migration with a high degree of precision
the interaction between cellulose and noncellulosic wall polymers the plant cell wall is composed of cellulose noncellulosic wall polysaccharide polymers such as hemicellulose and pectin and a small amount of protein the architecture of the cell wall is required not only to be strong and rigid to provide the structural support for the plant but also to be forgiving in a controlled way to allow for anisotropic cell expansion therefore knowledge of cell wall architecture is fundamental for understanding how cells control growth through cell wall synthesis and cell wall remodeling unlike cellulose which is synthesized at the plasma membrane pm by pmresident cellulose synthase cesa complexes cscs noncellulosic polysaccharides are assembled within the golgi secreted into the apoplast by fusion of golgiderived vesicles with the pm and associated with newly synthesized cellulose microfibrils in the cell wall driouich et al 1993 because cellulose and noncellulosic polymers are synthesized at different locations noncellulosic polymers might not directly influence the biosynthesis of cellulose but rather the mechanical properties of cellulose microfibrils and the assembly of the cell wall matrix xyloglucan xyg is the most abundant hemicellulose in dicot primary walls xyg is thought to form hydrogen bonds along the lengths of cellulose microfibrils and to play a large role in forming the crosslinks between cellulose microfibrils historically there have been two proposed mechanisms by which xyg acts in crosslinking cellulose microfibrils either by xyg chains directly connecting two microfibrils or by xyg chains indirectly connecting two microfibrils through an intermediate network of pectin polysaccharides keegstra et al 1973 fry 1989 hayashi 1989 indirect linkages between xyg and cellulose microfibrils were first proposed by keegstra and his colleagues 1973 in this early cell wall model from studies on sycamore cells xyg was proposed to be hydrogenbonded to the surface of cellulose microfibrils and covalently attached to a pectin crosslinking network that was in turn covalently attached to other xyg chains that were hydrogenbonded to the surface of other cellulose microfibrils alternatively xyg has been proposed to tether cellulose microfibrils by acting as the sole crosslink by binding to the surface of two different microfibrils or by being intercalated within multiple microfibrils during the crystallization of cellulose microfibrils fry 1989 hayashi 1989 this xygcellulose network is imbedded within a pectin matrix this tethered network model is widely cited and supported by in vitro binding data by microscopic visualization and by enzyme digestion experiments hayashi and maclachlan 1984 hayashi et al 1987 mccann et al 1990 pauly et al 1999 yuan et al 2001 in one supporting study expansins induced creep more effectively when supplemented with a fungal endoglucanase that digests xyg yuan et al 2001 in a transmission electron microscopy tem study cell wall polymers were observed to crosslink cellulose microfibrils these polymers were proposed to be xyg because alkali treatment abolished detectable crosslinks and endoglucanase treatment reduced observable crosslinks mccann et al 1990 yuan et al 2001 the identities of the polysaccharide crosslinks that have been visualized are inferred in a subtractive manner by analyzing which treatment abolishes crosslinks direct immunological labeling of xyg might aid in determining the identity of the crosslinks between cellulose microfibrils recent findings challenge the tethered network model the primary walls of many dicot plants including celery potato and carrot and of monocot grasses have such a small amount of xyloglucan that it is not enough to coat cellulose microfibrils in their entirety stevens and selvendran 1984 thimm et al 2002 zykwinska et al 2005 also nmr studies have detected limited xygcellulose interactions in arabidopsis primary walls dickperez et al 2011 moreover the xxt1xxt2 mutant which lacked detectable xyg displayed a relatively mild phenotype suggesting that the loadbearing function might not only be assumed by xygcellulose interactions but also by interactions between other wall polymers and cellulose cavalier et al 2008 park and cosgrove 2012b in the absence of xyg pectins and arabinoxylan assume a larger share of the mechanical load of the wall zykwinska et al 2005 dickperez et al 2011 recent studies suggest that up to onethird of the total xyg in the wall of suspensioncultured rose cells is covalently attached to acidic pectins thompson and fry 2000 this is consistent with the idea that loadbearing function is not exclusively dependent on cellulosexyg tethering but also on the covalent binding between pectin and hemicelluloses pauly et al 1999 thompson and fry 2000 recent experiments using cell walldegrading enzymes revealed that cell wall loosening requires enzymes with dual specificities to cut both xyg and cellulose park and cosgrove 2012a a revised primary cell wall model was proposed in which loadbearing xyg is located in limited regions of tight contact between cellulose microfibrils this revised model is conceptually different from the tethered network model such that rather than spanning 2040 nm of space between adjacent cellulose microfibrils loadbearing xyg acts as an adhesive layer to connect two adjacent cellulose microfibrils that are bundled together at biomechanical hotspots figure 1a with everimproving models of the cell wall matrix interactions a better understanding of cell wall loosening mechanisms which allow turgordriven cell expansion to occur continues to develop potential in muro cell wall loosening mechanisms involving expansins xyloglucan endotransglucosylasehydrolases endoglucanases cellulases hydroxyl radicals and pectin modification have been reviewed elsewhere cosgrove 2005 peaucelle et al 2012 wolf and greiner 2012 recently experiments using sensitivityenhanced solidstate nuclear magnetic resonance ssnmr spectroscopy have provided a putative mode of action for expansins in cell wall loosening wang et al 2013b in this study 13c and 15nlabeled bacterial expansin was shown to selectively bind to cellulose in xygenriched areas within 13clabeled cell wall extracts from arabidopsis the binding of expansins is believed to weaken the interactions between the polysaccharides to induce creep in the cell wall interestingly this model of expansinmediated loosening is consistent with the recently proposed biomechanical hotspot model of cellulosexyg interaction park and cosgrove 2012a wang et al 2013b a more complete understanding of the biosynthesis of cell wall polymers and the network of interactions between cell wall polymers will continue to cause refinements of the cell wall matrix model and improve our understanding of cell wall expansion mechanisms microtubules arrangement and cell wall architecture the pioneering work of roelofsen and houwink 1951 1953 showed that cellulose microfibrils were laid down in a transverse orientation that is perpendicular to the growth axis at the inner primary cell wall layer of tradescantia stamen hairs thereby establishing the basis of the multinet growth hypothesis mgh the mgh was later expanded to explain the cell wall architecture in various cell types green 1960 roelofsen 1965 the mgh proposes that new layers of cellulose microfibrils are continuously deposited in a transverse orientation at the innermost cell wall layer that is adjacent to the pm and that older layers of cellulose microfibrils that are farther from the pm reorient gradually during cell growth thereby a gradient develops in which cellulose microfibrils are transverse in the inner layers oblique in the intermediate layers and longitudinal in the outmost layers of the cell wall the arrangement of cortical microtubules which lie just beneath the pm are oriented in parallel to cellulose microfibrils at the innermost layer of the cell wall in various cell types which is consistent with the mgh hepler and newcomb 1964 quader et al 1987 seagull 1991 baskin 2001 along with the observation that disruption of the cortical microtubules disorganizes the pattern of cellulose microfibril deposition a microtubulemicrofibril alignment hypothesis was formed to explain the causative relationship between microtubules and cellulose microfibrils which will be discussed in a later section the mgh does not however explain the existence of crossedpolylamellate wall patterns where layers of neartransverse microfibrils alternate with layers of nearlongitudinal microfibrils crossedpolylamellate walls have been observed in filamentous green algae and in plant tissues that provide mechanical support such as phloem fibers sclerenchyma tracheids and the epidermis chafe and doohan 1972 chafe and wardrop 1972b itoh 1975 itoh and shimaji 1976 however in contrast to discontinuously alternating transverse and longitudinal orientations that were proposed to occur in crossedpolylamellate walls roland et al 1982 were able to observe multiangle cellulose microfibrils by using a silver proteinate staining method to label cellulose microfibrils that changed orientation gradually it was suggested that the intermediate cellulose layers existed within crossedpolylamellate walls that created helical wall patterns although the helical wall patterns could be observed using the silver proteinate staining method they may have been missed in earlier thick em sections arrays of microtubules have been shown to undergo similar rhythmic cycles of gradual rotary reorientation between transverse and longitudinal orientations that are consistent with the gradual changes in cellulose microfibril orientation in each layer of the cell wall chan et al 2007 in arabidopsis epidermal cells of the root elongation zone measurements of cellulose microfibril rotation rates suggest that it takes more than 9 h for cellulose microfibrils to rotate from a transverse to a longitudinal orientation anderson et al 2010 in lightgrown hypocotyl epidermal cells the rate of microtubule rotation varied considerably on a cell to cell basis taking about 200800 min to rotate through 360 reflecting different physical characteristics in different regions that may have been influenced by the cell elongation rate chan et al 2007 the biophysical theory that supports the concept of transverse hoop reinforcement suggests that transverse microtubule arrangement would better accommodate rapid cell elongation and that microtubule reorientation from transverse to oblique or longitudinal is more likely to occur when cells slow their growth lloyd 2011 however transverse microtubules are not always correlated with a rapid growth rate in most cases microtubule reorientation follows a decrease of growth rate suggesting that microtubule reorientation is not a prerequisite for a decrease of growth rate chan et al 2011 crowell et al 2011 the independent factors that regulate microtubule orientation may be sensitive to the growth acceleration deceleration rather than growth itself while it remains to be determined how microtubule orientation is regulated it is evident that the rotation of the cellulose microfibril deposition is dependent on microtubule rotation as both microtubulestabilizing taxol and microtubuledepolymerizing oryzalin stopped the rotation of the cellulose synthase trajectories chan et al 2007 2011 crowell et al 2011 importantly the study of chan et al suggests that the dynamicity of microtubules drives their own rotation rather than a passive mechanism of rotation that stems from feedback from cell wall selfassembly although these findings did not take several factors into account including the incorporation of other wall polymers turgordriven expansion and other biophysical forces it is clear that microtubules play a primary role in determining the overall pattern of wall architecture during initial cellulose deposition by cellulose synthase complexes since the growth rate of a given cell is not strictly correlated with the orientation of its microtubules or cellulose microfibrils a broader approach that investigates the behavior of microtubules and cellulose microfibrils between neighboring cells or within inner tissue layers rather than within a single cell may be more informative in this regard it has been postulated that the wall of the inner face of epidermal cells plays a different role than the wall of the outer face of the same cells recent studies suggest that microtubules and cellulose synthase trajectories show parallel transverse orientation on the inner face of epidermal cells in hypocotyls whereas microtubules and cellulose synthase trajectories on the outer face of the same epidermal cells have variable orientations chan et al 2011 crowell et al 2011 a model has been established in which the microtubules of internal cells and of the inner face of epidermal cells control the anisotropic growth direction orienting perpendicular to the growth axis,the plant cell wall is primarily composed of cellulose hemicellulose pectin and proteins its structure must be both strong and flexible to support growth and cell expansion cellulose is synthesized at the plasma membrane while noncellulosic polysaccharides like hemicellulose and pectin are assembled in the golgi and interact with cellulose microfibrils to form the cell wall matrix xyloglucan xyg a significant hemicellulose in dicots forms crosslinks with cellulose either directly or through pectin intermediates contributing to wall flexibility and strength traditional models suggested xyg directly connects cellulose microfibrils however recent studies propose that xyg acts as an adhesive layer between microfibrils with pectin also playing a role in loadbearing the interaction between xyg pectin and cellulose influences wall mechanical properties supporting cell expansion and flexibility microtubules which align with cellulose microfibrils guide their orientation within the cell wall reinforcing its structure studies reveal that microtubules undergo gradual reorientation correlating with cell growth and elongation phases this dynamic interplay helps regulate the orientation and deposition of cellulose impacting wall strength and adaptability during plant growth
cell expansion and hormonal regulation many hormones control cell expansion which is accompanied by a change in microtubule organization in many cases early studies using pea stem and etiolated pea internodes suggest that ethylene induces radial cell expansion primarily through an effect on the reorientation of cellulose microfibrils from a transverse to a longitudinal orientation steen and chadwick 1981 lang et al 1982 microtubules were also observed to reorient upon ethylene treatment and treatment with the microtubuledepolymerizing drug colchicine reversed the effects of ethylene treatment steen and chadwick 1981 a similar reorientation of microtubules to a predominantly longitudinal orientation was observed upon treatment with abscisic acid and cytokinins sakiyama and shibaoka 1990 shibaoka 1994 the effect of auxin gibberellins ga and brassinosteroids brs on the elongation of hypocotyls and on the orientation of microtubules appear to be opposite to that of ethylene shibaoka 1993 fujino et al 1995 le et al 2005 polko et al 2012 wang et al 2012 it remains unclear whether hormoneinduced microtubule reorientation is always accompanied by reorientation of cellulose microfibrils at least in shortterm hormone treatments within 2h induced cell elongation might not involve concomitant reorientation of microtubules and cellulose microfibrils shibaoka 1994 for example microtubuledisrupting agents such as colchicine or ethyl nphenylcarbamate do not inhibit iaainduced cell elongation in azuki bean epicotyls shibaoka 1972 shibaoka and hogetsu 1977 moreover treatment with the cellulose synthesis inhibitor 26dichlorobenzonitrile does not inhibit auxininduced cell elongation in maize coleoptiles hogetsu et al 1974b edelmann et al 1989 however gainduced microtubule reorientation is reversed by microtubuledisrupting agents and by inhibitors of cellulose synthesis indicating that hormoneinduced microtubule reorientation involves different and complex mechanisms shibaoka 1972 hogetsu et al 1974a shibaoka and hogetsu 1977 progress has been made in understanding how brs control cell expansion particularly in hypocotyl cell elongation brs act through the pm receptorlike kinase bri1 to activate members of the brassinazoleresistant bzr family of transcription factors sun et al 2010 brdeficientinsensitive mutants affect hypocotyl cell elongation for example the br biosynthesisdeficient mutant det2 and br receptor mutant bri1 have shorter darkgrown hypocotyls whereas the dominant bzr1 mutant bzr11d has longer darkgrown hypocotyls chory et al 1991 li et al 1996 wang et al 2002 2012 the observation that bri1 mutants had reduced expression of xyloglucan endotransglucosylasehydrolase xth 22 and 24 raised the hypothesis that br might control cell expansion by changing the mechanical properties of cell walls kauschmann et al 1996 consistently with this hypothesis brassinolidetreated soybean epicotyl sections showed increased cell wall extensibility zurek and clouse 1994 recent studies utilizing global expression profiling showed that brs induce the expression of seven xths two pectin lyaselike plls and seven expansins exps guo et al 2009 moreover two bzr1 targets herk1 receptor kinase and theseus1 the1 receptor kinase are required for brinduced expression of one xth and five exps guo et al 2009 some evidence also suggests that br signaling affects microtubule organization darkgrown hypocotyls treated with exogenous brassinolide showed reorientation of microtubules in det2 mutants but not in bri1 mutants indicating that reorientation of microtubules from longitudinal to transverse orientation is regulated by br signaling wang et al 2012 this study also identified microtubuledestabilizing protein 40 mdp40 as a bzr1 target and as a positive regulator in brmediated hypocotyl cell elongation however overexpression of mdp40 only partially rescued the det2 hypocotyl phenotype therefore it remains to be determined whether mdp40 mediates cortical microtubule orientation by destabilizing microtubules and whether reorientation of microtubules through brmediated signaling has any effect on cellulose microfibril organization interestingly although hypocotyl elongation is dramatically affected in det2 and bri1 hypocotyls cellulose content in det2 and bri1 mutants was only reduced by about 35 xie et al 2011 thus it is unlikely that the defect in cell elongation is attributed entirely to deficient cellulose biosynthesis recently bri1 was identified to be a suppressor of a pectin methylesterase inhibitor overexpression pmeiox line in a forward genetics screen pmeiox presumably compromises cell wall integrity sensing signaling more than it affects cell wall mechanics by altering the pectin methylesterification patterns this study suggests that a feedback mechanism exists in which br balances cell wall homeostasis wolf et al 2012b figure 1b cell wall integrity sensing during cell expansion a delicate balance between cell wall biosynthesis and cell wall remodeling needs to be maintained such that cell walls are loosened enough to allow turgordriven cell wall extension to occur but not so much that the integrity of the cell is jeopardized in principle a sensing mechanism is needed that allows cells to monitor functional and structural alterations in the cell wall and translate them into cellular responses in yeast a cell wall integrity cwi sensing mechanism has been characterized in great detail the cwi signaling pathway is initiated at the pm by the cell surface sensors wsc mid and mtl and transduced to the downstream targets through a rho gtpase and a map kinase cascade levin 2005 plants do not have obvious homologs of yeast cell surface sensors such as wsc mid and mtl but emerging evidence suggests that plants do have signaling pathways that lie between cwi and growth control xu et al 2008 guo et al 2009 tsang et al 2011 potential cell surface sensors in plants include several members of the receptorlike serthr proteinkinase rlk family wallassociated kinases waks are the only known rlks that directly bind to polysaccharides in the wall waks are composed of an extracellular epidermal growth factorlike repeat domain a transmembrane region and a cytosolic serthr kinase domain the extracellular domain of wak1 binds to calcium crosslinked pectinderived oligogalacturonides ogs in vitro decreux and messiaen 2005 decreux et al 2006 experiments using a chimera between wak1 and efr a receptor for recognition of the microbeassociated molecular pattern eftu demonstrated that wak1 is a receptor of ogs in vivo brutus et al 2010 the perception of ogs through wak1 together with genetic evidence that waks are involved in cell elongation stress tolerance and pathogen resistance indicates that wak1 is a potential sensor for cell wall signaling lally et al 2001 wagner and kohorn 2001 diener and ausubel 2005 kohorn et al 2006 li et al 2009 figure 1b in addition to waks several members of the rlks have been implicated in cwi sensing a mutation in a pm rlk of the crrlk1 catharanthus roseus proteinkinase1like family member thesesus1 the1 was identified in a suppressor screen of cesa6prc1 that suppressed a set of growth phenotypes including hypocotyl growth inhibition ectopic lignin accumulation and altered transcript levels for a number of genes without recovering the cellulose content deficiency of cesa6prc1 hematy et al 2007 moreover the1 suppressed hypocotyl growth inhibition in other cellulosedeficient mutants including cesa3eli1 cesa1rsw1 and pompom1 suggesting that the perturbation of cellulose synthesis leads to activation of the1 it has been proposed that the1 is part of a surveillance system in growing cells and that the1 is activated upon cell wall perturbation and in turn results in the activation of downstream target genes that control cell elongation and defense against pathogens hematy et al 2007 hematy and hofte 2008 the ligand of the1 and details of the signaling cascade of the1mediated integrity sensing remains to be determined figure 1b fei1 and fei2 belong to rlk subfamily xiii which is distinct from the wak and the1 subfamilies genetic evidence suggests that fei1 and fei2 are required for anisotropic cell expansion in nonpermissive conditions such as high sucrose or high salt xu et al 2008 interestingly although fei1 and fei2 have kinase activity kinase inactive versions of fei1 or fei2 complemented the fei1fei2 mutant phenotype which suggests the kinase activity of fei1 and fei2 is dispensable distinct from the1 fei1fei2 exhibits cellulose biosynthesis deficiencies under nonpermissive conditions and feifei2prc and fei1fei2cob triple mutants display enhanced root phenotypes suggesting that fei1 and fei2 act in a pathway that is distinct from cell wall surveillance sensing although fei1 and fei2 interact with acs5 an enzyme responsible for the synthesis of the ethylene precursor acc ethylene production in fei1fei2 is not drastically different from that of wildtype interestingly the fei1fei2 root swelling and cellulose deficiency phenotypes can be reverted by blocking ethylene biosynthesis using either aminoisobutyric acid aib or aminooxyacetic acid aoa but not by blocking ethylene perception this evidence provides a model in which fei1 and fei2 function as a scaffold to localize and assemble the acs complex which in turn generates a localized acc signal to regulate cell wall biosynthesis xu et al 2008 figure 1b if this model can be supported it may represent an unconventional accdependent mechanism that acts independently from ethylene signaling to test this cell wallsensing mechanism tsang et al 2011 induced cell wall perturbations by shortterm treatments with the cellulose synthesis inhibitor isoxaben or the cellulosebinding dye congo red in combination with treatments with acc biosynthesis inhibitors or ethylene perception inhibitors and compared the effects on cell elongation while isoxaben treatment caused a reduction in cell elongation in control seedlings in seedlings treated with silver ions to block ethylene perception and in the ethyleneinsensitive mutant ein3eil1 isoxaben treatment did not significantly change cell elongation in roots treated with the acc biosynthesis inhibitor aminoethoxyvinylglycine avg tsang et al 2011 although it could be argued that some acc biosynthesis inhibitors are promiscuous these data are consistent with the work of xu et al and suggest that isoxabeninduced inhibition is accdependent but not dependent on ethylene perception and that cwi sensing involves a novel noncanonical signaling function of acc interestingly the isoxabeninduced acute growth response does not require fei1 fei2 and the1 other rlks involved in cell wall function include prorich extensionlike receptor kinase perk 4 strubbelig sub and sub receptor family srf lrrrlks erecta er and erectalike erl lrrrlks and leguminous ltype lectin rlks haffani et al 2006 eyuboglu et al 2007 bai et al 2009 bouwmeester and govers 2009 sanchezrodriguez et al 2009 figure 1b however the current studies are in their infancy and it is too early to assign specific signaling roles to those rlks it is anticipated that many aspects of cwi sensing will continue to emerge including identification of elusive signals kinase cascades and downstream targets it is important to note that signaling pathways are often complex and converge with many other signaling pathways and biological functions therefore the effects of any particular signaling pathway on cellulose biosynthesis are not necessarily a direct effect of the stimulus of study unless the pathway is exhaustively studied,cell expansion is intricately regulated by hormones with significant effects on microtubule organization ethylene induces radial cell expansion by reorienting cellulose microfibrils from transverse to longitudinal as demonstrated in pea stems this reorientation is accompanied by changes in microtubule organization which can be reversed by colchicine treatment abscisic acid and cytokinins also influence microtubule orientation contrasting with auxins gibberellins gas and brassinosteroids brs which affect hypocotyl elongation differently brassinosteroids control cell expansion via the bri1 receptor activating brassinazoleresistant bzr transcription factors brdeficient mutants exhibit reduced hypocotyl elongation while bzr1 overexpression promotes it studies indicate brs enhance the expression of cell wall remodeling enzymes suggesting their role in modulating mechanical properties of cell walls cell wall integrity cwi sensing involves receptorlike kinases rlks such as wallassociated kinases waks which respond to changes in cell wall composition other rlks like the1 and fei proteins are crucial for sensing cell wall integrity during expansion and play roles in growth regulation and stress responses
cellulose hemicellulose and pectin synthesis and trafficking intracellular trafficking of cell wall material and cell wallmodifying or biosynthesizing machinery to and from the pm is critical to the synthesis dynamicity and architecture of the extracellular cell wall hemicellulose and pectin polysaccharides are synthesized in the lumen of the golgi before being secreted to the apoplast cosgrove 2005 driouich et al 2012 worden et al 2012 figure 2 the position of noncellulosic polymer exocytosis in relation to the sites of cellulose biosynthesizing cscs has been proposed to influence the physical properties of the cell wall and the efficiency of cell expansion fujita et al 2012 internalization of hemicellulose and pectin back into the cell may also be an important process in cell wall remodeling baluska et al 2002 samaj et al 2004 baluska et al 2005 since cellulose biosynthesis is thought to occur exclusively at the pm control of the abundance of cscs at the pm through exocytosis and endocytosis likely acts as a mechanism by which cellulose incorporation in the cell wall is modulated recently the development of new technologies including a system in which cesas can be visualized in living cells methods for labeling specific cell wall polysaccharides for fluorescence and immunogold imaging and largescale proteomic and oligosaccharide analyses on isolated plant fractions has great potential in detailing the trafficking routes and mechanisms of cell wall polysaccharides and cell wallbiosynthesizing and modifying enzymes the importance of proper trafficking in the maintenance of cwi and proper cell expansion has been exhibited through genetic studies in which trafficking is disturbed disruption of the tgneelocalized hatpase vhaa1 causes a disruption in both endocytic and secretory trafficking which leads to a cell elongation defect and cellulose deficiency dettmer et al 2006 brux et al 2008 a mutation in echidna a tgnlocalized protein that is critical for postgolgi trafficking causes intracellular accumulation of xyg and pectin and a consequential decrease of these polysaccharides in the cell wall gendre et al 2013 as a result the echidna mutant displays a severe dwarfism phenotype and a cell elongation defect that stems from deficiencies in cell wall polysaccharides gendre et al 2011 2013 a mutation in ap1m2 hap13 a subunit of an adaptor protein complex ap1 that is involved in clathrinmediated trafficking away from the tgn causes a cell elongation and a dwarf phenotype that is similar to that of the echidna mutants park et al 2013 teh et al 2013 wang et al 2013a although the cell wall composition of ap1m2hap13 mutants has not been investigated it is possible that these phenotypes stem from inadequate secretion of cell wall polysaccharides it is important to note that in mutants with widespread defects in trafficking a combination of many factors may be at play to contribute to the cell wall defects that are observed including but not limited to direct affects on the trafficking of cell wall polymers and cell wall biosynthesizing and modifying enzymes changes in cell wall ph disruption of hormone or signaling pathways that affect the cell wall and other pleiotropic effects on plant cell health live cell imaging of fluorescent protein fplabeled cesas using spinning disk confocal microscopy has been influential in the analysis of cesa localization and behavior as well as the association of cesa with other proteinscapabilities that may aid in detailing cesa trafficking routes and mechanisms paredez et al 2006 crowell et al 2009 gutierrez et al 2009 bringmann et al 2012 li et al 2012a bashline et al 2013 sampathkumar et al 2013 in agreement with the localization of rosette structures in transmission electron micrographs of freeze fracture replicas haigler and brown 1986 fpcesas localize to intracellular golgi bodies and to distinct foci at the pm that travel laterally in the plane of the membrane at constant velocities along linear trajectories paredez et al 2006 microtubuleassociated cellulose synthase compartments mascs and small cesacontaining compartments smaccs have also been described and have been speculated to represent vesicles containing cesas that are being delivered to andor internalized from the pm crowell et al 2009 gutierrez et al 2009 figure 2 cortical smaccs mascs display episodes of static behavior interrupted by episodes of rapid dynamics that can be attributed to the tracking of depolymerizing microtubule ends and a subcortical population of smaccsmascs has also been described that moves in an actindependent manner sampathkumar et al 2013 the distribution of fpcesas to smaccsmascs can be induced by various conditions including osmotic stress and treatment with cellulose biosynthesis inhibitors but a few smaccs mascs are also detectable without treatment the dense population of pmlocalized cesas in native conditions may hinder the detection of smaccsmascs care should be taken in the interpretation of the role of smaccsmascs especially when inferring the function of all smaccsmascs based on the behavior of smaccsmascs that have been induced by artificial treatments fpcesas have also been documented to colocalize with markers of the transgolgi networkearly endosome tgnee crowell et al 2009 it is unclear whether tgneelocalized fpcesas are in the secretion or endocytic pathway because the tgnee has been shown to be a single compartment that is part of both the secretion and endocytic pathways in arabidopsis dettmer et al 2006 viotti et al 2010 although cesas have been visualized in several compartments much ambiguity remains in the function of several compartments and in understanding the mechanisms by which cesas are allocated to different locations recently a study by our group unveiled one mechanism by which cesa proteins are endocytosed bashline et al 2013 figure 2 in this study the medium subunit of the clathrinmediated endocytosis cme adaptor protein ap2 complex 2 ap2m was characterized as a significant player in cme and in the internalization of cesa proteins from the pm upon endocytosis cesas are likely trafficked to the tgnee but the dual function of the tgnee in the secretion and endocytic pathways complicates the analysis of whether cesas are subsequently recycled back to the pm or destined for degradation the sheer magnitude of the amount of protein dedicated to the formation of a single cesa complex would lend support to the idea that cscs are recycled from the tgnee back to the pm the mechanism by which cesas are trafficked from the tgnee remains unsolved a 2 homolog ap1m2hap13 has recently been implicated in trafficking away from the tgn park et al 2013 teh et al 2013 wang et al 2013a it remains to be investigated whether ap1m2 plays a role in clathrinmediated secretion of cesas in addition the dissection of the molecular components that comprise the smacc masc compartment may lead to the identification of new secretion or endocytosis mechanisms for cesas or to the establishment of smaccsmascs as intermediate vesicles between the tgnee and the pm the importance of the cytoskeleton in csc trafficking has been addressed by several studies crowell et al 2009 gutierrez et al 2009 sampathkumar et al 2013 actin has been shown to be important for the cellwide distribution of cesacontaining golgi bodies through its role in cytoplasmic streaming crowell et al 2009 gutierrez et al 2009 pharmacological loss of actin leads to the aggregation of immobile cesacontaining golgi bodies and a distribution pattern of pmlocalized cscs that is limited to an area that is in close proximity to the immobile golgi body aggregates crowell et al 2009 gutierrez et al 2009 genetic disruption of actin has also been shown to reduce the delivery rate of cscs to the pm and to increase the lifetime of cscs at the pm suggesting that actin might play a role in the exocytosis and endocytosis of cscs sampathkumar et al 2013 in addition to the important role of cortical microtubules in guiding pmlocalized cscs motility during cellulose biosynthesis paredez et al 2006 gu et al 2010 fujita et al 2011 li et al 2012a cortical microtubules have also been shown to mark the sites of csc insertion at the pm crowell et al 2009 gutierrez et al 2009 figure 2 pharmacological disruption of cortical microtubules did not affect the delivery rate of cscs to the pm gutierrez et al 2009 although cortical microtubules are not necessary for the delivery of cscs cortical microtubules play a role in organizing the insertion of cscs if the cortical microtubules similarly organize the sites of hemicellulose and pectin exocytosis the cortical microtubules might act in targeting all of the nascent cell wall material to a common location to encourage the incorporation of all of the polysaccharide cell wall components into the nascent cell wall matrix at the point of cellulose crystallization the incorporation of noncellulosic polysaccharides into a crystallizing cellulose microfibril has been hypothesized to reduce the cellulose crystallinity and may be dependent upon the microtubuleassisted organization of nascent cell wall polymers fujita et al 2012 in support of this hypothesis temperaturesensitive microtubule organization 1 mor1 mutants which display cell expansion defects that stem from reduced cortical microtubule density and dynamics synthesize cellulose of higher crystallinity when at the restrictive temperature whittington et al 2001 kawamura and wasteneys 2008 fujita et al 2011 2012 the decreased density of cortical microtubules in mor1 leads to an increased number of nonmicrotubuleassociated cscs which might consequently lead to higher cellulose crystallinity due to the inefficient targeting of noncellulosic polysaccharides to the sites of cellulose biosynthesis and crystallization fujita et al 2012 while this hypothesis represents just one putative explanation for the observations of increased cellulose crystallinity of the mor1 mutants it shows the many ways in which trafficking can influence characteristics of the cell wall and cell expansion the development of new technologies might help to better analyze the influence of trafficking on hemicellulose and pectin biosynthesis and delivery the localization of hemicellulose and pectin in plant golgi compartments was first discovered using biochemical staining techniques pickettheaps 1968 and later the role of the golgi in the synthesis of these polysaccharides was implied from the cofractionation of polymers containing radiolabeled sugars with golgi fractions harris and northcote 1971 many antibodies have been developed that recognize various polysaccharide epitopes pattathil et al 2010 which can be helpful in dissecting the sequential maturation of hemicellulose and pectin polymers with subcompartment resolution within golgi bodies using immunogold electron microscopy lynch and staehelin 1992 zhang and staehelin 1992 the progressive maturation of polymer synthesis might be interesting to observe in conjunction with immunogold localization of specific glycosyltransferases gts involved in hemicellulose or pectin biosynthesis chevalier et al 2010 driouich et al 2012 the model of progressive maturation of cell wall polysaccharide biosynthesis raises interesting questions relating to trafficking for instance how are the gts that are responsible for particular stages in polysaccharide biosynthesis segregated to and subsequently maintained in different golgi stacks expanding immunological imaging techniques to the analysis of postgolgi secretory vesicles toyooka et al 2009 might be useful in detailing whether hemicellulose and pectin share secretory vesicles with one another with cesas andor with cell wall modifying enzymes such as xyg endotransglucosylases xets expansins or endoglucanases more recently several new approaches to investigating hemicellulose and pectin have been developed that may also be suitable for using to investigate the postgolgi trafficking of cell wall polysaccharides,intracellular trafficking of cell wall materials is essential for the dynamic synthesis and architecture of the extracellular cell wall hemicellulose and pectin are synthesized in the golgi apparatus before being secreted into the apoplast the positioning of noncellulosic polymers during exocytosis can influence cell wall properties and expansion efficiency additionally the internalization of hemicellulose and pectin contributes to cell wall remodeling cellulose synthesis occurs exclusively at the plasma membrane pm where the abundance of cellulose synthase complexes cscs is regulated by exocytosis and endocytosis disruptions in trafficking such as mutations in key proteins can lead to significant cell elongation defects and cellulose deficiencies recent advancements in imaging technologies allow for livecell visualization of csc localization and movement revealing intricate trafficking routes actin and microtubules play vital roles in the distribution and insertion of cscs suggesting that cytoskeletal organization may affect the incorporation of noncellulosic polysaccharides into the cell wall matrix research using immunogold techniques has begun to uncover the dynamics of hemicellulose and pectin synthesis and trafficking highlighting the need for further exploration of how polysaccharides are segregated and maintained during biosynthesis
strigolactones karrikins and more newly discovered molecules light up plant signaling strigolactones sls are a group of small carotenoidderived molecules recently discovered not only to influence shoot and root architecture as plant hormones but also to regulate symbiotic and parasitic interactions as rhizosphere signals karrikins kars a class of signaling molecules discovered from the smoke of burning plant material that can stimulate germination of seeds of firefollowing plant species and enhance seedling photomorphogenesis are butenolide compounds with structural similarity to sls since the classification of sls as plant hormones inhibiting shoot branching in 2008 much has been learned about the biosynthetic pathway of sls and the perception and signaling mechanisms of sls as well as kars have been extensively at the same concentration as gr24 based on this finding the authors proposed a potential strategy combining the agricultural application of 4bd with sldeficient plants to control root parasitic weeds fukui et al 2013 the stereochemical features of natural sls are important for their biological activities xie et al 2013 conducted a comprehensive characterization of major natural sls in rice and tobacco plants by determining their stereochemical structures and found that rice produces only orobancholtype sls but tobacco produces natural sls of both families xie et al 2013 highlighting the importance of structural determination of natural sls in plants the review article by flematti et al 2013 discussed multiple aspects of two new types of signaling compounds kars and cyanohydrins which were discovered in the smoke of wildfires to stimulate seed germination and enhance seedling photomorphogenesis as reviewed the signaling pathway of kars is connected with that of sls via a common component max2 which encodes an fbox protein critical for regulating shoot branching however the kar and sl signaling pathways can be distinguished by the upstream sensor proteins kars are sensed by the hydrolase kai2 a homolog of putative sl receptor d14atd14dad2 flematti et al 2013 both max2 and kai2 are essential for normal lightdependent seedling development however sl and karregulated seedling photomorphogenesis via the kai2 and max2 defined pathway was found to be largely independent of hy5 a key transcription factor crucial for lightresponsive gene expression in the downstream of phytochromes and cryptochromes waters and smith 2013 indicating other light signaling factors or pathways downstream of the photoreceptors are involved in addition to kars cyanohydrins also act as the postfire signals to stimulate seed germination probably by releasing cyanide upon hydrolysis cyanide may act as a signaling molecule via interactions with other signaling pathways involving nitric oxide reactive oxygen species and ethylene although the precise mechanisms need to be resolved flematti et al 2013 in summary this special issue might have provided the readers of molecular plant with a broad range of knowledge about sls and kars that is beneficial for the community to develop the related researches to new frontiers intriguingly recent studies revealed that max2 mediates sl signaling by targeting d53 a repressor of sl signaling in rice and bes1 a transcription factor of the brassinosteroid pathway in arabidopsis for proteasomemediated degradation jiang et al 2013 wang et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 indicating that sl signaling may be more complex than we thought previously more studies are needed to further dissect the perception and downstream regulatory networks of sl signaling as well as signaling pathways of other newly discovered molecules such as kars and cyanohydrins in both monocot and dicot plants moreover many other endogenous signaling molecules are waiting to be identified and characterized in plants for example by developing a bioassay based on the cell cycle marker pcycb11gus adhikari et al 2013 suggested that the nature of the longsought bps signal which is produced in arabidopsis roots but acts as a mobile signaling molecules to regulate shoot development might be a metabolite awaiting identification adhikari et al 2013 future studies on various kinds of signaling molecules in plants using the integrative approaches will shed new light on not only plant biology but also chemical biology studied in plants in this context molecular plant published a special issue volume 6 number 1 entitled new signaling molecules in 2013 which focused on sls and kars and had been freely accessible online since january 2014 this themed issue organized by drs hinanit koltai and christine beveridge collected three excellent reviews and eight outstanding research articles the review article by brewer et al 2013 analyzed the multifaceted roles of sls in plant development including shaping shoot and root architecture modifying plant growth in response to suboptimal conditions such as phosphate starvation and nitrogen deficiency and regulating lightrelated responses such as shade avoidance moreover this review discussed the action model of sls and their crosstalk with auxin and cytokinin in regulating shoot branching brewer et al 2013 as one class of endogenous hormones the prominent role of sls in inhibiting shoot branching has been under intensive investigations in diverse plant species for example in this issue dun et al 2013 reported that sls function dynamically to regulate shoot branching in pea by directly inhibiting the axillary bud initiation and outgrowth using the sldeficient pea mutants combined with the treatment of gr24 a widely used synthetic analog of sls they found that gr24 acted in a psbrc1dependent manner but did not require an apical or basal auxin supply dun et al 2013 another key role of sls is to regulate plant symbiosis foo et al 2013 examined the roles of the sl synthetic and responsive pathways in regulating both mycorrhizal and rhizobial symbioses in pea in addition to activating the arbuscular mycorrhizal am fungi as rhizosphere signals their results indicate that both the synthesis and response of sls are required for promoting mycorrhizal colonization but not for regulating the symbiosis in response to nutrient deficiency foo et al 2013 the review article by flematti et al 2013 analyzed the molecular features of naturally occurring sls sl analogs and sl mimics natural sls can be classified into two families based on the orientation of cring in their stereochemical structures orobancholtype sls with oriented cring and strigoltype sls with oriented cring the total synthesis strategies of representative natural sls were discussed and basic principles for designing active sl analogs were proposed more importantly the structureactivity relationships and action models of sls were analyzed in depth in terms of several typical biological assays flematti et al 2013 these aspects of sl research were also touched by several research articles in this issue in one study cohen et al 2013 examined the biological activities of several sl analogs by assaying arabidopsis roothair elongation orobanche seed germination and am hyphal branching the differences of sensitivity to sl analogs between arabidopsis orobanche and am fungi suggest there are different receptors or distinct receptor affinities in different species the structureactivity relations of sl analog molecules may be also different in each system cohen et al 2013 in another report prandi et al 2013 described the design and synthesis of three types of fluorescentlabeled sl analogs bearing different fluorophores and explored them as probes for detecting the sl receptor and tracking their behaviors in living cells one type of sl analogs designed as bodipy derivates was found to be most promising prandi et al 2013 moreover rasmussen et al 2013 reported the development of a novel efficient method for synthesizing another fluorescentlabeled sl analog designed as cisa1 presumably because of its higher stability cisa1 showed stronger biological activities than gr24 in several assays despite the similar capacity in inhibiting arabidopsis shoot branching suggesting that it can be used as an alternative to gr24 rasmussen et al 2013 in addition fukui et al 2013 reported the discovery of a new phenoxyfuranone compound 4bromodebranone 4bd that functions as a plantspecific sl mimic although it could not stimulate seed germination of root parasitic weeds 4bd did affect shoot and root architecture of sldeficient plants,strigolactones sls and karrikins kars are newly discovered signaling molecules that play significant roles in plant growth and development sls small carotenoidderived molecules function as plant hormones regulating shoot and root architecture while also influencing symbiotic and parasitic interactions karrikins derived from smoke stimulate seed germination and enhance seedling photomorphogenesis research has revealed complex biosynthetic pathways and signaling mechanisms for both sls and kars with the fbox protein max2 mediating sl signaling and kai2 an hydrolase sensing kars both pathways intersect at max2 but have distinct upstream sensors suggesting a layered regulatory network involving light and nutrient responses notable findings include structural diversity natural sls can be classified into orobancholtype and strigoltype based on stereochemical structures impacting their biological activity regulatory mechanisms sls inhibit shoot branching by targeting repressors like d53 and transcription factors such as bes1 indicating a complex interaction with brassinosteroid pathways symbiotic roles sls regulate mycorrhizal and rhizobial symbioses essential for nutrient acquisition in plants while kars and cyanohydrins act as postfire germination signals the ongoing research into these signaling molecules is pivotal for understanding plant biology and developing agricultural applications
landscape design the need for gardens gardens are the pleasure grounds of civilization they date back to the ancient egyptians greeks and romans and perhaps earlier historically gardens have been as much an expression of their owners social status and political power as they have been places for recreation nobility throughout europe asia and africa built gardens on a grand scale often measured in square miles as a way of exhibiting their domination over a hostile natural world in other times and places gardens were developed as tribute to religious figures monastic gardens honored christian martyrs throughout europe and far eastern cultures built gardens to their deities through much of history gardens have belonged to the privileged not the common person today however gardens grow in the middleclass suburbs city centers and on farms they fill public plazas shopping malls and parks the american approach to landscaping is giving new direction to an old profession three major influences have shaped american attitudes toward landscaping 1 the formal tradition of 16th and 17thcentury europe 2 the naturalism of 18thcentury england 3 the nature symbolism of the orient the 16thcentury italian renaissance gardens and the 17thcentury french baroque gardens exemplify the formal tradition in landscape design figure 91 they are characterized by symmetrical layout patterns severe shearing of plants topiary pruning described in chapter 12 the use of ornate fountains and sculpture and an overall architectural quality the gardens left no doubt about the importance of the owners and their ability to dominate the natural world england in the 18th century found its royal court life less formal than that of continental europe also the general attitude of the people toward the natural world was less fearful and more conciliatory as a result the formal garden fell from fashion and a more natural appearance became popular figure 92 natural was defined by the landscape designers however and the style called naturalism required planning as meticulous as that of the most formal gardens the designers of these english naturalism gardens tore out the formal symmetrical gardens with zeal and replaced them with lakes and islands rolling hills pastoral lawns grazing animals and added such picturesque touches as manufactured ruins dead trees hermits cottages and vistas toward distant temples grass was brought right up to the walls of the stately homes a departure from the embroiderylike flower beds that surrounded them in formal gardens straight lines were practically nonexistent in the belief that natures lines are always curvilinear naturalism not only reshaped the landscape of england but reached across the atlantic to influence the public park movement in the united states when frederick law olmstead the dean of american landscape architects joined calvert vaux in the planning the new york citys central park the design concepts of naturalism found new form central park was the first important urban garden created for the pleasure of ordinary people it was and still remains the flagship of the american landscape movement it is a movement that now sets the pace for much that is done worldwide the other major influence on americas landscape style came from the orient principally from china and japan for centuries eastern and western cultures were isolated from each other and developed distinctly different garden styles even today full appreciation of a genuine oriental garden is beyond the comprehension of most europeans and americans who are unfamiliar with the religious and spiritual beliefs of the orient the style of these gardens is based on miniaturization of the natural world within a small garden area carefully screened from the world outside mountains rivers islands clouds animals and forests may all be found components of the natural world are symbolized with materials including sand and stones special pruning techniques and clever land forms animal forms may be shaped with stones rivers and pools may be represented by raked sand ripples may be fixed in time as concentric rings in a pool of sand mountains may be rolling mounds of soil and clouds may be tufted shrubs unlike western gardens usually planned for recreation and entertainment eastern gardens are planned for contemplation and meditation their influence on american gardens can be seen in the use of space and form in pruned yet naturally shaped trees and shrubs in stone as a sculptural form and in certain furnishings figure 93 landscaping today according to countless landscape designers and theorists there is nothing truly new in landscape design our most modern landscapes are eclectic conglomerations of ideas from earlier times and distant places americans have been instrumental in restructuring the landscape profession in a fashion that sets trends worldwide our democratic system recognizes no privileged class of people so gardens are available for everyone in addition to the financial resources to support them more inherent to america is the singlefamily dwelling with its front back and side yards that provide the space for garden development the opportunity for ordinary citizens to own land and to develop it as they choose is unparalleled in most other nations outside of north america it has moved landscape design from a qualitative level to a quantitative level yet since no two properties have the same combination of physical characteristics and user needs the mass reproduction of lookalike landscapes is not as common as might be feared by definition modern landscape design is the arrangement of outdoor space in a way that serves the needs and desires of people without damage to natural ecological relationships dissecting the definition a bit shows that the profession is more service than productoriented the landscape design must first satisfy the people who will use the land therefore the designer must first carefully ascertain the needs of the user population yet in the larger sense ownership of land is temporary and our stewardship of the land mandates that we not make changes that will damage it irreparably and restrict its future use a concern for the environmental impact of a proposed landscape change is a recent and important development in the evolution of the landscape design profession it has added an ethical obligation to a profession whose past concerns have been largely aesthetic and technical,gardens have historically served as expressions of social status and power dating back to ancient civilizations such as egypt greece and rome initially exclusive to the elite gardens have evolved to occupy public spaces suburban neighborhoods and urban areas reflecting changing societal values and accessibility three key influences shaped american landscape design formal tradition rooted in 16th and 17thcentury european styles characterized by symmetrical layouts topiary and ornamental features reflecting the owners dominance over nature naturalism emerging in 18thcentury england this style favored a more relaxed picturesque aesthetic featuring rolling hills lakes and pastoral elements it promoted harmony with nature leading to the design of public parks notably central park which aimed to provide natural beauty for everyone oriental influence eastern gardens particularly those from china and japan focused on the miniaturization of nature emphasizing contemplation over recreation elements like raked sand carefully pruned trees and symbolic forms highlight a deep spiritual connection to nature today landscape design reflects a blend of these historical influences with modern designs focusing on user needs and environmental stewardship while drawing on past ideas contemporary landscaping prioritizes accessibility and ecological balance ensuring that gardens are both functional and sustainable
the outdoor room to serve the needs and desires of clients the landscape designer must take an inventory of their characteristics and their attitudes toward the landscape site necessary information for a residential design might include the clients composition of family that is number gender and ages hobbies and special interests frequency and style of outdoor entertainment attitudes toward outdoor living attitudes toward landscape maintenance attitudes toward privacy attitudes toward their neighbors pets outdoor service needs such as garbage cans dog yard clothes lines storage for garden tools special preferences for plant species and colors use of swimming pool barbecue area music system night lighting special needs because of age young children elderly residents or physical disabilities budget for annual and total expenditures the site of the proposed landscape may or may not support all of the uses desired by the clients it may also offer possibilities not recognized by the clients therefore its initial assessment by the designer should be independent of client input the site analysis may include dimensions of the lot topography elevation variations geology rock formations including the bedrock base and rock outcroppings hydrography surface and underground water and drainage patterns existing vegetation existing buildings location of utility lines and pipes above and below ground soil analysis structure type fertility and ph historic importance of the site directional orientation established circulation patterns proximity to roads public transportation or waterways views from the site pleasant and unpleasant views toward the site problem areas such as wet spots low spots wells prevailing wind direction and velocity most of this information can be gathered by the designer although some may require the assistance of other agencies and professionals for example a complicated terrain may require that an engineering firm be hired to produce a detailed survey many designers use a checklist to summarize the characteristics of each site figure 94 once the needs of the client and the capabilities of the site are determined the two must be coordinated by the designer in doing so it is helpful to apply knowledge and experience gained from interior design known as the outdoor room concept the approach is based on two notions 1 people live in different rooms of their home and can be expected to do the same in different spaces of the landscape 2 the components of an indoor room walls ceiling and floor are also present in the outdoors thereby permitting outdoor spaces to be perceived as rooms use areas the average home is divided into four areas each having a different function 1 is where guests are received it includes the front the public area door and entrance hall in larger homes it may also include a reception room 2 is where most of the daily family interaction the general living area occurs and where friends are entertained it includes the living room dining room and family or game room 3 is where the utilitarian functions of the family are the service area carried out it includes the laundry room sewing room workshop and kitchen 5 is used for personal aspects of family life the private living area it includes the bathrooms bedrooms and dressing room figure 95 similarly the average american residential landscape has three or four different areas to accommodate different uses 1 the public area is between the house and the street it is the area everyone crosses to approach the house the public area serves two major functions to direct traffic to the entrance of the home and to place the house in an attractive setting when viewed from the street 2 is usually at the rear of the house and often the family living area to the sides as well it is the area where games are played where the patio and pool may be found where friends are entertained and barbecues held and where the family members relax 3 contains the trash and garbage cans utility sheds the service area for storage of garden tools compost piles vegetable gardens clotheslines and similar items it is always screened from view 4 is not found in all landscapes where it the private living area does occur it is the site for activities such as quiet conversation sun bathing and hot tubs it is usually limited to the use of family members 6 for the outdoor use areas to function most effectively they must be properly oriented to the sun and must adjoin their interior counterparts directly the public area is at the front of the property and should be just large enough to serve its purpose figure 96 the ideal family living area is at the rear of the house has a southern exposure to maximize its use and adjoins the living room family room andor dining room of the house the service area should be near the kitchen or a utility room so that trash garbage and laundry can be moved conveniently the area should also be close to the point of municipal trash pickup so that heavy containers do not have to be carried far the private living area is usually a morning use area it should be oriented to the east or south to catch the morning sunshine also it must have a direct linkage with the bedrooms of the house its purpose as a private area will be lost if users have to pass through other areas of the house and landscape to reach it the walls ceilings and floors of a landscape interior rooms are defined by their walls ceilings and floors in like manner outdoor spaces can be interpreted as having walls ceilings and floors the functions and materials of these components of the outdoor room are shown in table 91 materials should be selected for the outdoor room with an idea of the function they will serve and the way they will fit in with the others being used improper design decisions can often be avoided by application of the outdoor room concept for example shrubs will not be planted in the middle of a lawn if the action is compared to placing a piece of wall in the center of the room instead of at the edge where walls are meant to be the suitability of certain materials will become clearer as their functions are more precisely defined for example is the wall material to block a view frame a view divert the wind dilute the wind separate areas but not block the view or offer security is the ceiling to offer full or partial shade block a view from above create an intimate or a lofty effect offer protection from rainfall or merely to suggest the upper limits of the room is the floor to support vehicle traffic pedestrians pets or no traffic will it be next to an exit or in areas of less traffic will it be subject to staining heat or ice and snow other questions will need to be answered as the design progresses what colors or textures are important to match or complement as the outdoor room materials are selected how available are the desired materials and at what price how immediate is the effect to be how much maintenance is required and how much is the client prepared to do,effective landscape design requires an understanding of both client needs and site characteristics key client considerations include family composition hobbies outdoor entertainment preferences attitudes toward privacy and maintenance pets service needs and any special requirements such as for children or elderly residents simultaneously designers must assess the sites dimensions topography existing vegetation soil quality and drainage patterns the outdoor room concept parallels interior design treating outdoor spaces as functional rooms a typical residential landscape includes several areas public area the front space that connects the house to the street serving both aesthetic and navigational purposes family living area typically at the back designed for recreation and social gatherings service area concealed spaces for utilities and storage like garbage cans and tool sheds private living area optional spaces for intimate family activities ideally linked to bedrooms these areas must be oriented to maximize sun exposure and connected to their indoor counterparts proper material selection ensures functionality and aesthetic harmony allowing outdoor spaces to serve their intended purposes effectively
the principles of design the creation of usable imaginative landscapes depends on how skillfully the designer applies the basic principles that guide all creative planning simplicity simplicity in the landscape can be either visual or physical and is usually both simplicity usually dictates that separate elements be given less emphasis than massed elements fussy bedlines be replaced with gentle curves or straight lines and maintenancefree materials be used by massing plant species into groups attention is not diverted to each individual plant figure 910 in a similar fashion the massing of colors is preferable to a saltandpepper mixture simplicity results when pools patios walks and other constructions avoid complex shapes or forms that conflict with the overall shape of the outdoor room rhythm and line rhythm and line bring a feeling of continuity to the landscape as bedlines flow between different use areas the viewers eye should follow them comfortably without meeting jarring changes by repeating the basic layout lines colors and materials throughout the landscape the principle of rhythm and line is applied balance balance is another visual quality of the landscapes design in theory it puts the landscape on a seesaw and requires that each side have the same visual weight there are three types of balance figure 911 1 in which one side of the landscape is an exact dupli symmetrical cate mirror image of the other 2 in which one side of the landscape has the same asymmetrical visual mass as the other but does not duplicate it 3 in which the onsite landscape is developed to proximaldistal counterbalance the offsite landscape balance cannot be developed from only one or two points within the landscape it must exist from every important vantage point off the site and within it for example when viewed from across the street the public area of a residence should frame the building with the house as the center of attention as the viewer gets closer the entry door must be balanced with foundation plantings that warrant equal attention on both sides then as the viewer stands at the door and looks back toward the street the offsite view must balance against the onsite landscape focalization of interest in the application of this principle a landscape designer either creates focal points for the landscape or enhances them where they already exist each major use area of a landscape should have one focal point only where the use areas are further subdivided for example a pool area within the larger family living area should additional focal points be considered some focal points are obvious for example in the public area the house entrance is the point to which the viewers eye should be directed figure 912 examples of focal points commonly used in other areas are specimen plants statuary ponds or pools birdbaths and sundials proportion the principle of proportion should guide the size relationships between elements of the landscape figures 913 and 914 the designer must envision a mature landscape with comfortable nonthreatening size relationships between plants and buildings plants and other plants plants and people occasionally a landscape is larger than human scale and we are comfortable in the setting as when we picnic in a large park beneath a canopy of towering forest trees but in general the landscape should be designed to be in proportion with the people who will use it and the dwellings they build within it unity the master principle that gives cohesiveness to the landscape design is unity if applied properly the various use areas of the landscape will convey a sense of being pieces of the whole by maintaining consistency in the choice of the landscape components such as plants pavings fixtures or colors throughout the landscape the designer creates unity selecting plants for landscapes many influences guide the choice of plants for use in landscapes too often personal preference sentimentality or an unfamiliarity with plants prevail over more logical reasons for selection the best reasons for selecting one species of plant over another are that the plant fills the role assigned it in the design it will survive the growing conditions of the site it is affordable by the client if several species meet these specifications then personal preference and sentimentality can be applied unabashedly plants are selected for certain roles based on architectural engineering and aesthetic considerations for example when plants are used to shape the outdoor room frame a view shade a patio or soften a brick wall their function is architectural when they solve a problem such as directing traffic reducing wind velocity or absorbing dust and noise they are engineering elements if valued essentially for their appeal to the senses through fragrance sound color or other visual attributes they are aesthetic contributors when comparing plant species landscape designers look at characteristics that include the following hardiness ability to survive the winter mature size height and width flowering qualities blossom color and fragrance fruiting qualities color edibility or toxicity foliage and bark color foliage and bark texture rooting system effective or ineffective in erosion control moisture tolerance drought resistance foliage silhouette figures 915 and 916 deciduous or evergreen foliage presence or absence of thorns brittleness of the wood rate of growth and length of life ability to attract wildlife soil preferences nutrients composition and ph susceptibility to pests frequency of pruning required availability cost the relationship between rate of plant growth and brittleness of the wood is worth noting in general rapidly growing trees have more brittle wood that is why silver maples cottonwoods and willows drop branches all over the yard after a windstorm they grow quickly and break up easily it also explains the greater strength of slower growing trees like the oaks,effective landscape design relies on fundamental principles that enhance usability and creativity simplicity achieved through visual and physical clarity simplicity emphasizes massed elements over individual ones favoring gentle curves and maintenancefree materials to create a cohesive appearance rhythm and line this principle ensures continuity by allowing the viewers eye to flow comfortably through the landscape using repeating lines colors and materials balance visual equilibrium can be symmetrical mirror images or asymmetrical different yet visually equal ensuring that all vantage points maintain a harmonious look focalization of interest designers create or enhance focal points in major use areas to draw attention such as entrances specimen plants or water features proportion relationships between plants buildings and people should feel comfortable and nonthreatening guiding size selection unity the master principle unity ensures all components work together cohesively through consistent use of plants materials and colors selecting plants for landscapes the choice of plants should be based on their role adaptability to site conditions and client affordability factors like hardiness size aesthetics and maintenance requirements are crucial in plant selection
designing plantings for landscapes while no two properties are exactly alike some methods of grouping plants are common to most residential designs corner plantings defining the corners of the outdoor room are the corner plantings depending on how much privacy is desired the corner plantings may or may not be connected to the line plantings that make up the walls of the outdoor room a corner planting has two parts the incurve and the outcurves figure 917 the incurve is the most desirable location for an attractive specimen plant because it is a natural focal point the plants in the outcurves should be selected and placed to direct attention even more strongly to the incurve figure 918 the incurve plant is usually the tallest plant in the bed if the corner planting is not the major focal point of the outdoor room an accent rather than a specimen plant can be selected for the incurve an accent plant will attract the eye more than the outcurve plants but not as much as the focal point many variations are possible with a corner planting figure 919 shorter plants can be placed in front of taller plants and a statue or bench can be used instead of a plant at the incurve whatever is done it is important to keep the design simple only three or four species should be used unless the bed is exceptionally large line plantings line planting is the basic method of forming outdoor walls with plants depending on the species and their arrangement a line planting can accomplish many purposes it can provide full partial or no privacy it can also modify the climate block or frame a view and serve as a backdrop for flowers figure 920 like a corner planting a line planting should be in a cultivated bed to separate it from the lawn and provide for mulching and easier main tenance the height and width of the planting will depend on the size and number of plants used as plants are chosen the designer must know their mature size and space them far enough apart so that they can grow to maturity otherwise they will have to be pruned frequently to prevent crowding skillful design of a line planting requires practice and experience if too few species are used the planting is monotonous if too many species are used chaos results figure 921 interest can be created even with a limited number of species by grouping them into masses and staggering their placement to enhance depth perception by the viewer figure 922 for example placing lower shrubs in front of taller ones creates a stepped effect figure 923 foundation plantings houses built during the early years of the last century usually had foundations of stone or concrete blocks the foundation planting was developed in an attempt to hide this unsightly base modern houses frequently do not have exposed foundations nevertheless the belief persists among many homeowners that a foundation planting in its 1940s form is still the measure of a properly landscaped home figure 924 characteristic of that dated style were rigid upright forms accenting the corners and entrance with spreading forms in between in contrast the modern foundation planting figures 925 and 926 uses softer less geometric plant forms combines deciduous and evergreen species for greater seasonal change and interest reaches outward and forward to tie the house more intimately with the rest of the garden accents the house rather than presenting a solid mass of plant materials focuses attention on the entrance by the use of flowers and other eyeattracting features enrichment items when the indoor room has been constructed the final step is to add those things that make it usable and personal furniture pictures a stereo and lamps are just a few of the things needed to complete an indoor room additions are also needed for an outdoor room they are termed enrichment items these are elements of the landscape that do not function primarily as wall ceiling or floor figures 927 through 930 but serve some other essential purpose outdoor enrichment items may be classified as natural or manmade in origin and as tangible or intangible in character table 97 there are two pitfalls in the use of landscape enrichment items one is that the quality of the items selected may not match the quality of the overall landscape the other is that the items may be used to excess to avoid the overuse of enrichment items a good test is to remove an item then stand back and decide if it is missed if the design does not suffer by its absence it probably was not needed determining the quality or worth of an enrichment item is more difficult because it is so subjective in general the types of outdoor furniture usually sold at local discount centers such as aluminum frame lawn chairs with plastic webbing are too gaudy to fit tastefully into a welldesigned outdoor room as for gazing globes pink flamingos plaster ducks and impish gnomes they are better suited to carnivals than landscapes much of what is available in garden statuary is mass production of sculpture created for 16th and 17thcentury gardens as such it is anachronistic in most modern gardens whenever possible invest a bit more money for enrichment items that are more natural or original even without much money a good designer can incorporate many tangible and intangible natural enrichment items into the landscape thoughtful selection of plant species can attract interesting wildlife to the garden pleasant fragrances are also merely a matter of selecting the proper plants,effective landscape design incorporates various methods for grouping plants enhancing both aesthetic appeal and functionality corner plantings these define outdoor room corners and include two components the incurve where a focal or accent plant is placed and the outcurves which direct attention to the incurve its crucial to keep designs simple typically using three or four species line plantings serving as outdoor walls line plantings can offer privacy modify climate or frame views these should be cultivated beds ensuring proper spacing for plant maturity to avoid frequent pruning a balanced use of species creates visual interest with staggered placements for depth foundation plantings originally designed to conceal foundations modern approaches favor softer forms that incorporate both deciduous and evergreen species these plantings should accentuate the home drawing focus to entrances and integrating with the surrounding garden enrichment items to personalize outdoor spaces enrichment itemsboth natural and manmadeare added care should be taken to match their quality with the landscapes overall design excessive use can detract from the space thus items should be thoughtfully selected to enhance rather than overwhelm
selecting construction materials comparable in importance to the selection of plants is the choice of nonplant construction materials for the outdoor room essential for architectural and engineering functions the construction materials available are nearly as diverse as the plant materials that a designer must choose from a good designer must know the characteristics potential uses and availability of various woods and pavings of materials that may be precast quarried or prefabricated landscape designers can also benefit from the personal experience of working with construction materials in order to understand the difficulties encountered when they are specified for particular uses several excellent construction specification manuals are available for reference these are updated regularly to keep professional designers abreast of current materials their dimensions strength potentials and costs the following comparison of some common construction materials will serve as a simplified introduction to a complex subject enclosure materials enclosure materials form walls for the outdoor room as such they function in many ways like the walls of indoor rooms in addition they often do things that indoor walls do not do the particular enclosure material selected will depend on whether the purpose is to offer as with a security fence or a retaining wall strength requiring a height of at least 6 feet and the properties of privacy solidity and nontransparency which may necessitate the strength to withstand and climate control divert strong winds or high snowdrifts which may require height and screening or space articulation nothing more than a suggestion of the rooms limits permitting attractive offsite features to be seen much of the enclosure material available today is prefabricated it may also be constructed onsite using materials such as wood or stone poured or precast concrete brick or railroad ties figure 931 compares commonly used landscape enclosure materials and several representative styles surfacing materials surfacing materials form floors for the outdoor room while topquality turfgrass would be the first choice of most people as the most attractive and comfortable surfacing it will not withstand concentrated foot traffic and tolerates very little vehicular traffic groundcover and flowers are also attractive surfacings but their use is aesthetic they will tolerate no traffic of any type therefore the need for constructed surfacings is firmly established in the landscape industry depending on their degree of durability and their physical structure constructed surfacings are categorized as either hard pavings or soft pavings the terms have little to do with the comfort of walking on them hard pavings are either poured or set into place as modular units and become solid when installation is completed examples include decking poured concrete precast concrete slabs brick cobblestone flagstone and an everexpanding selection of precast interlocking units that permit the creation of highly decorative patterned pavings soft pavings are loose aggregate materials sometimes finely particulate like sand sometimes coarsely particulate like crushed stone or brick chips they may be hard and virtually indestructible or may shatter pulverize and even decay examples include sand crushed stone brick chips marble chips stone dust wood chips tan bark sawdust and asphalt all are temporary either because of deterioration or because they are easily carried away on shoes and tires they may be dusty when the weather is dry sticky in the case of asphalt and tracked into the house if used near doorways soft pavings are seldom satisfactory as surfacings for areas that receive intensive use such as patios or entrance walks however they are well suited to areas where grass is impractical yet the expense of hard surfacing is unwarranted such as secondary walks dog yards service areas and childrens play areas table 98 compares commonly used landscape surfacing materials materials and methods a landscape design begins as an idea in the mind of a landscape architect or designer as the needs of the client are matched with the capabilities and limitations of the site new needs may be generated as the client more fully understands the propertys potential eventually the abstract ideas in the designers mind must be given a form that will permit subsequent ideas to be related to the earlier ones still later the more developed proposals of the designer must be presented in a form that the client can understand finally assuming acceptance by the client the designers plan must be read by the landscape contractor who will implement the design the landscape designer must convey his or her ideas to a client in a way that helps the client envision how the finished landscape will appear and function while the design is still only a drawing many clients find this difficult since they are unaccustomed to reading flat drawings often the drawings must be interpreted by clients and others when the designer is not available to answer questions as they arise on even more rare occasions a design may be reviewed by a client who does not speak the same language as the designer in any of these situations the drawing must speak for itself and speak in a language that makes the design understandable to the viewer that language is graphics as applied to landscape plans graphics are a combination of style and technique in a manner suggestive of spoken languages graphics evolve over time overlaying traditional tools and styles with new technology the tools for the majority of the years that landscape designers have been interpreting their ideas on paper they have used the traditional instrumentation of the draftsman using tsquare triangles pencils measuring tools and assorted templates landscape designers and architects have created plans for planting arrangements hardscape items lighting effects water features views and vistas for projects as small as a backyard or as grandiose as a palace garden figure 932 illustrates many of the tools that are used to create landscape plans in the traditional manner many landscape designers still use traditional methods to prepare their drawings some because they prefer the personalization that only a drawing done completely by hand can display others because they design infrequently and find the traditional instrumentation to be all that is necessary in recent years computer technology has developed that enables designers to prepare their plans on a monitor screen before printing it out in paper form computer aided design cad systems are commonly used by landscape designers and architects to create designs for all types of projects while the early cad graphics were simplistic bordering on cartoonish there are now a number of software programs that have graphic capability that can match the best hand drawn plans cad systems also have one additional and major advantage over hand drawn plans the speed with which changes can be made they have the disadvantages of being expensive and necessitating training before use however both costs and complexity are moderating and will likely continue to do so making cad designing the standard technology for even small companies in the very near future the instruments of the designer who works on the computer supplement those of the traditional draftsman a digital camera andor a video camera are used to capture and record site data a scanner may be used to transfer images and data from the photographs or other sources the images captured by the cameras and scanners can be used to produce base maps and to produce illustrations of the installed design to aid the clients visualization of the proposal the software programs in use today range from those that are comprehensive of every design detail in the most complex project to those that are best suited for the simpler uses of a homeowner autocad a registered trademark of autodesk inc comprehensive system for the professional user it requires specialized hardware software and user training landcadd comprehensive system currently marketed by eagle point software that offers needspecific modules in site planning and design irrigation design cut and fill calculations drainage calculations plant selection road alignment cost estimating and others autosketch an inexpensive program that allows the designer to draw in a range of styles from conceptual to highly refined it is a good program for creating technical drawings at low cost sketchup permits a design concept to be viewed as a 3d model the degree of realism can be controlled by the user depending on the level of completeness and sophistication warranted by the drawing plantare a program developed in europe that contains three separate modules one for developing base maps one for creating planting plans and one for the selection of specific plants pro landscape a software package that performs multiple functions complete plan view designing photoimaging and preparation of the project proposal dynascape an even more comprehensive package in addition to features described above it gives the designer the ability to provide clients with complete plant care information generate a material quantity estimate provide color images of the plants specified in the design prepare a bid and offer business management tools design imaging a program that permits a designer to superimpose a design proposal onto a photo image of a building or other site feature the result looks like a photo of the installed landscape drawing surfaces a variety of drawing surfaces is used by landscape design professionals some have a short life others must be stronger because the drawings are meant to be permanent or must endure repeated handling and folding some of the surfaces are for original drawings whereas others are for copies some are best suited to pencil others are more suitable for ink felt pen colored pencils or other media a brief summary of the drawing surfaces and their uses follows drawing paper a heavy opaque surface it is used for sketching and for oneofakind drawings it takes pen and pencil equally well markers are likely to bleed and run on it the smoother finishes are less absorbent vellum translucent paper surface vellum is manufactured in several weights and qualities vellum is a surface on which drawings are originated or traced the most lightweight vellum has a limited life it is used for firstdraft drawings and sketches heavier grades are used to trace designs that are to be presented to the client or contractors because it is translucent vellum can be copied in a diazo duplicator which is one of the most common ways to reproduce drawings in quantities mylar film a translucent plastic surface it is used like heavyweight vellum to make final tracings for presentation and duplication mylar film is more expensive than vellum it is frosted on one or both sides necessary for ink or graphite to adhere to the surface drafting cloth a translucent surface of plastic with a thin layer of linen bonded to it the cloth side is the one drawn on drafting cloth is the most expensive drafting surface it is used where strength is important reproductive paper film and cloth sensitized materials that permit positive duplication of drawings done in pencil or ink on vellum film or cloth use of the paper requires a copying machine like the diazo duplicator specialeffect papers are available as well types of landscape drawings while there are many types of mechanical drawings and ways to illustrate objects the landscape designer most frequently utilizes the plan view the plan view assumes a vantage point directly above the proposed landscape looking down perpendicular to the ground figure 933,selecting construction materials is crucial in landscape design serving essential architectural and engineering functions alongside plant choices enclosure materials form the walls of outdoor spaces providing security privacy or climate control options include wood stone concrete and brick chosen based on the specific requirements of height and strength surfacing materials create the floors of outdoor rooms while natural turfgrass is attractive it cannot withstand heavy foot traffic thus constructed surfacings are necessary categorized as hard pavings eg concrete brick flagstone and soft pavings eg sand crushed stone with the latter being temporary and less durable the landscape design process evolves from an initial idea to detailed plans that clients and contractors can understand designers utilize traditional drafting tools alongside computeraided design cad technology for efficient and precise creation of designs various drawing surfaces such as drawing paper vellum mylar film and drafting cloth are used based on the drawings purpose and permanence the plan view is the most common type of landscape drawing providing a topdown perspective
installing landscape plants the importance of proper installation highquality landscapes begin with topquality plant materials both depend on careful installation techniques to ensure the survival and growth of the transplanted stock landscape contractors joke about 25 dollar plants set into 75 dollar holes in fact a great deal of labor and materials are often needed to prepare a hostile planting site for a new plant few sites offer a perfect combination of proper soil texture fertility and ph with correct drainage optimum water and humidity throughout the posttransplant period all are necessary for successful transplanting the necessary tools since the plant material to be installed includes seeds bulbs bedding plants groundcovers and trees and shrubs of all sizes a wide range of tools must be available to accomplish the installation the hand tools most commonly used are shown and described in figure 101 as plant materials increase in size hand tools must be supplemented with power tools the tree spade makes possible the successful transplant of large trees and shrubs figure 102 it operates on a hydraulic system with each movement controlled from a set of levers that permits the machine to be operated by anyone regardless of physical strength other power tools helpful in the installation of landscape plants include the power auger power tiller tractor frontend loader back hoe trencher and the treeporter the latter like the tree spade is used to transplant large trees the machine drives individual steel blades into the soil around the tree to be moved the blades are like steel sheets and cut through the root system when all four blades are in place the root system has been encased in a soil cube the blades are then locked together and the tree lifted with a hoist for movement to a new location root forms of landscape plants landscape plants are available in a variety of root forms bedding plants and groundcovers are usually grown in pressed peat pots or plastic packets that permit the root system to be transplanted intact trees and shrubs can be purchased as barerooted balledandburlapped b b or containerized plants the advantages and disadvantages of each are compared in figure 103 which root form is best to use depends on the season of the year the availability of stock the size of the plants at the time of installation and the budget of the project bare root is a common root form for deciduous shrubs and a few trees that develop new roots quickly after transplanting evergreens are most often balledandburlapped or containerized deciduous trees and shrubs may also be obtained in b b or containerized forms large b b plants may have the soil ball reinforced with a wire basket to prevent breakage during handling vines are usually containerized the time to transplant the best season for transplanting depends on the type of material being planted usually the prime objective is to transplant at a time that will permit good root growth before shoots and leaves develop for most plants in most parts of the country that time is early autumn then the roots can grow as long as the soil remains unfrozen and the cool air temperatures encourage the aboveground parts to go dormant early spring when root growth exceeds shoot growth is the second best season summer is not a good season unless containerized material is used with its intact root system winter is not a good season for transplanting in northern regions because the roots cannot grow in regions where the winter temperatures are milder and the ground does not freeze winter can be a satisfactory alternate season for transplanting flowering bulbs have definite transplant seasons hardy bulbs which bloom in the spring must be planted in the fall tender bulbs which flower in the summer and will not survive the winter are planted in the spring dug up in the fall and stored indoors over winter annual flowers purchased as bedding plants are transplanted in the spring after all danger of frost is past methods of installation the one consideration common to all methods of landscape plant installation is how to minimize transplant shock stress and return the plant to a normal state of growth as quickly as possible in addressing that common consideration the methods of installation vary greatly a shallow rooted bedding plant propagated in the artificial soil of a greenhouse and expected to live no longer than ninety days at its transplant site will not require the same method of transplanting as a medium size tree that was grown undisturbed in a nursery field and is expected to grow and flourish for many more years in a new location stress is the principal consideration that must be addressed and overcome it can be both physical and physiological for example if a young tree is whipped by the wind it may become physically injured at its base as the young trunk is bent back and forth while the root ball remains unmoved physiological stress can occur if the plant cannot take up enough water after transplanting to prevent its wilting stress can also result from hypersensitivity to the light or temperature of the new location the keys to reduction of stress and transplant shock are preparation of a proper planting site preparation of the root system at the time of installation proper placement and postplacement handling correct backfilling adequate watering and mulching protection and stabilization of the transplant timely followup care of the transplant the planting site flowers groundcovers and bulbs usually are placed into a cultivated bed rather than in individual holes this permits them to be installed with a hand trowel hoe or bulb planter rather than with a spade preparation of the planting site may be done using a spading fork shovel or a garden tiller except in areas where the water table is high or the drainage very poor adequate drainage for successful establishment of flowers and groundcovers can be attained by incorporating quantities of sand and organic matter into the soil at the time of bed preparation trees and shrubs require differing site preparations depending on their size and the form of their root systems much has been discovered by horticulture researchers in recent years that is contrary to long established industry practices the objective of the landscaper should be to make the planting hole the correct size to meet the needs of the plant as measured by its root form and the soil structure at the planting site on sites where the soil structure is good and drainage adequate the planting hole should be just deep enough to contain the root system allowing it to rest on undisturbed soil with the top of the root ball two or more inches above the top edge of the planting hole where drainage is poor the root ball should be set even higher figure 104 for bare root plants the hole should be deep enough to contain the root system without it becoming wadded in all cases the plants are set high to allow for settling that will usually occur over time after several waterings it also helps prevent water from collecting around the trunk and promoting disease the width of the planting hole will also vary from site to site for bare root plants the width need be only enough to prevent crowding for balled and burlapped and containerized plants the planting hole should be at least twice as wide as the soil ball the same applies to the width of trenches used for hedge plantings on sites where the soil is highly compacted such as former building sites the width of the planting hole should be increased to three or more times the diameter of the soil ball all soils especially those that are compacted or have a high clay content are likely to become glazed along the sides of a planting hole glazing can prevent the roots from growing into the surrounding soil when the hole is created mechanically as with an auger or a tree spade the probability of glazing is even greater therefore the sides and bottom of the planting hole should be loosened scarified before the plant is set scarification can be done with a spade hoe or steel rake preparing the root system bedding plants and groundcovers need little preparation prior to transplanting due to their method of propagation if contained in peat pots the plants can be set directly into the prepared soil those grown in plastic or clay production containers should have them removed before planting if the root system has become pot bound wadded and growing around themselves the root mass should be squeezed gently to break it apart and the roots pulled downward before planting figure 105 for bare root and containerized shrubs and trees an inspection of the root system should precede planting any matted or encircling roots should be straightened all damaged dead or otherwise unhealthy roots should be pruned back to healthy tissue containerized plants may benefit by having their root ball cut at intervals all around to encourage new growth that will be properly oriented the cuts should be on the bottom half of the root mass figure 106 another technique used to overcome the girdling tendency of some containerized plants is butterflying it requires the soil ball to be split half way up its center so that the root system can be spread apart like butterfly wings when placed into the planting hole if the potentially irdling roots are in the top half of the soil ball butterflying will not help however where applicable the technique can promote a more natural root orientation in the new transplant,the successful installation of landscape plants is vital for their longterm survival and growth relying on quality materials and meticulous techniques a range of tools is needed for this process from hand tools for small plants to power equipment like tree spades and augers for larger specimens landscape plants are available in several root forms including bareroot balledandburlapped b b and containerized with each form having specific advantages depending on plant type and environmental conditions timing is crucial for transplanting early autumn is generally the best season for most plants allowing root growth before winter dormancy while summer is suitable only for containerized plants with intact root systems minimizing transplant shockstress caused by transplantingis essential for plant health key strategies include preparing the planting site to ensure adequate drainage and soil structure properly managing the root system before planting such as straightening or pruning unhealthy roots correctly watering and mulching after installation following up with timely care to support establishment the planting hole should accommodate the plants root form ensuring appropriate depth and width to facilitate healthy growth and prevent disease
placement and related care placing the plant into the planting hole is easy if the plant is lightweight it becomes more difficult as the size of the plant and the weight of the root ball increase the labor and related costs can range from minimal to highly significant bare root plants can be lifted without damage by grasping them along their branches or trunk plants with soil balls can be damaged if lifted at a point that allows the weight of the root ball to place stress on the crown where the branches or trunk join the root system they should be lifted by grasping them at the crown not higher up if the plants are to be carried any distance the soil ball should be supported by hand ball cart or machine figure 107 before the soil ball is set into the planting pit the root flare of the plant should be located the root flare is the place where the first set of large lateral roots is attached to the tree or shrub in most tree species it is what causes the trunk of the plant to taper outward the root flare is responsible for the stability of the tree or shrub and needs to be at grade level if a plant is set too deep causing the root flare to be buried the plant can suffocate from too little oxygen reaching the roots some plants will develop a set of secondary roots in the soil above the buried root flare in time these roots will girdle and kill the plant it is not uncommon for the root flare to become buried beneath several inches of soil or mulch in both b b and containerized plants this can create a false impression of the correct level for transplanting after being placed into the planting hole and positioned for the best display soil balls need to be stabilized at their base to prevent tipping to the side later there is a predictable temptation for laborers to twist and turn the plants by lifting them by the branches as much as possible the plants should be positioned and adjusted by turning the ball plants that have their soil balls wrapped in burlap should have the burlap untied or unpinned at the top and the top half of the wrapping cut away while some texts recommend tucking the loose burlap down into the hole it is preferable to cut it away large folds of burlap can interfere with proper root development it is seldom necessary to remove the lower half of the burlap wrapping unless the burlap is made of nonbiodegradable material it is most important that no burlap be exposed to the air after backfilling allowing that would promote rapid water loss through wicking if the burlapped soil ball has been placed within a wire basket it will undoubtedly be a heavy plant and difficult to maneuver orientation of the plant should be studied and planned before placement in the hole since there is little opportunity to move it once it is set after setting the plant the wire basket needs to be cut away from the top of the ball ideally the entire basket should be removed but risking the breakage of the soil ball while wrestling away the wire is not recommended in most field studies allowing a portion of the wire basket to remain around the soil ball has not retarded establishment and normal development of the transplant correct backfilling backfill is the soil returned to the planting hole after the plant is set the soil interface is the place where the backfill meets both the soil ball and the sides of the planting hole if the backfill soil is significantly differ ent from either the soil ball or the surrounding soil in texture moisture content aeration or added amendments the transplant may be negatively affected for example if the backfill is amended to become finer textured than the soil in the root ball it creates an underground sponge that quickly pulls water away from the root ball and holds it where the plant cannot reach it if the backfill is more conducive for root growth than the surrounding soil many root systems will not develop properly they will stay within the planting hole and not spread wide and deep as they should therefore for most planting situations the backfilling should either be done using the soil removed from the hole or with a soil that closely matches the original soil in texture and other attributes as backfill is added care should be taken to avoid leaving air pockets within the planting hole bare root plants should have soil worked under and into the root mass to eliminate air space the persons doing the installation should use their feet to tamp down the soil around the soil ball of b b and container grown materials just enough pressure should be applied to eliminate air pockets while avoiding compacting the backfill watering and mulching annuals and groundcovers should be watered while still in their production containers and just prior to transplanting after installation is complete the entire planting bed should be thoroughly watered the new planting should be carefully monitored in the days that follow to ensure that the plants get adequate moisture to prevent wilting and encourage deep root growth watering should occur early enough in the day to permit complete drying of the foliage before temperatures cool possibly providing an opportune environment for disease development trees and shrubs may receive some water as the backfill is added for large soil balls that is especially important regardless of the size all trees and shrubs will need water as soon as possible after the transplanting is completed the water will promote settling of the backfill which may necessitate either additional backfill or the slight lifting of the plant to return it to the proper planting depth the latter is common with bare root forms of plants otherwise the plant may sink and not establish successfully before applying the water a bermed ring of soil should be built around the plant using excess backfill it should be compacted enough to retain water and it should be several inches in height the berm should be built directly over the soil ball and closely approximate the diameter of the soil ball it should not overshoot the soil ball since the intent is to ensure that water applied within the berm permeates the soil ball rather than flowing around it into the looser backfill it may be necessary to fill the basin several times in order to ensure a suitable level of soil moisture for the new transplant after watering mulching is recommended for trees and shrubs in all but poorly drained locations mulching is the application of loose aggregate materials to the surface of the planting bed or backfilled planting pit the materials may be organic or inorganic examples of both types and their advantages and disadvantages are listed in table 101 to be effective in moisture retention and weed control the mulch must be applied three to four inches deep a shallow layer of mulch has only cosmetic value it does not reduce sunlight enough to discourage weed seed germination and growth nor does it retain moisture or insulate the soil surface against temperature fluctuations mulch should fill the ringed berm around the new transplant but not be in contact with the trunk or crown it is especially important that the mulch not bury the root flare too much moisture at the base of the plant can promote disease development or insect injury figure 108 illustrates the key points in tree and shrub installation,proper placement and care during the installation of landscape plants are critical for their successful establishment the process begins with lifting the plant correctly to avoid damaging the root ball or crown the root flare where large lateral roots connect to the trunk must be positioned at grade level to ensure adequate oxygen supply burying it can lead to suffocation or girdling roots after placing the plant it should be stabilized to prevent tipping burlap should be untied or cut away at the top ensuring that no material is exposed to air postbackfilling to avoid moisture loss backfilling involves returning soil to the planting hole with a focus on matching the texture and moisture of the surrounding soil to prevent water retention issues watering is essential immediately after planting to promote settling and encourage deep root growth a berm of soil should be created around the plant to retain moisture additionally mulching helps conserve moisture and suppress weeds with a recommended depth of three to four inches ensuring it does not touch the trunk or cover the root flare to prevent disease
protecting and stabilizing once installed some trees or shrubs may need additional safeguards to counter the effects of the sun prevailing winds maintenance workers vandals or animals trunk wraps various methods of staking and guying and antitranspirants are materials used to protect and stabilize new transplants trunk wraps to protect young tree species that have thin bark and are at risk for injury by extremely hot summer temperatures or drying winds it has been common practice to wrap the trunks from the ground up to the first set of branches with a protective covering rolls of commercial tree wrap are available as burlap stripping or as a crepelike paper except in arid regions the wraps are applied from the base of the tree upward with each coil overlapping the one below to prevent moisture from getting in the trunk wrap is tied at the top using another strip of burlap or twine but not wire despite its long standing acceptance by landscapers and arborists as a proper protective technique trunk wrapping has garnered only mixed support among researchers some studies seem to justify its value others find no significant benefit it may be that the value is specific to certain species of certain ages and planted into certain locations subject to certain environmental conditions one thing is definite all trunk wrap must be biodegradable even the twine the wrap and twine should either degrade naturally after two years or be removed by hand to leave it in place any longer can harm the tree for protection against animal injury the trunks may be wrapped with plastic coils like the wraps tree coils should be removed after two years figure 109 staking and guying if installed properly most trees and shrubs will not need support to grow straight and strong past practice nearly always included staking or guying transplants especially trees but that has now been proved to be unnecessary and often detrimental staking and guying have been shown to cause effects such as these in transplanted trees damage due to girdling from the tie materials bent growth away from the stake increased stress on the trunk at the point of attachment to the staking materials weak wood development from the staked support downward toward the base of the tree reduced root production reduced trunk taper the initial reason for staking and guying was to prevent the transplanted tree or large shrub from moving usually due to the wind recent research has shown that transplants actually benefit from some movement as it stimulates better root growth in general trees that are six feet or less in height or less than one inch in caliper trunk diameter measured six inches above the ground will not require staking to support them only trees that are very large or have weak trunks or are being transplanted in high wind locations should be staked or guyed additionally trees that are transplanted in densely populated urban areas where vandalism is a potential problem or where mowing is done by workers who are insensitive to the care of new plantings may find staking or guying to be necessary safeguards if it is to be done then here is how to do it staking uses one two or three wood or metal stakes driven into the ground parallel to the trunk of a tree and down into solid undisturbed soil the stakes should be long enough to extend about 8 inches above their point of attachment to the tree the point of attachment should be about 6 inches above the highest point at which the trunk can be bent by a strong wind yet return to its upright position the stakes can be attached to the tree in several ways the traditional way has used heavy wire looped through links of hose at the point of contact with the tree then attached to the stakes and tightened by twisting the wire at its center until the desired tautness is attained although still used the wire and hose link technique has been shown to cause injury to some plants when repeated movement by the wind causes the hose coverings to wear away the bark that may result in a girdling condition currently gaining favor and acceptance are commercial ties that replace the wire and hose links made of tough weather resistant webbing the ties are flat and wider than wire so they do not gouge the bark they also have a slight elasticity providing a more flexible support to the plant than the wire and hose technique since the webbing material cannot be twisted like wire it should be applied with a figureeight loop between the stake and the tree to allow for flexibility using a single stake is most appropriate when the intent is to prevent a plant from being pushed off center by a strong prevailing wind in such a case the stake is positioned on the upwind side of the plant for the stabilization of small trees two stakes are often used figure 1011a they are placed on opposite sides of the trunk and attached to the same point on the tree securing the trunk at additional levels along the stakes should be avoided because it creates additional stress points when the tree moves in the wind however the two stakes can be reinforced at the base with a wooden cross tie to prevent their wobbling and coming loose on windy sites three stakes may be used for added stability three stakes also offer greater protection from mower damage and may dissuade vandals guying is the stabilization of large trees and multistemmed plants using the hose wrapped wires or strapping material described above but attached to anchoring devices that are driven into the undisturbed soil if stakes are used as the anchors they should be driven at a 45degree angle to the ground surface and point toward the tree if driven to point away from the tree they can become loosened over time figure 1011b usually three guys are needed to provide the desired stability for exceptionally large trees underground anchors termed deadmen may be used to ensure that the guys do not work loose support wires can be twisted to the desired tautness or turnbuckles installed to accomplish the same thing for safety all exposed wires should be flagged with colorful tape so that no one trips over them whether a plant is staked or guyed all apparatus should be removed after one year to avoid injury and prevent girdling antitranspirants antitranspirants also called antidessicants are chemicals that reduce the amount of water plants lose through transpiration antitranspirants are useful because excessive water loss can result in transplant stress while formulations vary most products act either to induce closing of the stomata or to cover the stomata with a waterimpermeable coating several popular brand names are available the antitranspirants are sprayed onto the plants before and again after transplanting since the majority of plant stomata are present in the greatest numbers on the lower surface of leaves the underside of the canopy should receive the greatest coverage antitranspirants are of the greatest benefit in the transplanting of deciduous trees and shrubs that are in leaf they are also of benefit to evergreens especially broadleaved forms any evergreen will benefit from antitranspirants if it is transplanted in the fall right before the dry winter period followup care of the transplants to ensure the success of newly planted trees and shrubs it is important that certain things be monitored in the days and weeks that follow the monitoring may be done by the company that installed the plants or by the property owner or by both the specifics of care include pruning of branches damaged during movement and planting or the removal of selected branches from the canopy to reduce the chance of the plant being tipped by the wind keeping the plants deeply watered but not waterlogged eliminating weeds turf and other competing plants that could deprive the transplant of moisture rodent control using devices such as plastic trunk coils or screen wire to prevent animal feeding that can girdle trunks or destroy the canopy frequent checks of stakes and guys to ensure their tautness and to affirm that there is no rubbing injury at the point of attachment to the tree removal of all stakes and guys associated hardware and trunk wraps at the appropriate time reapplication of antitranspirants after leaves have expanded andor prior to the onset of winter,after planting some trees and shrubs may require additional protection and stabilization against environmental stressors like sun wind and animal activity trunk wraps are often used to safeguard young trees with thin bark from extreme temperatures and drying winds these wraps made from biodegradable materials like burlap or crepe paper should be applied from the base upward and removed after two years to prevent harm to the tree staking and guying are techniques traditionally used to keep plants upright but recent research indicates they can be detrimental leading to girdling weak growth and reduced root development staking may still be necessary for large trees in highwind areas or vulnerable locations proper staking involves attaching stakes approximately six inches above the trees highest flexible point and using flexible ties rather than wire to avoid injury antitranspirants which reduce water loss through transpiration can alleviate transplant stress they are particularly beneficial for deciduous trees and broadleaved evergreens especially when applied before and after transplanting regular followup care is essential including watering pruning monitoring for pests and ensuring that protective measures are not causing harm this proactive approach promotes the healthy establishment of new plants
installing bedding plants groundcovers and bulbs earlier descriptions explained that these special landscape plants do not have the large root balls common to trees and shrubs they are seldom planted in individually prepared holes but rather are set shallowly into prepared planting beds bedding plants and groundcovers the spacing of the plants will determine the time required to attain the effect desired predictably closer spacing will result in more rapid coverage but it will also increase the expense of both labor and mate rials table 94 in chapter 9 lists some of the most common species of groundcovers their optimum spacing and selected other characteristics to ensure even and maximum coverage bedding plants and groundcovers should be installed in a staggered planting pattern figure 1012 frequent waterings are needed to prevent the transplants from drying out and to encourage deep rooting mulching surprisingly is not always recommended coarse mulches can discourage the lateral spread of the small plants and delay or entirely prevent their filling the bed area generally mulching is not recommended for bedding plants it can be helpful with groundcovers to prevent their heaving to the surface following the alternate freezing and thawing of winter soils if used the mulch for groundcovers should be fine textured and applied after the ground has frozen not at the time of installation bulbs flowering bulbs require a rich welldrained soil they are planted either in flower beds and borders or as masses in the lawn they may be gently tossed by the handful into open turfed lawn areas to be planted wherever they land in an irregular spaced pattern bulbs are planted at differing depths and spacings depending on their species table 102 lists the depths and spacings of some common bulbs bulbs are always set into the ground with the base oriented downward and the shoot pointed upward figure 1013 many can be installed with a bulb planter other bulblike structures called tubers and rhizomes are installed in mounded holes that permit the structure to be oriented horizontally and the roots directed downward figure 1014 as always the backfilling step should be done carefully to ensure that no air pockets form water collecting around the bulbs in air pockets can promote rotting problems of arid regions the landscaper installing plants in the american southwest encounters four distinct problems 1 the soil quality is generally poor 2 irrigation is necessary throughout the year 3 higher altitudes can produce extremely hot daytime temperatures and very cool nights 4 high winds dry out plants quickly and often damage them physically arid soils generally fall into three categories pure sand or gypsum adobe and caliche sand lacks both nutrient content and humus adobe is a heavy claylike soil that holds moisture better than sand but needs humus to lighten it and improve its aeration caliche soils are highly alkaline due to excessive lime content they have a calcareous hardpan deposit near the surface that blocks drainage making plant growth impossible the hardpan layer may lie right at the surface or from several inches to several feet below ground level the deposits may occur as a granular accumulation or as an impermeable concretelike layer generally these are the characteristics of arid soils lack humus require frequent irrigation are nutritionally poor nutrients are continually leached out by the irrigation water are highly alkaline phs of 75 to 85 and higher are low in phosphate phosphate may be rendered unavailable by the high ph lack iron or contain it in a form unavailable to plants have a high soluble salt content resulting from alkaline irrigation waters and from manures and fertilizers that do not leach thoroughly when installing plants in the southwest the landscaper must add organic matter to the soils to improve their structure organic matter improves the water retention capability of light sandy soils and breaks up heavy adobe soils the only way to improve the drainage of caliche soil is to break through it and remove the impermeable layer the excavated soil can be replaced with a conditioned mix that will support healthy plant growth to catch and retain the water so vital yet so limited in arid regions the planting beds should be recessed several inches below ground level to create a catch basin figure 1015 this method traps and holds applied water preventing loss through runoff in addition organic mulches should be applied to a depth of four inches or more to slow moisture loss and create a cooler growth environment for the roots trunk wraps and whitewash paint are also applied to the trunks of trees to prevent water loss through their thin bark due to sun scald cactus plants are sufficiently different from other plants to warrant special mention they can be transplanted successfully by following these steps 1 before transplanting mark the north side of the cactus orient this side of the plant to the north in its new location the plant will have developed a thicker layer of protective tissue on its south side to withstand the more intense sunlight 2 by trenching around the cactus lift as much as possible of the root system 3 brush soil from the roots and dust them with powdered sulfur 4 place the cactus in a shaded area where air circulates freely and allow the roots to heal for a week before replanting 5 plant the cactus in dry welldrained soil stake the plant if necessary 6 water the plant in three or four weeks after new growth starts thereafter apply water at monthly intervals whenever possible native or naturalized plants should be selected for southwestern landscapes they have a better chance of surviving the transplant and they keep maintenance costs down in situations in which the soil is especially unsuitable for planting there may be little choice but to install the plants above ground in planters planting in the southeast the majority of textbooks that describe plant installation use photographs and examples common to the temperate zone this one is no exception fortunately there are not many geographic differences in methods of installation but there are a few they are based largely on plant species distinctions and on soil differences palms palms are monocots that grow as trees or shrubs and may have single or multiple trunks there are many different types of palms and they can be found in settings as diverse as the seacoast and the desert each branch has only a single terminal bud allowing the plant to grow only at that point roots are produced continuously from the base of the trunk and they are shorter lived than the roots of woody dicots the majority of palms that are used in landscapes are grown in nurseries not the wild they may be produced in containers or grown in fields like the woody dicots palms must have an adequate root and soil ball attached if they are to transplant successfully however because of the difference in how and where the roots are produced the root ball is seldom as large as that of the woody plants a root ball diameter that is about two feet greater than the diameter of the trunk is generally accepted as an adequate size to be certain landscapers should consult the local industry standards of their geographic region since there is no single industry norm many palms are not root pruned before being dug to promote new root formation prior to transplanting large palms can be moved with a tree spade smaller plants are handled with ball carts or carried at the root ball to protect the tender terminal bud the fronds of a palm are usually tied up and around the end of each branch with biodegradable twine before being harvested and moved it is important to keep the root ball moist until the transplant is accomplished figures 1016a and b palms should be set at the same depth they were in the field or in their production container if set too shallow they may topple over if set too deep they may suffer nutrient deficiency staking is often needed to stabilize the new transplants the technique used is an exterior support brace not the wire system described for temperate zone trees figure 1017 following their transplanting the palms should be kept wellwatered and misted throughout their first season where conditions are excessively hot and dry the fronds may remain tied around the terminal bud for most of the first season as well as to protect it from drying the support structure may remain in place for up to a year,installing bedding plants groundcovers and bulbs requires attention to spacing soil conditions and local climates bedding plants and groundcovers are typically planted shallowly in staggered patterns for quicker coverage needing frequent watering coarse mulches may hinder growth and are generally not recommended for bedding plants though finetextured mulch can help groundcovers during winter bulbs thrive in welldrained soil planted with the base downward and shoot upward to avoid air pockets that promote rot in arid regions landscapers face challenges like poor soil quality necessary yearround irrigation and high winds soil types such as sand adobe or caliche require organic matter to improve drainage and moisture retention recessed planting beds can help retain water and organic mulches can reduce evaporation for cacti careful transplanting techniques are crucial for their successful establishment in the southeast planting palms requires specific methods due to their monocot structure adequately sized root balls and proper planting depth are essential following transplanting palms should be wellwatered and misted throughout the first season to promote healthy growth
total quality management a new concern for an old idea the end of world war ii left the economy of the world tilted heavily in favor of the united states europe and most of asia were left with only skeletal remains of their prewar industrial capability american factories were intact and able to convert from the production of war goods to the manufacture of countless products and machines needed by the rest of the world we had no competition on the world stage as the rest of the world slowly rebuilt their industrial capabilities comparison of their products to those made in the united states was the worldwide standard quality was defined as made in america regardless of whether the business dealt in products or in services most american companies operating in the postwar era focused their quality standard on the finished product or service and defined it to fit their personal image quality control was usually the final inspection step in the manufacturing or service process and products that failed to meet the prescribed quality standard were rejected similarly services that were unsatisfactory were repeated in full or in part the customer was not involved in the definition or the measurement of quality at all complaint or approval was the customers only role yet products and services that do not meet the customers needs cannot be considered qualitative a florist may fill an order for a flowering plant with the largest most showy healthiest specimen in the shop believing he is giving the customer a top quality product if the customer desires a plant for the center of her dining table however she will reject the plant as oversized and certain to inhibit conversation between guests seated around the table if she is not satisfied with the plant it is not a quality product a nursery grower may set exacting standards for tree production every tree is shaped sheared and spaced to produce a block of plants that are exact duplicates the nursery perceives and advertises its plants as being the highest quality if the client wants matching trees to line a formal entry then the trees possess the quality sought if the client wants trees to create a naturalized woodland effect the trees wont do the job they lack quality as perceived by the customer regardless of the growers opinion or the price a lawn that is installed to textbook standards may exhibit lush greenness and weedfree growth is it quality perhaps if the client has water available to maintain it if the local weather is droughty then perhaps not in recent years americas dominance of the world economy has lessened our former international customers are now our competitors in matters of quality the teacher has become the student and american businesspeople are having to observe and learn from other nations the success of foreign manufacturers and service firms most notably the japanese has been accomplished through hard work clever management and a different way of defining and measuring quality quality defined while it is not easy to gain widespread acceptance of a new definition for a familiar term the business world is beginning to understand that there is no quality standard for a product or service until the customers satisfaction is registered giving the customers exactly what they want plus an extra measure of value without additional charge is or should be the goal of every business in america today quality meeting the customers requirements and exceeding those expectations this new definition means that the customer becomes the judge of quality and that the businessperson must find ways of measuring the customers satisfaction the new definition also means that the product or service must provide additional features that surpass the customers expectations if the business is a service firm it may deliver the service at a level higher than the customer expected if the business deals in products those products may offer additional features without costing more than similar products without those features consider these examples example 1 two florists design equally well and charge the same for their service both deliver to customers homes for an order of cut flowers both add extra greens and wrap them in green waxed tissue at the time of delivery the delivery person for one florist rings the customers doorbell hands the roses to the person answering turns and leaves the delivery person for the other florist rings the bell smiles at the person who answers and says ive got a bouquet of fresh flowers for mary jones smith florist really appreciates your business tucked inside the wrapping is a packet of material that can be dissolved in water to prolong the life of the customers flowers which florist has exceeded the customers expectations example 2 a landscape firm has a reputation as being high priced yet continues to be successful why would customers regularly pay more for landscape services obtainable elsewhere at a lower price perhaps it is because they know that they will get exactly those materials and services they are expecting and on time in addition the companys crew will be dressed in clean uniforms each day using clean equipment and vehicles if the customer has a question or concern there will always be someone on the site who can answer the question and resolve the concern other companies may be as competent technically but allow their employees to work with their shirts off or report to work poorly groomed the trucks may be dirty rusted or of different colors customer questions may go unanswered or problems unresolved until someone with authority arrives to respond the value added by the successful company explains its difference example 3 two wholesale nurseries market a similar product assortment to local retail outlets and landscape contractors one nursery digs the plants delivers them and bills the client the other nursery does the same when clients return unsatisfactory plants one nursery replaces them without question the other nursery replaces them then follows up with a written or telephoned inquiry to determine why some of the plants were unsatisfactory to the customer that nursery is measuring client satisfaction and at the same time learning something that may enable it to change and improve its production process total quality management tqm defined putting the new definition of quality into the management methods of a company requires a departure from some deeprooted traditions in american business now outdated are the beliefs that the company sets the standard of quality and that the time to measure standards is at the end of the process if a shrub was unsatisfactory at the time of delivery it was replaced if a poinsettia had whiteflies when delivered the grower apologized to the retailer and replaced it if the patio wasnt graded correctly and surface water ran toward the house it was torn out and done again heads may have rolled later back at the company all such action awaited delivery of the product or service before applying standards or measuring client satisfaction that was the old way and it isnt working anymore total quality management tqm recognizes the client as the only real quality inspector of a company it also regards the provision of a product or service as a process a series of steps that begin with the first contact with the customer and proceed through to delivery of the product or service the billing and the followup the process may have many steps or only a few but each step must be designed to fit efficiently with those that come before and after each step must also be totally understandable to the person responsible for accomplishing it if each step in a process is understood by the person doing it and every step of the process is done properly then the result will be correctness the product or service at the end of the process will meet the companys standards and satisfy the customer with accompanying cost efficiency and reduced waste as the quality goes up the costs go down total quality management managing a company in a manner that allows continuous improvement of its services products processes and organization to satisfy the requirements of its customers and exceed their expectations horticultural businesses that want to apply tqm must begin by identifying all of the processes that make up the business then the steps within each process must be recognized and assessed to learn whether each step links efficiently to those on either side or whether there is duplication omission or an opportunity for confusion here is an example of a sequence of processes in a flower shop 1 receive customer inquiry 2 make the sale 3 prepare the arrangement 4 deliver the arrangement 5 bill the customer 6 follow up to determine customer satisfaction each of these processes can in turn be divided into several steps that flow in sequence in our example the process of preparing the arrangement might include this series of steps 1 order the flowers and greens 2 order the containers picks waterretention media wire tapes and other construction materials 3 schedule the work 4 construct the arrangement 5 package the arrangement in preparation for delivery in a large shop and during a busy season several people may be involved in the process each employee must be trained to understand his or her particular role in each process and how to do it efficiently and effectively the employee must then pass the output of his or her effort to the next person who will use that output in the accomplishment of the next step in the sequence if each step is done correctly and each process proceeds with maximum efficiency the job will be accomplished without waste and to the highest standard management attention can be focused on each step within the processes to isolate and correct problems before they affect the end product or service here is another example of processes and steps in a landscape job sequence of processes 1 sell the job 2 schedule the job 3 procure the materials 4 install the job 5 clean up 6 bill the client 7 honor all guarantees 8 follow up to determine client satisfaction steps in the procurement of materials 1 review the takeoff list quantities of materials needed 2 check sources for availability of materials 3 determine dates when materials are needed at the job site 4 order materials and specify delivery dates 5 receive delivery and verify the orders by monitoring each step in each process managers are able to identify timeconsuming repetitions distracting sidetracks or gaps that make the landscape service less than it could be correcting small problems within the process training employees to do their jobs correctly and passing the output to the next employee in a form that permits the next step to get underway on schedule with all needed data or materials is the new role of managers,the end of world war ii positioned the united states as a dominant economic power with its factories transitioning from war goods to a variety of consumer products during this time american businesses defined quality based on their own standards emphasizing finished products or services while excluding customer input in the quality assessment process this led to a disconnect where products deemed high quality by producers could be rejected by customers based on their specific needs as global competition emerged particularly from japan american companies began to recognize that true quality is defined by customer satisfaction total quality management tqm shifts the focus to continuous improvement of products services and processes to meet and exceed customer expectations tqm involves redefining quality as meeting customer requirements and adds value without extra cost implementing tqm requires businesses to assess all processes ensuring each step is efficient and comprehensible for example in a flower shop the process from receiving customer inquiries to followups can be broken down into specific tasks by focusing on these processes managers can identify and rectify inefficiencies ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and reducing costs
the professions of floriculture the floriculture industry is involved with the production distribution and utilization of floral products and related goods and services it is a multibillion dollar industry annually in the united states businesses range in size from small neighborhood flower shops to corporations engaging in international trade products can be as oldfashioned as a prom corsage and as modern as new computer technology the following descriptions can only provide a rudimentary idea of what floriculture workers do diversity is commonplace and diverse skills abilities and interests are an asset to anyone who would seek employment within this complex industry growers floriculture crops are grown in greenhouses and other growing structures described in chapter 20 they are also grown outdoors in climates in which the winter season is short or nonexistent firms that grow flowering and foliage plants may emphasize cut flower production potted crop production or both figures 151 and 152 firms may also choose not to grow crops to maturity but instead to propagate them and provide rooted cuttings or other reproductive stock to other growers growers should have a knowledge of assorted crop plants although their knowledge can easily become limited when they grow only a few crops on a repeating basis knowledge of proper production hygiene is essential coupled with the ability to prevent and control the insects and diseases to which the crops are susceptible the essence of production knowhow is the ability to manipulate the environment around the plants in a way that will benefit the crops not hamper their development figure 153 the grower may be the owner of the operation or an employee in production operations the grower is a key figure who is given great responsibility and permitted little error large operations may employ several chief growers each supervising several assistant growers except for the grower who also owns the business growers are regarded as skilled laborers they may acquire their skills through university programs onthejob training or both in any case they must constantly update their knowledge through attendance at workshops seminars and industry tours competition from other firms both inside the country and abroad requires that growers stay abreast of the latest information most growing operations are wholesale firms whose clientele are retail florists still there are small growers who retail their own products and produce only what they need rural communities often attract or perhaps necessitate growerretailers because of their distance from suppliers in addition to the professionals described a growing operation may also employ several unskilled laborers who perform valuable tasks to support the growers efforts these laborers may have no technical education or experience when they begin work but are often highly motivated to learn after several years they may qualify as skilled laborers within the same firm or in a similar operation wholesale suppliers these vendors serve as centralized sources for the countless items needed by the professions producers and retailers most wholesale suppliers stock materials needed by either growers or retail florists but seldom try to serve both due to the dissimilarity of their needs wholesalers who supply growers provide almost everything but plants their inventory includes tools of all types artificial media and soil additives lights containers greenhouse materials pesticides and hundreds of other items needed to produce and distribute quality crops wholesalers who supply the nations flower shops and floral designers serve as sources for cut flowers from all over the world they also provide the materials necessary to transform cut flowers into flower shop products dried plastic and silk materials decorative containers ribbons paints gift items register tapes boxes and so on staffing the wholesale supply house are warehouse workers who keep the extensive inventories accounted for and organized and sales floor personnel to serve the customers many wholesalers also have a staff of traveling salespeople to call on customers personally to take and deliver their orders numerous middle management positions are available in wholesaling college education in horticulture with a business emphasis provides the best background flower shops and garden centers the retail outlets for the floriculture industry are the flower shops and garden centers of the nation some are small corporate chains and some are operated as part of larger retail stores notably sears roebuck walmart k mart home depot and some supermarket chains most are small privately owned businesses it is through these retail shops that floral products reach the final consumer figure 154 the typical flower shop provides a full floral design service and carries potted flowers and foliage plants on a regular or seasonal basis the shop may also sell gift items greeting cards or candy christmas decorations may be added during the holiday season garden centers always carry woody plant materials but many have a floral design service as well garden centers are a major outlet for the retail sale of bedding plants and bulbs their inventory may be diversified with floral products as well as pet supplies firewood christmas trees and seed the retail outlet may consist of a store with nearby parking or it may include a sales yard andor greenhouses the owner or manager must be a skilled merchant with business training as well as training in horticulture training of shop personnel techniques of promotion and marketing customer relations purchasing practices accounting and computer use are only some of the business subjects that a retail operator must deal with daily a retail center requires a general practitioner of business management not a specialist since a retail flower shop or garden center is a small business the owners are likely to be directly involved with the services or goods offered they may be floral designers greenhouse workers or salespeople unloading trucks developing displays answering customers questions and running the cash registerall are as likely to be done by the owner as by an employee there are few opportunities to play chairman of the board in a retail flower shop or garden center the education required to be a horticulture retailer can be obtained through college programs at the two or fouryear level the ideal program would include technical training in both ornamental horticulture and business management many retailers unable to attend a university full time enroll in parttime programs others take advantage of the short courses and educational workshops offered by the cooperative extension service or industry trade organizations still others keep up by reading texts journals and magazine articles that cover retailing in general and horticulture in particular floral design and sales floral design is the artistic craft of the floriculture profession in the hands of floral designers floral crops are transformed into the products desired by consumers figure 155 the floral designer must posses a sufficient knowledge of postharvest plant physiology to prolong the life of cut flowers and foliage as long as possible the designer must also be able to select and assemble colors shapes textures and materials for floral arrangements tailored to the needs of each client the designer must have the vision of an artist yet be comfortable repeating many of the same tasks dozens of times floral designers are usually expected to be salespeople also waiting on customers taking orders on the telephone consulting with future brides expectant fathers and bereaved families require sensitive interpersonal skills knowing when to offer a suggestion and when to just listen are desirable qualities in those who would sell as well as design the position of floral designer is highly important in any shop or garden center that offers floral arrangements the designer may or may not be the owner of the business and may or may not be the only designer on the staff floral designers are trained in several ways courses are offered at two and fouryear colleges as part of degree programs in ornamental horticulture a course or two may also be offered as electives in nonhorticulture programs but they are usually directed at hobbyists and are of limited use floral design training schools also exist where aspiring designers receive concentrated training these are noncollege programs that provide the graduate with a certificate on completion landscape floriculture specialist corporate center landscapes commonly use lavish floral displays to convey their image to their employees their customers and the general public figure 156 developers will use flowers as one means of marketing their properties to prospective tenants many cities are now using extensive floral displays to enrich their downtown zones and their gateway entries as a result many landscape contractors now have specialized crews that focus their efforts entirely on the floral displays at the client sites a typical floriculture crew would be composed of a crew leader who is knowledgeable of the handling installation and seasonal care of the flowers being installed the crew leader may also be responsible for designing the layout of the beds and preparing the contracts with the growers who will produce the large quantity of plants needed the crew leader may also be required to train the crew members who will install and maintain the plantings teacherresearcher one of the most difficult positions to fill on an agricultural college faculty is that of the floriculture teacher with graduate degrees required the number of qualified applicants is significantly less than for any other type of agriculture teaching apparently few individuals pursue education in floriculture beyond the associate or bachelor degree level and even fewer choose teaching or research as career fields most collegeeducated floriculturists go to work for industry the shortage of qualified floriculture teachers has existed for some time and shows no sign of disappearing teachers find good opportunities at both the high school and university levels the shortage of scientific researchers is not as critical although it is not an overcrowded career field either usually a minimum of a masters degree is required for teaching and a doctorate is needed for a university research position teachers help students explore a career field that seems to hold some interest for them the selection of a career field of study is a critical decision in everyones life and a good teacher can be of tremendous importance to the student teachers are also responsible for introducing students to many of the skills and techniques used daily by floriculture professionals figure 157 by representing the industry in the classroom teachers provide their students with insight into the careers they are seeking and help them build confidence in their ability to succeed scientific researchers are constantly seeking ways to improve crops and methods of production figure 158 their research may include selective breeding to develop new and better plant varieties it may involve searching for better control of old and recurring pest problems it may involve searching for ways to lengthen the postharvest life of flowers or ways to produce more crops in less bench area or for less cost it is the researchers of the profession who keep the industry looking and moving forward it is the teachers who train young professionals to seek new ideas and methods and to apply them,the floriculture industry involves the production distribution and sale of floral products forming a significant economic sector in the us various career opportunities exist within this field growers cultivate floral crops in greenhouses or outdoors requiring knowledge of plant care pest management and environmental control they can be owners or skilled laborers wholesale suppliers provide necessary materials for growers and retailers including tools and floral design supplies these roles often require a background in horticulture and business flower shops and garden centers serve as retail outlets where consumers purchase floral products owners must possess horticultural and business skills to manage operations effectively floral designers create arrangements combining artistic vision with knowledge of plant physiology they also engage in sales and customer service landscape floriculture specialists focus on designing and maintaining floral displays in public and corporate spaces often leading installation crews teachers and researchers in floriculture require advanced degrees teachers inspire students while researchers innovate methods for crop production and pest control this diverse industry thrives on a blend of artistic technical and business skills
the landscape broadly defined all the spaces outside our buildings constitute the landscape beautiful or hideous natural or scarred by human blundering the landscape usually reflects some degree of human control a landscaper is someone whose profession it is to control and develop the landscape different types of landscapers landscapes can range in size from a small backyard to a vast parkland and control and development can range in scope from the pruning of a single plant to the design of entire gardens it follows that landscape careers will vary in their daytoday operations and in the academic preparation they require each of the following has a role in the landscape industry landscape architect or designer landscape contractor landscape gardener or maintenance supervisor landscape nurseryman landscape architects and designers landscape architects and designers conceive the ideas that later find form in the landscape they see the gardens in their minds before the gardens exist in reality it is the landscape architect who seeks out and studies sites that are to be developed to meet specific human needs the landscape architect identifies all the capabilities and limitations of the site to determine its suitability for the clients purposes figures 171 and 172 in addition to being a competent horticulturist the landscape architect must possess enough knowledge of geology hydrology agronomy engineering and architecture to work closely with professionals in these fields such affiliations become necessary in large or complex site studies once the site has been selected and the needs of the client determined the landscape architect formulates the design that will satisfy those needs working through a series of stages rough drafts concept designs final designs planting plans and working drawings the landscape architect turns ideas into graphic plans and models these enable the client to react to the ideas and approve them or suggest changes later the ideas become detailed explanations to the contractor of how the design is to be installed figures 173 174 175 and 176 landscape architects seldom actually install the landscape but usually supervise those who do the landscape architect is the clients representative from beginning to end and normally has the right of final approval when the installation is complete landscape architect and landscape designer are terms that are often used interchangeably in most states they are licensed professions and can be practiced only by those holding state certification in other states landscape architects may require certification while landscape designers do not in a few other states neither term is restricted by such rules the general trend across the country is to license landscape architects and designers entry into this area of landscaping usually requires extensive schooling and work experience landscape contractors landscape contractors construct and install the landscapes designed by the landscape architects or designers where legally permissible landscape contractors may also offer a design service to their client usually at the residential or other smallscale level in general though a landscape contractor is an ornamental horticulturist and a builder rolled into one the procurement and installation of the plants specified by the landscape architectdesigner are major responsibilities of the contractor proper installation may require laying out the planting beds conditioning or replacing the soil placing the plants staking mulching and other necessities of successful transplanting if lawn installation is required the landscape contractor may need knowledge of cultivator operation seed bed preparation sodding watering and other techniques many landscape plans also specify the construction of walls walks fences patios pools lighting systems fountains and other nonplant items the landscape contractor must be prepared to offer these services or to hire or subcontract the job to some other specialist who can do the work figures 177 through 179 landscape contracting is active outdoor work those who pursue it as a career should enjoy physically demanding labor the financial investment required to operate successfully can be considerable large and expensive machinery is needed if land grading backhoeing treemoving or similar services are offered the labor transportation and equipment costs of several crews are great cost of land is relatively minor though since the work usually requires only an office and storage space for equipment and material landscape gardeners and maintenance supervisors landscape gardeners and maintenance supervisors are responsible for the care of landscapes after they have been installed by the contractors and approved by the landscape architectsdesigners landscape maintenance involves such tasks as mowing edging beds pruning shrubs and trees planting flower beds weeding fertilizing watering repairing surfacing walls or fencing replacing dead plants and directing the growth of plants over a span of years because good landscapes take many years to mature the role of the maintenance landscaper is of vital importance once mature the landscape requires care and attention to ensure its continuing success figures 1710 through 1713 maintenance landscapers may be resident employees as on large estates or they may be independent businesspeople who work under long or shortterm contracts for clients a knowledge of horticulture appreciation of plants and understanding of the many factors that can affect plant growth are essential to success in this career field many opportunities exist and the investment capital needed to begin is considerably less than for landscape contracting a young person just out of school can begin by offering a few maintenance services those not requiring expensive equipment and build the business as profits allow with the almost explosive growth of commercial landscapes in the last decade landscape management companies that offer total site maintenance have proliferated there are numerous and attractive employment opportunities with established landscape management firms across the country for anyone who has training in horticulture coupled with a strong sense of business landscape management maintenance companies are the fastest growing members of the national landscape industry the best landscapes result from close cooperation between the landscape architect the landscape contractor and the landscape maintenance gardener many problems of installation and maintenance can be avoided and the intent of a design is best achieved if the designer talks with the people responsible for implementing the design and caring for it afterwards landscape nurserymen the sale of plant materials is the primary objective of the landscape nurserymans business an installation service is also offered as a means of promoting and supplementing the sale of the plants serving homeowners more than other types of clients the landscape nurseryman engages in smallscale projects such as foundation plantings patios and installing trees and shrubs the business seldom expands into areas such as construction or followup maintenance as suburban living spreads the future for landscape nurserymen looks bright there is a good market of homeowners who want professional assistance in getting their residential properties planted but are then willing to care for the landscape themselves,the landscape encompasses all outdoor spaces shaped by human intervention various professionals contribute to its development landscape architects and designers envision and plan landscapes to meet client needs assessing site conditions and collaborating with other experts they create designs through drafts and models supervising installations without typically carrying them out themselves landscape contractors execute the designs created by architects they handle plant installation soil preparation and may also construct nonplant elements like walls and patios this physically demanding work requires knowledge of horticulture and machinery landscape gardeners and maintenance supervisors care for landscapes postinstallation performing tasks such as mowing pruning and planting their role is vital for the longterm health of the landscape ensuring its beauty and functionality over time landscape nurserymen sell plants and may provide installation services for residential projects their focus is on smallscale landscaping catering to homeowners seeking assistance with plant selection and installation collaboration among architects contractors gardeners and nurserymen is essential for creating and maintaining successful landscapes
hoosing or changing a career there are two truly difficult tasks in almost everyones life choosing a spouse and choosing a career this text can offer no assistance with the first task but it can with the second at least to those with a yet untested interest in ornamental horticulture so far this section has described the traditional careers in ornamental horticulture those careers have been attracting people to the profession for many years and will continue to do so many persons have entered the profession after preparation at colleges and trade schools others have entered as the sons and daughters of industry personnel still others have had few prior credentials but a sincere interest and willingness to work hard the industry is sufficiently diverse and healthy to accommodate a work force that ranges from the wageearning laborer to the salaried scientist still there are individuals whose interest in ornamental horticulture is just as genuine but who seek different ways to apply the interest they include but are not limited to people who wish to supplement their income with parttime work in ornamental horticulture be involved with both the applied and the scientific branches of the profession combine their interest in ornamental horticulture with their desire to serve others specialize in the care of a single type of plant combine their interest in ornamental horticulture with an interest in writing or other modes of communication parttime work for many ornamental horticulture is an avocation a hobby and leisuretime pursuit they enjoy arranging flowers from their garden and filling their homes with plants they may have a small backyard greenhouse others may have studied the profession in high school or college but later stepped out of the business world to raise children such persons often seek to supplement the family income by working on weekends or during peak holiday periods in flower shops greenhouses or garden centers for many it is a satisfying way to turn avocation to vocation florists are often eager to employ the temporary services of persons able to make bows and puffs add greenery to arrangements and wait on customers during holidays or as replacements for vacationing staff members greenhouse growers also need vacation replacements and workers to water and maintain the crop during weekends landscapers and nurseries often need a large work force during the spring and fall but not year round so parttime and temporary workers fit their needs ideally some parttime workers are selfemployed operating from their homes they often specialize in dried or silk arrangements terrariums and novelty items others may sell spring bedding plants or cemetery arrangements for use on memorial day then close down and return to their regular jobs it is impossible to speculate on how much income is generated by parttime selfemployed practitioners because little data is available other workers have fulltime careers that involve them with the ornamental horticulture industry during part of the working day examples include the small engine repairer who works on the lawn mowers sprayers chain saws and other power equipment of landscapers and groundskeepers general maintenance staffers often are required to care for interior or exterior landscape installations in office complexes shopping centers hospitals and schools restaurant and resort managers may have flower arrangements on tables and in lobbies and need a regular floral supplier just as they need a food supplier cooperative extension specialists in nearly every state the cooperative extension specialist is considered a member of the professional staff of the state college of agriculture the specialists constituency is offcampus and includes industry practitioners homeowners and 4h youth the purpose of the cooperative extension service is to process the latest information from universities and private research firms worldwide into a form that can be understood and used by the services constituency then to disseminate that information cooperative extension is a university outreach service and its specialists need skills appropriate to the task figure 181 specialists must be university educated and have industry experience they must read well and be able to organize and simplify complex material cooperative extension specialists must enjoy organizing and leading workshops and tours they must be comfortable with public speaking and they must write well like teachers extension agents must have an aboveaverage mastery of all communication skills people are at the center of the cooperative extension effort people with problems and questions people of all ages and intellects predictably many of their questions are the same so agents must also have patience and the desire to help some cooperative extension specialists work from offices responding to homeowners questions by telephone others are traveling troubleshooters responsible to growers in several counties still others work through radio television and the news media the particular location and constituency usually define how the agent must work to reach the greatest number of people most cooperative extension specialists have bachelors degrees in their fields of specialization and many have masters degrees horticulture therapists both teaching and cooperative extension offer an opportunity to work in ornamental horticulture while working with people on a personal level in both situations the clientele are usually healthy and typical of average americans in addition special populations of citizens can be served by ornamental horticulturists the elderly the physically handicapped the mentally retarded and the imprisoned have all been found responsive to therapists with horticultural skills certain crafts of ornamental horticulture are eagerly learned by elderly citizens at club meetings church groups and even in nursing homes figure 182 flower arranging terrarium construction houseplant care seed propagation and patio gardening are all activities that can be taught as part of a senior citizens activity program many of the elderly bring a rich background of gardening to their senior years and are knowledgeable students even the more infirm enjoy working with plants often their hands are still agile and talented even though their bodies are confined to chairs working with living growing materials is satisfying for nearly everyone the elderly are no exception it also offers them an opportunity for rolereversal in which they can direct the growth and wellbeing of a living thing instead of being the recipient of direction although job opportunities exist in horticulture for handicapped workers some may not yet be confident or skilled enough to enter the workforce for the physically handicapped training in ornamental horticulture skills can increase manual dexterity build selfconfidence alleviate frustration and perhaps offer hope of a meaningful career some mentally challenged persons are trainable and employable others have physical handicaps or limited coordination still many possess the patience and desire to learn that are necessary to accomplish some of the craft skills of ornamental horticulture therapists use skill training as one means of developing a sense of selfworth and accomplishment in their clients prisoners have also proved responsive to programs that allow them to work with the materials of nature while developing skills that offer hope of employment after their release as a rehabilitation tool ornamental horticulture training is proving its value yet the number of programs nationally is limited due to a lack of instructors willing to work within the penal system while the clients of therapists can vary greatly the education and personal qualities required of the therapist are similar an increasing number of colleges are offering courses even majors in the use of horticulture as a tool of therapy training in the techniques of horticulture is combined with courses in the behavioral sciences physical education and the needs of special populations compassion patience and a call to human service are important personal characteristics of professionals in the field of horticulture therapy also necessary is the ability to remain objective toward the often tragic circumstances of the clients horticulture therapy is not a career that should be pursued by overly empathetic people harsh though that advice may sound,selecting a career can be as challenging as choosing a life partner particularly for those interested in ornamental horticulture this field attracts a diverse workforce from laborers to scientists accommodating individuals with varying backgroundswhether educated in horticulture following family traditions or pursuing interests in a new direction parttime work many find fulfillment in parttime roles transforming hobbies into income sources opportunities abound in flower shops greenhouses and landscaping businesses where temporary positions can be ideal for those looking to supplement family income selfemployed individuals may create unique floral arrangements or maintain small gardens cooperative extension specialists these professionals work as outreach agents helping the public understand horticultural practices they need strong communication skills public speaking abilities and industry knowledge often requiring bachelors or masters degrees horticulture therapists this branch focuses on using horticulture as a therapeutic tool for vulnerable populations including the elderly and individuals with disabilities therapists require specialized training in horticulture and behavioral sciences along with compassion and patience to effectively support their clients overall the ornamental horticulture field offers varied paths for those interested in both applied practices and therapeutic applications
arborists and lawn care specialists two specialized career fields have developed quite recently compared to other fields in ornamental horticulture arborists arborists are tree maintenance specialists their services include insect and disease control trimming fertilizing cabling cavity treatment woodlot thinning and tree and stump removal figure 183 some would dispute their classification as an occupation of ornamental horticulture preferring the term urban forestry indisputably arborists work with trees of all types forest trees street trees lawn trees ornamental trees and fruit trees it is vigorous outdoor work and potentially dangerous the use of power tools the climbing involved the possibility of unexpected weak limbs and the difficulty of seeing power lines all call for care and skill training is available through university programs in ornamental horticulture forestry or both there is some conflict over which academic discipline has the closest affinity to the profession interested individuals should take a discerning look at the curriculum offerings of the college they are considering not the program titles to determine the quality and suitability of the training collegelevel programs are offered at the two and fouryear levels laborer positions are available for nongraduates the industry is becoming increasingly professional in its methods and its expectations this is due in part to the efforts of the national arborist association and its state chapters and the international society of arboriculture frequent local national and international meetings in addition to newsletters and audiovisual programs keep the indus trys professionals abreast of new techniques an attempt to certify all arborists nationwide is now underway confirming the professions commitment to both education and skill development lawn care specialists lawn care specialists are concerned with the maintenance of turfgrass installations both residential and commercial clients contract for their services which include a full season of insect and disease control fertilization grassy and broadleaf weed control aeration and in small firms may also include installation and mowing if there is a genuine american horticulture success story it is the lawn care industry essentially it created itself in 1969 when a novice company began convincing homeowners and commercial firms that it could maintain lawns better than the clients could and at an affordable price that first year annual sales totaled 218 thousand by 1979 annual sales for the same firm were nearly 87 million inspired by the success of the industry leader which now operates nationwide smaller operations have sprung up in every metropolitan area and expanded the industry still further figures 184 and 185 the services are primarily chemical application services lawn care specialists have a route of customers who are all to receive a particular treatment program each day the specialist will mix a tank truck full of the fertilizer or pesticide to be applied and make the rounds lawn care specialists may also be responsible for preparing bids to acquire new customers during the offseason the repair of trucks sprayers and other equipment and attendance at trade shows and short courses ensure that the specialist stays current in the field and is ready to begin again when the growing season resumes if the career has a limitation it is the very long hours required during the spring summer and fall a route may include several hundred customers each property requiring four to six treatments each season generally offseason hours are shorter and vacations are taken then preparation for the position of lawn care specialist should include at least a twoyear college education since the hiring trend is definitely in that direction majors in ornamental horticulture turfgrass management or agronomy can all provide the background needed for successful placement in the field additional training or personal skills in power equipment care and maintenance can prove helpful as will good communication skills special operators licenses may be needed for some equipment and pesticide applicator certification is also required,arborists specialize in the maintenance and care of trees offering services like insect and disease control trimming fertilizing and tree removal while some view arborists as part of urban forestry rather than ornamental horticulture their work spans a variety of tree types including forest street and ornamental trees the role involves rigorous outdoor labor often requiring the use of power tools and climbing skills making safety a top priority training programs in ornamental horticulture and forestry are available at various educational levels but prospective arborists should focus on curriculum quality over program titles professional organizations like the national arborist association are instrumental in advancing industry standards and certifying arborists highlighting a commitment to education and skill development lawn care specialists focus on maintaining turfgrass in both residential and commercial settings this growing industry began in the late 1960s quickly proving its value to homeowners and businesses alike specialists provide services like fertilization weed control and aeration often following a seasonal treatment schedule successful candidates typically have at least a twoyear college degree in fields like ornamental horticulture or turfgrass management with additional training in equipment maintenance and pesticide application being beneficial despite demanding hours during peak seasons lawn care specialists play a crucial role in maintaining healthy landscapes
15 biodiversity of sri lanka trends and linkages to human wellbeing 151 general description of sri lanka sri lanka is a moderatesized continental island listed as the 25th largest island in the world calder 2009 sri lanka belongs among the equatorial belt of countries as it lies just south of the tropic of cancer between 5 55 and 9 51 north latitude and 79 41 and 81 54 east longitude sri lanka is endowed with a coastline of 1620 km the continental shelf around the northern and northwestern part of the island is broad but the shelf ends more abruptly in the south and east of the island conforming with the united nations convention on the law of the sea unclos 1982 and the maritime zones law no 22 of 1976 sri lanka has different areas of national maritime jurisdiction as shown in figure 1 based on the geological evidence sri lanka has been in existence for nearly three billion years from the proterozoic era 2500542 mya up to the jurassic period sri lanka remained part of the gondwana super continent katupotha 2013 during the jurassic period approximately 158160 mya the indomadagascar plate drifted away from east africa followed by the separation of the deccan plate from madagascar around 8496 mya briggs 2003 figure 2 after the separation from madagascar the deccan plate underwent a period of isolation for about 3040 million years before colliding with the eurasian plate around 4050 mya with the collision of the deccan and eurasian plates there was an exchange of biota between asia and peninsular india consequently the biotic ferry model was proposed according to which the deccan plate functioned as a raft carrying ancient gondwanan forms to asia upon collision with asia these gondwanan forms dispersed out of india and into asia also called the outofindia hypothesis karanth 2006 likewise palaearctic mammals such as the hippopotamuses hexaprotodon rhinoceros rhinoceros elephants palaeoloxodon hyselephas and elephas lions and tigers panthera dispersed into india also called the into india hypothesis during periods of glaciations prater 1971 therefore the geological history of sri lanka can be subdivided into four phases i the predrift phase during which sri lanka and india were part of a much larger landmass referred to as gondwana 160 mybp ii the drift phase ending with the collision of the deccan plate and the asiatic continent between 50 and 40 mybp iii the miocene epoch 25 mybp during which sri lanka separated from the indian subcontinent following a series of complex tectonic movements which began in the jurassic era and iv the quaternary epoch two mybp to present during which sea level changes driven by climate cycles resulted in repeated formation of land bridges between india and sri lanka in the palk strait region katupotha 2013 swan 1983 at present sri lanka has a diverse topography that has resulted from periods of upliftment and erosion the net result of these processes has been the creation of the central hills with many peaks and in cross section a steplike arrangement referred to as peneplains the first peneplain extends from 0 metres above sea level to 300 metres the second peneplain rises from 301 to 1500 metres in this area the land rises gently with low rounded hills and crests of hard rock the third peneplain is the central mountain area consisting of plateaus mountain chains and basins extending from 1501 to over 2100 metres with some peaks such as piduruthalgala 2524 m kirigalpotta 2395 m totapola 2357 m and sri pada adams peak 2243 m reaching elevations greater than 2200 m survey dept 2007 the resulting landform thus has many escarpments ridges and valleys in the rolling first peneplain are some rock islands called inselbergs jutting out of the relatively flat terrain figure 3 the montane region covers about three percent of the island and comprises three distinct mountain ranges that have been isolated from each other for many thousands of years and hence harbour unique faunal and floral elements the drainage pattern of the country is almost entirely governed by the central highlands with all the perennial watercourses originating in the mountains the country is dissected by 103 river basins figure 4 the river flow contributes to the creation of some unique ecosystems in the flood plain areas although sri lanka has no natural lakes the dry zone is dotted with nearly 10000 ancient irrigation reservoirs relics of an ancient hydraulic civilization also called tanks from the portuguese tanque extending in total over nearly 60000 ha and providing perennial and seasonal sources of water survey dept 2007 figure 5 sri lankas climate is largely governed by the monsoonal winds and affected by the central hills the seasonality of rainfall influenced by two distinct monsoons and convectional and cyclonic effects as well as the rain shadow effect caused by the central mountains has given rise to six bioclimatic zones wijesinghe et al1993 the low and midcountry wet zone extends over much of the southwest part of the island and has a mean annual rainfall of 25005000 mm and is stratified into low mid and montane regions that rise to 2500 m above msl because of this altitudinal variation the mean temperature of the wet zone drops progressively from 27 c in the lowlands to around 13 c 16 c in the montane areas with occasional ground frosts at high elevations temperature plays an important role in the highland regions where decreasing temperature at higher elevations along with the wind has resulted in unique natural communities the dry zone with a mean daily temperature of 30 c is spread over much of the lowland plains the rainfall of 1250 mm 1900 mm per year is not spread evenly through the year and there is a long dry period of about five months during these dry months rainfall is less than 50 mm per month there are two extra dry coastal strips with prolonged drought periods in the northwest and southeast coastal regions forming the arid zone with a mean annual rainfall less than 1250 mm a narrow intermediate zone with a mean annual rainfall of 1900 2500 mm lies between the wet and dry zones as does the montane intermediate zone see figure 6 for all of the above,sri lanka the 25th largest island globally lies in the equatorial belt just south of the tropic of cancer with a coastline of 1620 km its geological history spans nearly three billion years initially part of the gondwana supercontinent the islands diverse topography shaped by tectonic movements features three distinct peneplains and the central highlands with peaks over 2200 meters such as piduruthalgala and adams peak the climate is heavily influenced by monsoonal winds creating six bioclimatic zones the low and midcountry wet zone primarily in the southwest receives 25005000 mm of annual rainfall and has a temperature range from 27c in lowlands to 1316c in montane areas in contrast the dry zone with temperatures averaging 30c receives 12501900 mm of rainfall annually characterized by a lengthy dry season sri lankas intricate drainage system consists of 103 river basins contributing to unique floodplain ecosystems the country lacks natural lakes but boasts nearly 10000 ancient irrigation reservoirs this biodiversity influenced by diverse climates and geological history is vital for human wellbeing supporting agriculture tourism and ecosystem services
status of the biodiversity of sri lanka these zoogeographic topographic climatic and edaphic factors have resulted in a diverse array of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and a multitude of coastal and marine ecosystems in addition there are unique humanmade ecosystems such as reservoirs and agricultural landscapes table 1 presents an extended classification including edaphic and anthropogenic variants in consultation with leading ecologists more details of this classification are presented in the section on trends in ecosystems all these ecosystems have contributed to the establishment of rich faunal and floral assemblages with some unique attributes unusual for a moderatesized tropical island sri lankas ecosystem diversity is characterized by various major ecosystem types and their numerous variants the primary ecosystems include forests which are treedominated featuring variants such as lowland wet evergreen forests midelevation evergreen forests montane evergreen forests moistmixed evergreen forests drymixed evergreen forests aridmixed evergreen forests montane upper wet patana montane lower wet patana humid zone dry patana summer zone dry patana upland savannas lowland savannas dry damana grasslands flood plain grasslands aboveground caves belowground caves montane peat bogs and intermediate upper and lower patana grasslands additional ecosystems comprise dry zone grasslands drawdown areas of large tanks pasturelands kekilla fernlands wet talava grasslands abandoned mines railway tunnels public parks and gardens home gardens and abandoned lands and roadsides agro plantations feature both mixed culture and monoculture systems other ecosystems include rock outcrop forests swamp forests and those with springs isolated hill forests riverine evergreen forests sea shore scrublands sand dune scrublands sand dune forests and palmyra woodlands secondary forests sparse open forests and dry deciduous thorn scrublands are also prevalent alongside forest plantations which exist in both monoculture and mixed culture forms fresh and brackish water ecosystems encompass fresh and brackish water villus rivers and streams springs and marshes marine ecosystems are represented by sandy shores rocky shores gravelly shores dead coral beaches coral reefs sandstone reefs rocky reefs seagrass meadows seaweeds and varying types of bottoms including mud sand rocky and sandstone the open ocean and various islets rocky sandy and those with vegetation cover add to this diversity humanmade and modified ecosystems include ports harbours river expansion lakes mangroves lagoons flood plains villu salt marshes tidal flats estuaries waterfalls and their spray zones thermal marshes sand dunes reservoirs tanks ponds aquaculture bodies salterns canals and paddy fields lastly the water bodies feature both lentic standing and lotic running systems along with marshlands beaches reefs shallow marine waters less than 200 m deep marine waters more than 200 m and various islets showcasing the rich biodiversity of sri lankas ecosystems the hallmark of sri lankas biodiversity is the presence of large populations of mega fauna such as the asian elephant leopard and sloth bear that do not occur in other moderatesized islands as well as the presence of a large proportion of endemic species among many of the plant vertebrate and invertebrate taxa table 2 moe 2012a sri lanka is home to the largest extant mammal in the world the great blue whale balaenoptera musculus as well as the smallest known mammal by mass the pygmy shrew suncus etruscus sri lanka along with the western ghats of india is listed as one of the 35 biodiversity hotspots of the world ci 2016 designation of a biodiversity hotspot is based on two criteria the presence of 05 or 1500 species of vascular plants as endemics and the reduction of forest cover by 70 or more causing many of the taxa to become threatened with extinction ci 2016 designation of sri lanka as a biodiversity hotspot is based on both of these criteria as there is a high level of endemicity in most taxonomic groups figure 7 and a high proportion of the species in most taxonomic groups are threatened with extinction especially in the case of endemic species figure 17 primarily due to loss of habitat this high level of endemicity may have arisen as a result of multiple factors such as topography climate abundance of water association with multiple land masses during the islands evolutionary history and being a continental island as opposed to a volcanic island these factors would have contributed to repeated cycles of colonization followed by long periods of isolation leading to speciation and resulting in the evolution of many endemic species in other words almost all the evolutionary drivers appear to have operated on sri lanka during its evolutionary history shaping its biodiversity lowering of the sea level during the pleistocene era made it possible for faunal groups to cross over from the indian subcontinent to sri lanka across the palk strait using adams bridge figure 8 this hypothesis is supported by the discovery of tiger fossils panthera tigris from batadomba and alawala caves dated 16700 11600 yr bp and 140008000 yr bp respectively and rhinoceros fossils from lunugala dated 80000 20000 yr bp manamendraaarachchi et al 2005 laurie et al1983 sea level changes also facilitated the movement of small vertebrates such as the ancestors of ceratophora species long periods of isolation between interglacial periods where the sea levels rose cutting off the land connection appear to have led to the process of speciation allowing the evolution of many new species a case in point is the evolution of five species of the genus ceratophora at different altitudinal ranges in sri lanka erdelen 1989 prehistoric humans also appeared to have immigrated to the island during this period as evidenced by the stone tools found in the bundala pathirajawela dated to 125000 yr bp deraniyagala 1986 figure 8 is a schematic drawing of this process of land bridge formation and sea level rise based on the distribution of animals several zonation patterns are recognized in sri lanka senanayake and moyle 1982 have identified four ichthyological zones based on the distribution patterns of freshwater fish namely the mahaweli zone dry zone transition zone and southwestern zone of these four zones the southwestern ichthyological zone supports the highest species richness and endemism figure 9 eisenberg and mckay 1970 also proposed a system for classifying the distribution patterns of mammals in sri lanka based on the climate map of mullerdombois and sirisena 1967 who recognized seven mammalian zones namely monsoon scrub jungle in the northwest a1 and southeast a2 monsoon forest and grassland b inter monsoon forest c rain forests and grasslands below 9144 m 3000 ft d1 between 91441524 m 30005000 ft d2 and above 1524 m 5000 ft d3 of these most of the endemic and threatened mammals of sri lanka are restricted to the zones d1 d2 and d3 more than 75 of the d1 zone falls within the western province figure 10 kotagama 1993 has divided sri lanka into six avifaunal zones based on the distribution patterns of the resident bird species these include the northern zone low country wet zone mid country wet zone and hill country wet zone dry zone and the uva zone as in the case of mammals the low mid and hill country wet zone harbours the highest species richness as well as endemicity of birds figure 11 plants also show a distinct distribution pattern ashton and gunatilleke 1987 taking into consideration the trends in distribution of plants have divided sri lanka into 15 floristic regions in addition wijesinghe et al 1993 assessing distribution patterns of biodiversity and climate have defined six bioclimatic zones for sri lanka finally the ministry of forestry and environment 1999 has divided sri lanka into 15 bioregions based on climate and geophysical classifications the distribution patterns of fauna and flora and the biodiversity richness of different parts of the country figure 12,sri lankas biodiversity is shaped by diverse aquatic terrestrial and coastal ecosystems enriched by unique humanmade environments such as reservoirs and agricultural landscapes the primary ecosystems include various forest typeslike lowland wet evergreen and montane evergreen forestsalong with grasslands wetlands and marine ecosystems like coral reefs and seagrass meadows the island is renowned for its megafauna including the asian elephant and leopard alongside a high level of endemism among its flora and fauna sri lanka is recognized as a biodiversity hotspot due to its substantial proportion of endemic vascular plant species and significant habitat loss geological history climate and ecological factors have contributed to repeated colonization and isolation fostering speciation for example the pleistocene era allowed faunal movement across the palk strait influencing current species distribution several biogeographical zonation patterns exist categorizing aquatic and terrestrial species for instance ichthyological zones classify freshwater fish while mammalian and avifaunal zones highlight distinct distributions influenced by climatic variations these classifications reveal that the southwestern zones support the highest species richness and endemism understanding these ecosystems and their interrelations is critical for conservation efforts and maintaining human wellbeing
contribution of biodiversity and ecosystem services to human wellbeing ecosystem services are the direct and indirect contributions of ecosystems to human wellbeing mea 2005 some ecosystem processes provide direct benefits to humans but many of them provide benefits primarily via indirect interactions the schematic in figure 14 shows the extent of services provided by ecosystems in sri lanka the contribution of biodiversity and ecosystem services to social wellbeing in sri lankan society can be understood by examining some of the provisioning services that they provide in the year 2014 the fisheries sector both inland and marine contributed 18 of gdp a total of 217140 active fishers engaged in fishing in 2014 to provide rupees 176239 million as valueadded revenue from ecosystem services mofard 2015 a forestry sector assessment conducted by the ministry of environment estimated that annual cattle grazing related benefits accrued by local communities were worth rupees 214 million the contribution of hydropower to electricity generation in sri lanka is about 35 according to ceb reportsand the value of electricity generated in 2011 was rupees 46 billion ecosystem services provided by sri lankan ecosystems provisioning services include food sources from natural ecosystems such as lowland wet evergreen forests midelevation evergreen forests montane evergreen forests moistmixed
