# **BioMentor - Personalized E-Learning Platform for A/L Biology Students**

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to develop a personalized e-learning platform tailored for A/L Biology students in Sri Lanka. Leveraging advanced Machine Learning (ML) technologies, the platform provides an adaptive, interactive, and engaging learning environment. The platform enhances biology education by offering features like spaced repetition, advanced text summarization, adaptive quizzes, and detailed answer evaluation.

By addressing the challenges of traditional learning methods, such as static textbooks and standardized exams, this project introduces a dynamic, customized approach to improve students' understanding, engagement, and academic success.
