✅ Proper Order to Set Up a Python Environment for NLP and AI Projects

This guide outlines the correct sequence for setting up a Python environment with necessary dependencies for NLP and AI-related projects.

---

1. ✅ Install Python and Virtual Environment Tools

Before setting up the virtual environment, ensure Python and `venv` are installed.

Linux:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-pip -y
```

macOS:
```bash
brew install python
```

Windows:
Ensure Python is installed from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).

---

2. ✅ Set Up a Virtual Environment

Creating a virtual environment ensures isolation for project dependencies.

Linux/macOS:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Windows (PowerShell):
```bash
python -m venv venv
.
env\Scripts\Activate
```

Deactivate the environment (all platforms):
```bash
deactivate
```

---

3. ✅ Install Required Python Packages

After activating the virtual environment, install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
pip install pymongo matplotlib google-generativeai
pip install transformers sentence-transformers spacy scikit-learn rapidfuzz language-tool-python
pip install pandas sentence-transformers faiss-cpu transformers flask
```

Or install from a `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

4. ✅ Install spaCy Model

Install the English NLP model for spaCy:

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

---

5. ✅ Running Key Scripts

▶️ Start the FastAPI Application:
```bash
uvicorn question_and_answer_api:app --reload
```

▶️ Run the Answer Evaluation Tool:
```bash
python answer_evaluation_tool.py
```

---

6. ✅ Run Test Cases

To run automated test cases written using `pytest`:

🔹 Install `pytest` (if not installed):
```bash
pip install pytest
```

🔹 Run All Tests:
```bash
pytest tests/
```

🔹 Run a Specific Test File:
```bash
pytest tests/test_generate_answers.py
```

🔹 Run with Verbose Output:
```bash
pytest -v
```

🔹 Run a Specific Test Function:
```bash
pytest tests/test_generate_answers.py::test_generate_structured_answer
```

---

✅ Following these steps ensures your environment is fully ready for developing, testing, and running NLP and AI projects.
